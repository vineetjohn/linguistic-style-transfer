I know we'll make it
I know we'll make it through
One thing is for certain I'll BE HERE for you
Don't know you're thinking
Don't wasting what we do
One thing is constant that I'll BE HERE for you

We all go through changes, run to different places
That doesn't mean that we have to part
And when you feel like nobody's on your side
Please believe I'm never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far

I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for you
I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for you

Where do we sunshine, where the heavy rain
Who's on the pressure I had reason...
We all go through changes, run to different places
That doesn't mean that we have to part
And when you feel like nobody's on your side
Please believe I'm never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far

I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for you
I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for you
I will be here for YOU
I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for YOU
I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for YOU

I'll BE HERE for you
I will be here for YOU

And when you cast away and you feel like home
I'll try to find you
I'll try to catch you!

I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for you
I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for you
I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for you
I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for you
I will be here for you
