 When the darts just miss I just can't resist it
Cause  I'm a fool for you and  the things you do
Cause  I'm a fool for you and  the things  the things you do
 The things you do  the things you do
 When you're looking like this
 I  just can't resist it
 I know sometimes  I hide it
But  I can't this time cause it's gonna defeat me
But if you won't believe me believe me
Cause  I'm a fool for you and  the things you do
Cause  I'm a fool for you and  the things  the things you do
 I know  I know given a chance  I'd do it again
Cause  I can't help myself
Cause  I can't stop myself
 I  just love being a fool for you-oh-oh
Cause  I'm a fool for you and  the things you do
Cause  I'm a fool for you and  the things  the things you do
This love is tainted
