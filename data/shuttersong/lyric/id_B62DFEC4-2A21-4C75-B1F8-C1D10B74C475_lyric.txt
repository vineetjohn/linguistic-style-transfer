Calling All Hearts
To the dancefloor, tonight
Let love start

Calling all party people in the place to be
We gonna celebrate tonight
And rock out with the family
Here we go

Calling all hearts (to the dancefloor)
Tonight, let love start
On the dancefloor, tonight
Let's go

I got a feeling everybody need a reason to shout
Leave all your problems and your drama at the door and get down
This is where we all unite
If we get it right, we gonna light up the sky
At this place, in this time
We gotta let go, 'cause it's great

Calling all hearts (to the dancefloor)
Tonight, let love start
On the dancefloor, tonight

Go a little harder with your partner
Heat it up in this place
It's ok to make up
If you take up, put a smile on your face
This is very all you and I
We gonna groove
We gonna move into the night
Have this amazing time, yeah
You gotta let go cause it's alright

Calling all hearts (to the dancefloor)
Tonight, let love start
On the dancefloor, tonight

If the feeling's tonight
