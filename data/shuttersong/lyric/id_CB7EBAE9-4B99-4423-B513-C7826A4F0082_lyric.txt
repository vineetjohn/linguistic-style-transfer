I got a brand new pair from the store
And you know I got on fresh new clothes
Got on flip flops that show off my toes
My friends like "hey bro, what are those?"

Oh my god, oh my god, what is he even wearing?
Take those off immediately
(what are those)
Are, are you wearing sketchers light ups?
Get, get, get out of here, go
(what are those)
Like, like you really reconsider your outfit before you walk out the house
(what are those)
I can't even deal with these basic ass people

Fresh from the head to the feet
Bro what are those?
Shoulda kept the receipt
You're probably ashamed
So keep it low key
But if anybody asks, then you don't know me
Yeah, my whole team fleek (team fleek)
You can't mess with the crew
Go home, yell my grandma fresher than you
Like deeeee
She wanna take a picture, like a pose
I was 'bout to do it 'til I looked down
What are thoooseee?

Bro, where you get those things from?
Are you gonna return 'em?
Get them shoes outta here!

My grandma fresher than you
My grandma fresher than you

My grandma fresher than you
My grandma fresher than you

My grandma fresher than you
My grandma fresher than you
