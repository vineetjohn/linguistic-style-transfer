Imma make you beg, Imma make you beg for it
Imma make you beg, Imma make you beg

Pulled up looking picture perfect, baby
High price, but I'm worth it, baby
Can't play with ya, I've been busy workin', baby
Gettin' faded in the European swervin' ay
Look, describe Iggy ground breaking what the word is
Hit the stage, ass shaking like I'm nervous
When in New York I be parking right on Madison
This ain't no accident, I'm killing them on purpose
I-G-G-Y (Why) did she just have to do it, baby
Ride with me, fly livin', ain't nothin' to it
And my waist slim, ass fat
You gotta have it
Get my bake on
Cake long,
It's automatic

I know you like the way I turn it on
I'm out here with my friends
Imma make you beg, Imma make you beg for it
If you don't do this right, you're going home alone
I guess you'll have to beg
Imma make you beg, Imma make you beg for it

P-p-pussy power, pay me by the hour
I need me a brave heart, can't deal with the coward
I tell 'em if he ain't balling, he should hit the showers
If I pick you, you lucky, baby, this money ours
All yellow gold on me like I'm Trinidad (James)
Sitting drop top wondering where the ceiling's at
I know my old thing, wanna bring the feeling back
But I got a new thing, baby, I ain't feeling that
Now Iggy Iggy, Iggy can't you see that everybody wanna put their hands on me
See I be on this money while your man on me
And I need another hand with all these bands on me

Imma make you beg, Imma make you beg for it

Get up out my face like who'd you think you are
Talking all this trash like blah-di-blah-di-blah
Oe oh, na uh, Oe oh, na uh (Oe oh)
Get up out my face like who'd you think you are
Make me wanna laugh like ha-di-ha-di-ha
Oe oh, na uh, Oe oh, na uh

Hooked boy, I'm like a drug
If you want my love better smoke it up
Make you beg for it, Imma make you beg for it
You can look boy but don't you touch
If you want my love make me give a fuck
Make you beg for it, Imma make you beg for it
