Oh my my my, what you do to me?
Like lighting when I'm swimming in the sea
From the very first time we loved
From the very first time we touched
Walking on wires and power lines
You put your body on top of mine
Every time that you lift me up
To the heavens and stars above
Oh, lord have mercy
I'm begging you, please
I'm feeling drained, I need love
You charge me up like electricity
Jumpstart my heart with your love
There's an energy
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
There's en energy
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I couldn't leave if I wanted to
'Cause something keeps pulling me back to you
From the very first time we loved
From the very first time we touched
The stroke of your fingers
The scent of your lingers
My mind running wild
The thoughts of your smile
Oh, you gotta give me some, and you can give it all, but it's never enough no
There's an energy
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
There's an energy
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
Hold me in your arms
Burns like a fire, electricity
When you're close I feel the sparks
Takes me higher to infinity
