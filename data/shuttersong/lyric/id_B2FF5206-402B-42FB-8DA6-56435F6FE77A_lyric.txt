Hey man, ah leave me alone you know
Hey man, well Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
Hey man, I gotta straighten my face
This mellow black chick just put my spine out of place

Hey man, my school day's insane
Hey man, my work's down the drain
Hey man, well she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she... then she...

Ah don't lean on me man, cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back from Suffragette City
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight... she's all right

Hey man, ah Henry, don't be unkind, go away
Hey man, I can't take you this time, no way
Hey man, d-droogie don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes

Ah don't lean on me man, cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back from Suffragette City
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight... she's all right

Oh hit me!

Ah don't lean on me man, cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back from Suffragette City
Ah don't lean on me man
Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City

Don't lean on me man, cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back from Suffragette City
Don't lean on me man
Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight... wah... she's all right

Ooo, A Suffragette city, Ooo, A Suffragette City
Oooh-haa, A Suffragette City, Oooh-haa, A Suffragette
