Somebody call the police

Girl, I woke up with you on my mind
I found your picture on my phone

I don't know what you did to me that night
I'm in the twilight zone

Tell me why I'm trippin' still thinkin' 'bout the way you move
Tell me am I crazy?
Will I ever ever find you?
Every minute I'm without you

I lose
'Cause an angel touched
My heart and took
My cool

Every second burns like fire
I'm blue

What I gon' do
'Till I find you
Gone
No trace I'm going

Sherlock Holmes
Cinderella
When the clocks go struck

It gets so hard to breathe
On my own
Girl I'm runnin' out of time

Tell me why I'm trippin'
Still thinkin' 'bout the way you move

Tell me am I crazy?

Will I ever ever find you?
Every minute
I'm without you
I lose 'cause an angel touched
My heart and took
My cool
Every second burns like fire
I'm blue
What I gon' do
'Till I find you
Wonder where
What you're doing girl
Baby I'm 'bout to lose it
I've been running
Around the world
I won't stop 'till I find ya
Wonder where
What you're doing girl
Baby I'm 'bout to lose it
I've running
Around the world
I won't stop 'till I find ya
Tell me why I'm trippin'
Tell me why I'm tripping girl
Tell me am I crazy?
Oh oh oh oh
Find you
Every minute
I'm without you
I lose
'Cause an angel touched
My heart and took
My cool
Every second burns like fire
I'm blue
What I gon' do
'Till I find you
Every minute
I'm without you
I lose
'Cause an angel touched
My heart and took
My cool
Every second burns like fire
I'm blue
What I gon' do
'Till I find you
