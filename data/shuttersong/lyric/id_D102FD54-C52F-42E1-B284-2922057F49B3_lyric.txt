Aaaahh
Aaaahahahahaaa
Aaaahh
Aaaahahahahaaa

Hey son
I'm looking forward
You're leaning backwards
Of this I'm sure

Have you had enough?
Are you feeling rough?
Does your skull hurt?
Well if it's war

Cos I am taking back what's mine
I am taking back the time
You may call it suicide
But I'm being born again
I'm waiting

Aaaahh
I'm waiting
Aaaahahahahaaa
Right here now
Aaaahh
I'm waiting
For someone
Or something
To take me
To take me over

Days
Days are forgotten
Now it's all over
Simply forgotten
How to disappear

Home bred
I've got blood lust
Feeding you bread crust
I leave no scar

You say I'm old hat
A fucking dirty rat
Call me a cliche
How right you are

Cos I am flipping bag of bones
I am righting all your wrongs
You may call it suicide
But I'm being born again
I'm waiting

Aaaahh
I'm waiting
Aaaahahahahaaa
Right here now
Aaaahh
I'm waiting
For someone
Or something
To take me
To take me over

Days
Days are forgotten
Now it's all over
Simply forgotten
How to disappear

Days
Days are forgotten
Now it's all over
Simply forgotten
How to disappear

I saw something
I get on the dark
It's the
You was at home
Chewing on monkey brains

I am out her
I'm just a sillhouette
You will never
Never ever forget

Days
Days are forgotten
Now it's all over
Simply forgotten
How to disappear

Days
Days are forgotten
Now it's all over
Simply forgotten
How to disappear

I saw something
I get on the dark
It's the
You was at home
Chewing on monkey brains
