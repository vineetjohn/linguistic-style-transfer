So what if I don't have
A lot to talk about?
I shut my mouth and keep it
Locked until it counts.
And what if I don't ever want

To leave my house?
Sit on the couch while
All my friends are going out.
(Alone), You should be alone

Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me.
We could be alone
Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too lonely.

I'll make the journey down the hall
Back to my room.
And kill more time, and let it rot
Inside it's tomb, (inside it's tomb).

See, I ain't one to climb

Some social leadder to.
Some Shangri-La
That all the cool kids will abuse.

(Alone), you should be alone
Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me.

We could be alone

Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too lonely.
(We could be alone, together).
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh.
I'm a loner, I'm in love
With you alone.
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh.
Come, be alone, and be in love
With me alone.
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh.
You should be alone
Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me.
We could be alone
Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too lonely.
You should be alone
Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me.
We could be alone
Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too lonely.
