
I wanna be a billionaire so freakin bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smilin next to Oprah and the Queen

Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights
Yeah, a different city every night oh
I swear the world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire

Yeah I would have a show like Oprah
I would be the host of, everyday Christmas
Give Artie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had it
Give away a few Mercedes like here lady have this
And last but not least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months since I've been single so
You can call me Artie Claus minus the Ho Ho
Get it, hehe, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And darn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah can't forget about me stupid
Everywhere I go Imma have my own theme music

Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights
A different city every night oh I
I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh oooh oh oooh for when I'm a Billionaire
Oh oooh oh oooh for when I'm a Billionaire

I'll be playing basketball with the President
Dunking on his delegates
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twentys, tens and bens completely separate
And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatevers left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing

I wanna be a billionaire so freaking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights
Yeah eeeh different city every night oh
I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh oooh oh oooh for when I'm a Billionaire
Oh oooh oh oooh for when I'm a Billionaire
