"Outer Space / Carry On"

[Outer Space]

I can still taste the ocean like it was today
You said please keep on holding your hands
And the rain, it came too soon, I will wait for you
To love me again

I guess I was running from something
I was running back to you
Lost here in London with nothing
I'm still running back to you
If you can love me again
I could let go of everything

If I was an island in search of castaways
Maybe I'll find you here and
The rain, it came too soon, I will wait for you
To love me again

I guess I was running from something
I was running back to you
Lost here in London with nothing
I'm still running back to you
If you can love me again
I could let go of everything

The darkest night never felt so bright with you by my side
The darkest night never felt so bright with you by my side
The darkest night never felt so bright with you by my side
The darkest night never felt so bright with you by my side
Nothing like the rain, nothing like the rain
When you're in outer space, when you're in outer space
Nothing like the rain, nothing like the rain
When you're in outer space, when you're in outer space
Nothing like the rain, nothing like the rain
When you're in outer space, when you're in outer space
Nothing like the rain, nothing like the rain
When you're in outer space, when you're in outer space
Love me like you did, love me like you did
I'll give you anything, I'll give you anything
Love me like you did, love me like you did
I'll give you anything, I'll give you anything

[Carry On]

Carry on, let the good times roll
Sail along, let your path unfold
It won't be long, won't be long, won't be long
You know it's gonna get better, you know it's gonna get better
Say a prayer for the broken bones
Cause who cares? We're all going home
And it won't be long, won't be long, won't be long
You know it's gonna get better, you know it's gonna get better

I got one foot in the golden life, one foot in the gutter
So close to the other side, so far from the wonder
I got one foot in the golden life, one foot in the gutter
So sick of the tug of war, that keeps pulling me under

Let the good times roll
Let the good times roll

Carry on, outlast the ignorance
Moving on, survive the innocence
Won't be long, won't be long, won't be long
You know it's gonna get better
