Mama always told me to be careful who I love
And daddy always told me make sure he's right
I always had my eyes on this one particular guy
I was too shy so I decided to write

I'm sending him a 4 page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss (oooohh)
And when I write him he better get it on time
I'm sending him a 4 page letter (ooh yea)
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him he better get it on time

People always say that I've played myself for you
They say that you don't even notice me (me, me, me)
Baby when I get the nerve to come to you
Promise me that you won't dis me
