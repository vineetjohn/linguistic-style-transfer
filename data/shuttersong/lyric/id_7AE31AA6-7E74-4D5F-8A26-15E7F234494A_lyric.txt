Wide eyed
Laying awake at night listening to the careful fights
Listening to my heart beat like I'm in a fight
Something's not right and I'm thinking
You can't say no if you don't know
And he can't hurt you if you don't know
And you can't say no if you don't know
And I'll be the, be the, be the one
And I'll be the, be the, be the one

So she's an old girl think about another
Just look around there's someone out there
Don't even see me cause I'm undercover
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be somebody watching over you
I'm not gonna go there
I'm not gonna go there
I'm not gonna go there
See the light but my life is on hold

Last night
I made a deal inside making sure I get fine
Making sure I keep that light in my sight
Holding me tight
And I'm thinking
You can't say no if you don't know
And he can't hurt you if you don't know
And you can't say no if you don't know
And I'll be the, be the, be the one
And I'll be the, be the, be the one

So she's an old girl think about another
Just look around there's someone out there
Don't even see me cause I'm undercover
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be somebody watching over you
I'm not gonna go there
I'm not gonna go there
I'm not gonna go there
See the light but my life is on hold

Staying undercover
Till you find me
Undercover now
And I'll be the, be the, be the one
And I'll be the, be the, be the one

So she's an old girl think about another
Just look around there's someone out there
Don't even see me cause I'm undercover
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be somebody watching over you
