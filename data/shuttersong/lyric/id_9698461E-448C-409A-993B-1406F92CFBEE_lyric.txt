Some saw the sun
Some saw the smoke
Some heard the gun
Some bent the bow

Sometimes the wire
Must tense for the note
Caught in the fire, say oh

We're about to explode
Carry your world

I'll carry your world
Carry your world
I'll carry your world
Some far away

Some search for gold
Some dragon to slay

Heaven we hope is just up the road
Show me the way Lord

'Cause I, I'm about to explode
Carry your world
I'll carry your world
Carry your world
I'll carry your world
Carry your world and all your hurt
Carry your world
