I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a lego house
When things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you
And it's dark in a cold December but I've got ya to keep me warm
And if you're broke I'll mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on
I'm out of touch I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right we can frame it and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
And I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours
I'm out of touch I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
Don't hold me down
I think my braces are breaking and it's more than I can take
And if it's dark in a cold December I've got ya to keep me warm
And if you're broke I'll mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on
I'm out of touch I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
