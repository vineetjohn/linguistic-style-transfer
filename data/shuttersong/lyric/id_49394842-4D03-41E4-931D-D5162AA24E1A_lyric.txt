Better than words
But more than a feeling (ow!)
Crazy in love
Dancing on the ceiling

Everytime we touch
I'm all shook-up
You make me wanna...
How deep is your love?
God only knows, baby

Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough, ow
There's no way I can explain your love, no

Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough, ow
I can't explain your love, no

It's better than words
Ooh oh ooh, ooh oh ooh
Better than words
Ooh ooh oh!

Better than words
You drive me crazy
Someone like you
Always be my baby

Best I ever had
Hips don't lie
You make me wanna sizzling pan noise
One more night
Irreplaceable, yeah
Crazy, we're crazy

Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough, ow
There's no way I can explain your love (there's no way I can explain your love), no

Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough, ow
I can't explain your love, no

Everyone tries (they try)
To see what it feels like (feels like)
But they'll never be right
'Cause it's better, it's better, it's better

Ooh oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
One more time
Ooh oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Better than words, oh-oh

Yeah

Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up (I don't know)
'Cause words ain't good enough, ow
There's no way I can explain your love, no
Ah, woo
Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up (sum it up)
'Cause words ain't good enough (the words ain't good enough), ow
I can't explain your love, no
It's better than words
Ooh oh ooh, ooh oh ooh
It's better than words
Ooh ooh oh!
It's better than words
Ooh oh ooh, ooh oh ooh
