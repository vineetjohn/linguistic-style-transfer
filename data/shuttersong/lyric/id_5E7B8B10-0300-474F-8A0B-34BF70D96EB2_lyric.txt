Boy you never owned it
You never had to hold it down
You could condole
Funny how we all around
Now you're sitting table
Eating all from the ground
Boy you never owned it

You know that I catch you when you take a call
Sweep up all your issues until you take control
Boy you really tame me, can no longer hold it down
When you gonna own it?

Oh boy, I'm giving you the best you'll ever see
Oh boy, I'm giving you the best you'll ever see

I'll pick you up when you are down for days
Only thing you'll break, hiding in your cave
So boy you better own it, can no longer hold it down
You should control it
Held you on my back when you were feeling down
Wanted like a seed, expecting me to grow
Tired of complaining, your turn to hold it down
I'm done explaining

Oh boy, I'm giving you the best you'll ever see
Oh boy, I'm giving you the best you'll ever see

No turning back, no
I gave up, there's no me
There's no excuses, you gotta stand for me
Just gotta own it, the best that you can be
There's no excuses, I gave the best of me

Oh boy, I'm giving you the best you'll ever see
I gave the best you'll ever see
Oh boy, I'm giving you the best you'll ever see
