We must've been together
I bet you knew just who I was
Somewhere around your second lifetime
We danced on Persian rugs
We fucked and fell in love

And that is who we are
Too familiar, so long
Energy carried on and on
Ripples in the pond
Like a mirror, so long
Energy carried on and on

Hey, I think I luh you
Fuck that, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do
I think I luh you
Fuck that, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do

Few shots, then we rid them off
Goofed off, [?] hit the loft
With the Scope on I can kill them all
We can be lovers two souls in a different life
But you know we done here been here before
How did you know we only sip clear liquor
Smoke purple endo, top floor level
Type of shit that get that shit
Flown across the pond

I think I love you ooooh
We must have been together
It's something like I thought it was
And with the last impression
You left me with an open door
I want more and more

It's who we are
Too familiar, so long
Energy carried on and on
Ripples in the pond
Like a mirror, so long
Energy carried on and on

Hey, I think I luh you
Fuck that, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do
I think I luh you
Fuck that, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do

Energy carried on and on (on and on)
Energy carried on and on (on and on)
Energy carried on and on (on and on)
Energy carried on and on (on and on)

In the night I can't quite put my finger on
We believe that we are star crossed
Forgive me if I am wrong
Forgive me if I am wrong, spinning off
Energy carried on and on

Energy carried on and on
