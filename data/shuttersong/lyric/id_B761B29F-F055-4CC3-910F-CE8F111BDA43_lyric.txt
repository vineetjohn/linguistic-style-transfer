Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we don't care
'Cause we came to have so much fun now
Bet somebody here might get some now

If you're not ready to go home
Can I get a "Hell, no! "? (Hell no)
'Cause we're gonna go all night
'Til we see the sunlight, alright

So la da di da di
We like to party
Dancing with Molly
Doing whatever we want
This is our house
This is our rules

And we can't stop
And we won't stop
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life?

And we won't stop
We run things, things don't run we
Don't take nothing from nobody

To my home girls here with the big butt
Shaking it like we at a strip club
Remember only God can judge ya
Forget the haters 'cause somebody loves ya
And everyone in line in the bathroom
Trying to get a line in the bathroom

Getting turned up, yeah, yeah, yeahhh
