People in a show
All lined in a row.
We just push on by
Its funny
How hard we try.

Take a moment to relax.
Before you do anything rash.

Don't you wanna know me?
Be a friend of mine.
I'll share some wisdom with you.
Don't you ever get lonely
From time to time?
Don't let the system get you down.

Soon our work is done
All of us one by one.
Still we live our lives
As if all this stuff survives.

Don't you wanna know me?
Be a friend of mine.
I'll share some wisdom with you.
Don't you ever get lonely
From time to time?
Don't let the system get you down.
The Linguist across the seas and the oceans

A permanent Itinerant is what I've chosen.
I find myself in Big City prison
arisen from the vision of man kind.
Designed, to keep me discreetly neatly in the corner
you'll find me with the flora and the fauna and the hardship.
Back a yard is where my heart is still
I find it hard to depart this Big City Life.
