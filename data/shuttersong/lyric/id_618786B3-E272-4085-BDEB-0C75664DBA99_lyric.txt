Waitin', watchin' the clock
It's four o'clock, it's got to stop
Tell him, take no more... she practices her speech
As he opens the door, she rolls over

Pretends to sleep as he looks her over
She lies and says she's in love with him, can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red, can't find a better man
Can't find a better man, can't find a better man

Oh

Talkin' to herself, there's no one else who needs to know

She tells herself, oh
Memories back when she was bold and strong, and waiting for the world to come along
Swears she knew it, now she swears he's gone
She lies and says she's in love with him, can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red, can't find a better man
She lies and says she still loves him, can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red, can't find a better man
Can't find a better man, can't find a better man
Yeah
She loved him, yeah, she don't want to leave this way
She feeds him, yeah, that's why she'll be back again
Can't find a better man, can't find a better man, can't find a better man, can't
find a better man
