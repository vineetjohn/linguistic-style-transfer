When I stare into your space
I look before you
And I can see you at the times


I¡¯ll be around,
to pick up your thought

Save your kaleidoscope girl
In the doorway
Just look to my world at the times

I¡¯ll be around,
to pick up your thought

Why should I turn from your face?
I¡¯m looking for you
And I still miss you at times

I¡¯ll be around,
to make up your thought
