When all the world is spinning round
Like a red balloon way up in the clouds
and my feet will not stay on the ground
You anchor me back down

I am nearly world renowned
As the restless soul who always skips town
But I look for you to come around
And anchor me back down

There are those who think that I'm strange
They would box me up, and tell me to change
But you hold me close and softly say
That you wouldn't have me any other way

When people pin me as a clown
You behave as though I'm wearing a crown

When I'm lost I feel so very found
When you anchor me back down

There are those who think that I'm strange
They would box me up, and tell me to change
But you hold me close and softly say
That you wouldn't have me any other way
When all the world is spinning round
Like a red balloon way up in the clouds
and my feet will not stay on the ground
You anchor me back down
