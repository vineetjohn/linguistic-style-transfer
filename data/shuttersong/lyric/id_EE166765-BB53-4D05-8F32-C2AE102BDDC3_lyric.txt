The kids screaming, phone ringing
Dog barking at the mailman bringing
That stack of bills overdue
Good morning baby, how are you?

Got a half hour, quick shower
Take a drink of milk but the milk's gone sour
My funny face makes you laugh
Twist the top on and I put it back

There goes the washing machine
Baby, don't kick it
I promise I'll fix it
Long about a million other things

Well, it's okay, it's so nice
It's just another day in paradise
Well, there's no place that
I'd rather be

Well, it's two hearts
And one dream
I wouldn't trade it for anything
And I ask the Lord every night
For just another day in paradise

Friday, you're late
I guess we'll never make our dinner date
At the restaurant you start to cry
Baby, we'll just improvise

Well, plan B looks like
Dominos' pizza in the candle light
Then we'll tippy toe to our room
Make a little love that's overdue

But somebody had a bad dream
Mama and daddy
Me and my teddy
Come in to sleep in between

Yeah it's okay it's so nice
It's just another day in paradise
Well, there's no place that
I'd rather be

Well, it's two hearts
And one dream
I wouldn't trade it for anything
And I ask the Lord every night
For just another day in paradise

Well, it's okay it's so nice
It's just another day in paradise
Well, there's no place that
I'd rather be

It's two hearts
And one dream
I wouldn't trade it for anything
And I ask the Lord every night
For just another day in paradise
For just another day in paradise
Well, it's the kids screaming
The phone ringing
Just another day
Well, it's Friday you're late
Oh yeah, it's just another day in paradise
