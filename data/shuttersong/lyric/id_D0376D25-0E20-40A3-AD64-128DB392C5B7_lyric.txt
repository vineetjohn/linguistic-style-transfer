So she said what's the problem baby,
What's the problem I don't know,
Well maybe I'm in love,
Think about it every time,
I think about it,

Can't stop thinking about it.
How much longer will it take to cure this,
Just to cure it 'cause I can't ignore it if it's love,
Makes me wanna turn around and face me,

But I don't know nothing 'bout love.
Come on, come on, turn a little faster,
Come on, come on, the world will follow after,

Come on, come on, because everybody's after love.
So I said I'm a snowball running,
Running down into the spring that's coming,
All this love melting under blue skies,

Belting out sunlight, shimmering love.
Well baby I surrender,
To the strawberry ice cream,
Never ever end of all this love,
Well I didn't mean to do it,

But there's no escaping your love.
These lines of lightning,
Mean we're never alone,

Never alone, no, no.
Come on, come on, move a little closer,
Come on, come on, I want to hear you whisper,

Come on, come on, settle down inside my love.
Come on, come on, jump a little higher,
Come on, come on, if you feel a little lighter,

Come on, come on, we were once upon a time in love.
We're accidentally in love,
Accidentally in love,
Accidentally in love,
Accidentally in love,
Accidentally in love,
Accidentally in love,
Accidentally in love,
Accidentally in love,

Accidentally in love,
Accidentally,
I'm in love,
I'm in love,
I'm in love,
I'm in love,
I'm in love,

I'm in love,
Accidentally,
I'm in love,
I'm in love,
I'm in love,
I'm in love,
I'm in love,
I'm in love,
Accidentally.
Come on, come on, spin a little tighter,
Come on, come on, and the world's a little brighter,
Come on, come on, just get yourself inside her love,
I'm in love.
