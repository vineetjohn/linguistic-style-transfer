I can't take them on my own, my own
Pa, I'm not the one you know, you know
I have killed a man and all I know
Is I am on the run and go.

Don't wanna call you in the nighttime
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my troubles
Don't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away
But tonight I'll need you to stay.

Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do...
I am up against the wall, the wall
Pa, I hear them coming down the hall
I have killed a man and all I know

Is I am on the run and go.
Don't wanna call you in the nighttime
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my troubles
Don't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away

But tonight I'll need you to stay.

Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do...
Cold nights under siege from accusations

Cerebral thunder in one-way conversations
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh.
Don't wanna call you in the nighttime
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my troubles
Don't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away
But tonight I'll need you to stay.
Tonight I'll need you to stay!
