"Girls"

Bite your face to spite your nose
17 and a half years old
Worrying about my brother finding out
What's the fun in doing what you're told?

I said, "No!"
"Oh give it a rest, I could persuade you"
"I'm not your typical, stoned 18 year old
Give me a night I'll make you"
"I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age, but girl I'm not your savior."
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now because

They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's 17
They're just girls
They're just girls

A pair of frozen hands to hold,
Oh she's so southern so she feels the cold,
One moment I was tearing off your blouse,
Now you're living in my house.
What happened to just messing around?

I said, "Yo, I think you better go; I can't take you."
"You just sit and get stoned with 30 year olds and you think you've made it."
"Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age instead of making changes?"
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now because

They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's 17
They're just girls
They're just girls

I told her from the start
Destined to be hard
I told her from the start
I'll break your heart
Destined to be hard
I'll break your heart

I said, "Yo, I think you better go; I can't take you."
"I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age, but girl I'm not your savior."
"Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age instead of making changes?"
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now because

They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's 17
They're just girls
They're just girls

They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's 17
They're just girls
They're just girls

'Cause they're just girls...
Just girls, they're just girls...
