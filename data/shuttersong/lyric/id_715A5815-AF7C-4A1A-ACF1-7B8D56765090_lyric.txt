I left my girl back home
I don't love her no more
And she'll never fucking know that
These fucking eyes that I'm staring at
Let me see that ass

Look at all this cash
And I emptied out my cards to her
Now I'm fucking leaning on that
Bring your love baby I could bring my shame
Bring the drugs baby I could bring my pain

I got my heart right here
I got my scars right here

Bring the cups baby I could bring the drank
Bring your body baby I could bring you fame
And that's my motherfucking words too
Just let me motherfucking love you

Listen ma I'll give you all I got
Get me off of this
I need confidence in myself
Listen ma I'll give you all of me
Give me all of it
I need all of it to myself
So tell me you love me
Only for tonight
only for one night,
even though you don't love me
just tell me you love me,

I'll give you what I need
I'll give you all of me
Even though you don't love me
Let me see you dance
I love to watch you dance

Take you down another level
And get you dancing with the devil
Take a shot of this
But I'm warning you
I'm on that shit that you can't smell baby

So put down your perfume
Bring your love baby I could bring my shame

Bring the drugs baby I could bring my pain
I got my heart right here
I got my scars right here
Bring the cups baby I could bring the drank
Bring your body baby I could bring you fame
And that's my motherfucking word too
So let me motherfucking love you
Listen ma I'll give you all I got
Get me off of this
I need confidence in myself
Listen ma I'll give you all of me
Give me all of it
I need all of it to myself
So tell me you love me
Only for tonight
Only for one night
Even though you don't love me
Just tell me you love me
I'll give you what I need
I'll give you all of me
Even though you don't love me
