Thought it'd be easy
Now its getting critical
You're out of my life now
Its unbelievable
The more things change they stay the same

Thought I could take it
But I am unable
It is too much to handle
It isn't over until its over

Got the heart of an ox
Got the skin of a dragon
I'm a fighter, always standing up
Now the weakness talks
I'm on my knees, and I'm about to drop

Its a mystery
Why I cant stop thinking of you
Mystery
How everything circles around you
In my mind
I'm doing all in my power
To get free
In my mind

I promised myself till this day I'd be
But its a mystery

Can feel your presence
Can smell your fragrance
As if you stood beside me
It isn't over until it's over

I'm not gonna cry

I've been thought better than that
My eyes are too fucking dry
Now Isn't that ironic?
This is my own fight
I'm gonna wear it out
I'm gonna bleed it out

Its a mystery
Why I cant stop thinking of you
Mystery
How everything circles around you
In my mind
I'm doing all in my power
To get free
In my mind

I promised myself till this day I'd be
But its a mystery

Now it's critical
Now it's critical
It's unbelievable
It's unbelievable
It's unbelievable
It's unbelievable

Its a mystery
Why I cant stop thinking

Its a mystery
How everything circles around you
In my mind
I'm doing all in my power
To get free
In my mind

I promised myself till this day I'd be
But its a mystery
