It's inevitable everything
That's good comes to an end
It's impossible to know
If after this we can still be friends, yeah

I know you're saying you don't wanna hurt me
Well, maybe you should show a little mercy
The way you look I know you didn't come to apologize

Hey, hey, hey
Oh, why you're wearing that to walk out of my life?
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, even though it's over you should stay tonight

Hey, hey, hey
If tomorrow you won't be mine
Won't you give it to me one last time?
Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye

Unforgettable together
Held the whole world in our hands
Unexplainable
The love that only we could understand, yeah

I know there's nothing I can do to change it
But is there something that can be negotiated?
My heart's already breaking, baby, go on, twist the knife

Hey, hey, hey
Oh, why you're wearing that to walk out of my life?
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, even though it's over you should stay tonight

Hey, hey, hey
If tomorrow you won't be mine
Won't you give it to me one last time?
Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye
Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye

One more taste of your lips just to bring me back
To the places we've been and the nights we've had
Because if this is it then at least we could end it right

Oh, why you're wearing that to walk out of my life?
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, even though it's over you should stay tonight, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
If tomorrow you won't be mine
Won't you give it to me one last time?
Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye
Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye
Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye
