We know full well there's just time
So is it wrong to dance this line?
If your heart was full of love
Could you give it up?

'Cause what about, what about angels
They will come, they will go and make us special
Don't give me up
Don't give me up

How unfair it's just our luck
Found something real that's out of touch
But if you'd searched the whole wide world
Would you dare to let it go?

'Cause what about, what about angels
They will come, they will go, make us special
Don't give me up
Don't give me up

'Cause what about, what about angels
They will come, they will go and make us special
It's not about, not about angels
Angels
