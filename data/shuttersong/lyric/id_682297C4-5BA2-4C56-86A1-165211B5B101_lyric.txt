Don't stop me just give me more
You're what I want for sure
Don't stop I just want you more
Babe you are my only cure
Don't stop until I make you mine
You can take all my time
Don't stop I feel so alive
Baby you blow my mind

Why stop when there's so much more
Baby just show me how to
Look I'll give you so much more
All that you have is lining
Look never felt this before
Baby I thought you want it
Everybody knows, body-knows, body-knows

If we could all fall in love together
If we could all fall in love together
If we could all fall in love together
We'd have no enemies, we'd have no enemies
If we could all fall in love together
If we could all fall in love together
If we could all fall in love together
We'd have no enemies, we'd have no enemies
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh

Lights up, let me take you down
That's what I want right now
Free-styling make me go wild
Baby just turn me around
All that I can say for you
Show me what you can do
Don't stop me I can't refuse
Take me the whole way through

Why stop when there's so much more
Baby just show me how to
Look I'll give you so much more
All that you have is lining
Look never felt this before
Baby I thought you want it
Everybody knows, body-knows, body-knows

If we could all fall in love together
If we could all fall in love together
If we could all fall in love together
We'd have no enemies, we'd have no enemies
If we could all fall in love together
If we could all fall in love together
If we could all fall in love together
We'd have no enemies, we'd have no enemies
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh
