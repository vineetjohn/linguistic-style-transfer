I am just crushed in the velvet 
My heart is locked in a box 
I am still sinking in black skylines 
But now I want it to stop 

I’m sailing high but I can’t see 
I’ve been pushed around, up and down in a cloud 
And I can’t breathe 
I’m falling down, down to my knees 
You’ve gotta let me go, you’ve gotta help me out 
You’ve gotta set me free 

You’ve gotta set me free 
You devoured my soul 
‘Cause I can taste your lips on my lips 
Your kisses make me out of control 
And I can feel my blood 
It’s crawling through my veins 
And you close your eyes and you twist your smile 
‘Cause you can feel my pain 

You can feel my pain 
You can feel my pain 

I have been dancing with shadows 
I have been calling your name 
I feel the skin dripping from my bones 
Your touch, it makes me insane 

I’m sailing high but I can’t see 
I’ve been pushed around, up and down in a cloud 
And I can’t breathe 
I’m falling down, down to my knees 
You’ve gotta let me go, you’ve gotta help me out 
You’ve gotta set me free 

You’ve gotta set me free 
You devoured my soul 
‘Cause I can taste your lips on my lips 
Your kisses make me out of control 
And I can feel my blood 
It’s crawling through my veins 
And you close your eyes and you twist your smile 
‘Cause you can feel my pain 

I can’t do this no more 
You’re tearing me apart 
So give me one last kiss 
And then I have to let you know 

You’ve gotta set me free 
You devoured my soul 
‘Cause I can taste your lips on my lips 
Your kisses make me out of control 
And I can feel my blood 
It’s crawling through my veins 
And you close your eyes and you twist your smile 
‘Cause you can feel my pain 

You can feel my pain 
You can feel my pain 
You can feel my pain 
You can feel my pain
