So you say you wanna get away
We don't need a plane
I could be your escape
Take you to a place
Where there's no time, no space
I could be your private island
On a different planet
Anything could happen
Listen to the waves
Let them wash away your pain

[Chorus:]
I could be your fantasy
I could be your fantasy
Underneath the palm trees
You could leave your worries
Listen to the waves
Say you wanna get so high?
Breathe me in like air tonight
Listen to the waves
I could be your fantasy

So you say you wanna get so high?
Breathe me in like air tonight
Let yourself unwind, get lost
In the garden of my mind
I could be your private island
Underneath the palm trees
You could leave your worries
Listen to the waves
Let them wash away your pain

[Chorus:]
I could be your fantasy
I could be your fantasy
Underneath the palm trees
You could leave your worries
Listen to the waves
Say you wanna get so high?
Breathe me in like air tonight
Listen to the waves
