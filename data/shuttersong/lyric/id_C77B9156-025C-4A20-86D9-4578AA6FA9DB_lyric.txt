 You're smile is on every face now
But  every time  you wake up
 You 're hearing me say
Goodbye
.
Baby,  you don't have to worry
I'll be coming back for  you, back for  you, back for  you,  you
Lately, I've been going crazy
So I'm coming back for  you, back for  you, back for  you,  you.
.
I've never been so into somebody before
And  every time we both touch I only want more
So tell me nothing 's going to change yeah
And  you won't ever walk away yeah
Cause even though  every night  you'll know what I'll say
Goodbye.
