I get caught in the water
I get torn in the wind
I could drown in the river
While the sun burns dim

I get tossed by the ocean
Fall deep in the sand
I'm drowned out by the thunder
Lost in the land

Is anyone listening
Is anyone around to see?

That I'm doing it all for you
I'm doing it all for you
I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go
I'm doing it all for you
I'm doing it all for you
I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go

Ooh...
Ooh...

25 seconds, your heart will stop resting
Your body start shaking
Your mind is now ready to go
Ready to go

25 seconds, your heart will stop resting
Your body start shaking
Your mind now ready to go
Ready to go!...

I said, 25 seconds, your heart will stop resting!
Your body start shaking!
Your mind now ready to go!
Ready to go!
