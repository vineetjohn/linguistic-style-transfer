What you wanna do baby?
Where you wanna go?
I'll take you to the moon baby
I'll take you to the floor
I'll treat you like a real lady
No matter where you go
Just give me some time baby
As you know
Even when we're apart I know my heart is still beat with you
Five more hours till the night is ours, and I'm in bed with you

This right here is my time for party
Five more hours we're just getting started
This right here is my time for party
Five more hours we're just getting started

(Five more hours we're just getting started)

How you wanna feel baby? What you wanna know?
Just pour another drink baby, come on pour a little more
I'll treat you like a real lady, I'll keep you out the cold
I'll give you all my time baby, you know Even when we're apart I know my heart is still beat with you
Five more hours till the night is ours, and I'm in bed with you
This right here is my time for party
Five more hours we're just getting started
This right here is my time for party
Five more hours we're just getting started
I follow the sound of your heartbeat

How it always calls me, finding my way back to you
I'm feeling it more now than ever
I'll do this forever, just to spend a night with you
This right here is my time for party
Five more hours we're just getting started
This right here is my time for party
Five more hours we're just getting started
(Five more hours we're just getting started)
