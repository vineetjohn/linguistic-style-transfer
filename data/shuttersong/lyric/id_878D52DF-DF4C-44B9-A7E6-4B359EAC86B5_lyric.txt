We should take a walk someday
Dream about what we could've been
But I don't wanna leave this place
No faith in Brooklyn
(Yeah)
If I move out one day
It will make me a better man
(What up Jhameel)
But I don't wanna leave this place
(It's hoodie)
No faith in Brooklyn

I said I'm so gone, oh my god, where the menu?
Order me all your sushi for them bitches at the venue
Stop, drop, roll, continue
Cause haters try to mingle, and I'm just tryin' to sing you a song
Tell ya that I'm leavin' but I won't be long
If it was up to me I would see ya tomarr
But talk's cheap so I'm payin' up
New kicks be the only way I'm layin' up
So maybe I won't make it as an athlete
But that don't mean I'll let the competition pass me
I money ball, Billy Beane and some skinny jeans
And the whole damn team just some mini me's
Cause they ain't seen another kid like this
It's on your mind baby you should probably write this
I told her I can dance good for a white kid

So turn around, show me everything I might miss

We should take a walk someday
Dream about what we could've been
But I don't wanna leave this place
No faith in Brooklyn
If I move out one day
It will make me a better man

But I don't wanna leave this place
No faith in Brooklyn

I said repetition-repe-repetition like a muscle man
You just wanna tie me up, snap me like a rubber band
It's 2012 so now they wanna ask me what's the plan
I tell 'em never trust a man unless he Russell Brands
Pass me on that Absinthe now watch me change my accent
I got girls in the back on a mattress
You got girls on the map like that's it
They wanna know, am I Jay Sean or Raekwon
Good sean, or great Sean
Stay long Kreayshawn
Now, either way, they try to cipher your dreams
I tell 'em keep your eyes open, you won't like what you see
They be here for a minute, now they gone in a week
You tryna Dante the peak, I'm tryna Andre the beat
Lord, can you tell me where my faith is

I graduated and I still ain't made the A-List
Ain't a problem if you tell me how you feel girl
I know the road rules but you need the Real World

We should take a walk someday
Dream about what we could've been
But I don't wanna leave this place
No faith in Brooklyn

If I move out one day
It will make me a better man
But I don't wanna leave this place
No faith in Brooklyn

I said ooh, girl, turn around
Tell me where we're goin' now
Ooh, girl, take it back
I don't want to end like that

I'm all over the world

I'm all over the world
And come back to Brooklyn
(We should take a walk someday)
And come back to Brooklyn
(We should take a walk someday)
And comeback to Brooklyn

We should take a walk someday
Dream about what we could've been
But I don't wanna leave this place
No faith in Brooklyn
If I move out one day
It will make me a better man
But I don't wanna leave this place
No faith in Brooklyn
