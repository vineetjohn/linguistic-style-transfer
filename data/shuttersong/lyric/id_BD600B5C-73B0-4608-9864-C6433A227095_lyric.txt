The  Lazy  Song - Bruno Mars
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone 
So leave a message after tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
I'm gonna kick my feet up then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on  throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gon' tell me I can't
I'll be lounging on the couch just chilling in my Snuggie
Click to MTV so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freaking man
Oh yes  I said it I said it
I said it 'cause I can
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone 
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
Nothing at all  (woo hoo) (woohoo) (hooooo) nothing at all
Tomorrow I'll wake up  do some P90X
Find a really nice girl  have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out
This is great
(Oh my god  this is great)
Yeah  I might mess around
And get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry paps  you'll just have to wait
Oh yes  I said it  I said it
I said it 'cause I can
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone 
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
No  I ain't gonna comb my hair
'Cause I ain't going anywhere
No  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  no
I'll just strut in my birthday suit
And let everything hang loose
Yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah
Yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah
Oh  today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone  so leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
Nothing at all
Woohoo woohoo oooo
Nothing at all
Woohoo woohoo oooo
Nothing at all
