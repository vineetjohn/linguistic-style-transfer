Like an astronaut that's scared of heights
With a heart that's beating at the speed of light
You've been waiting for this feeling all your life

Sometimes it's just hard to realize
When you're stuck in a moment
And your spark has been stolen
This is our time to own it
So own it

Baby we were born with
Fire n gold in our eyes, eyes
With fire n gold in our eyes, eyes
Got lightning in a bottle
Hands on the throttle
Even in the dust we shine
With fire n gold in our eyes

There is something different about you and I (about you and I)
And I feel like I have known you my whole life
There is beauty behind every tear you've cried

Sometimes it's just hard to realize
When you're stuck in a moment
And your spark has been stolen
This is our time to own it
So own it

Baby we were born with
Fire n gold in our eyes, eyes
With fire n gold in our eyes, eyes
Got lightning in a bottle
Hands on the throttle
Even in the dust we shine
With fire n gold in our eyes

There is love inside this madness
We are walking on the moon
Though I don't believe in magic
I believe in me and you
I believe in me and you
I believe in me and you

Baby we were born with
Fire n gold in our eyes, eyes
With fire n gold in our eyes, eyes
Got lightning in a bottle
Hands on the throttle
Even in the dust we shine
With fire n gold in our eyes, yeah yeah, yeahhh, whoooo
