"I Can Only Imagine"
(feat. Chris Brown & Lil Wayne)

[Chris Brown:]
Where you been? Where you been all my life?
Baby, it's a sin, the way you look in the light
It's obvious that I want something from you
You know what, what I wanna do, do, do

If we touched it would bring me to life
I could only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
Oh, every time,
It would bring me to life
I could only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
What it'd be like,
What it'd be like, like, like
What it'd be like, like, like...

[Lil Wayne:]
I saw you from afar
Thought I'd say, "What's up?"
You can tell me your name, when we waking up
They call me Tunechi, I'm good, I'm Gucci
Now you can kiss your old dude goodbye: smooches
You're a beast, yo-you're a beauty
Man, I think somebody did gave Cupid an Uzi -- shoot me
You're a firework, brighter in the dark
So let's turn off the lights and give me that spark

If we touched it would bring me to life
I could only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
Oh, every time
It would bring me to life
I could only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
What it'd be like
What it'd be like, like, like
What it'd be like, like, like

I want to let her touch me
One touch will feel free (it would bring me to life)
I want to feel free (she can kiss me)
So I can finally be
So I can finally be (girl)
So I can finally see (yeah! kiss me now)
So I can finally see (kiss me now)

(what, what, what...)
