OOGIE BOOGIE:
Well, well, well, what have we here?
Sandy Claws, huh?
Oh, I'm really scared
So you're the one everybody's talkin' about, ha, ha

You're jokin', you're jokin'
I can't believe my eyes
You're jokin' me, you gotta be
This can't be the right guy
He's ancient, he's ugly
I don't know which is worse
I might just split a seam now
If I don't die laughing first

When Mr. Oogie Boogie says
There's trouble close at hand
You'd better pay attention now
'Cause I'm the Boogie Man
And if you aren't shakin'
Then there's something very wrong
'Cause this may be the last time now
That you hear the boogie song, ohhh

THREE BATS:
Ohhh

OOGIE BOOGIE:
Ohhh

SEVEN LIZARDS:
Ohhh

OOGIE BOOGIE:
Ohhh

SEVEN LIZARDS:
Ohhh, he's the Oogie Boogie Man

OOGIE BOOGIE:
Well if I'm feelin' antsy
And there's nothin' much to do
I might just cook a special batch
Of snake and spider stew
And don't ya know the one thing
That would make it work so nice?
A roly-poly Sandy Claws to add a little spice

THREE SKELETONS:
Ohhh

OOGIE BOOGIE:
Oh, yeah

Ohhh

OOGIE BOOGIE:
Ohhh

THREE BATS:
Ohhh

OOGIE BOOGIE AND THREE SKELETONS:
Oh, yeah, I'm (he's) the Oogie Boogie Man

SANTA:
Release me now
Or you must face the dire consequences
The children are expecting me
So please, come to your senses

OOGIE BOOGIE:
You're jokin', you're jokin'
I can't believe my ears
Would someone shut this fella up
I'm drownin' in my tears
It's funny, I'm laughing
You really are too much
And now, with your permission
I'm going to do my stuff

SANTA:
What are you going to do?

OOGIE BOOGIE:
I'm gonna do the best I can

Oh, the sound of rollin' dice
To me is music in the air
'Cause I'm a gamblin' Boogie Man
Although I don't play fair

It's much more fun, I must confess
When lives are on the line
Not mine, of course, but yours, old boy
Now that'd be just fine

SANTA:
Release me fast or you will have to
Answer for this heinous act

OOGIE BOOGIE:
Oh, brother, you're something
You put me in a spin
You aren't comprehending
The position that you're in
It's hopeless, you're finished
You haven't got a prayer
'Cause I'm Mr. Oogie Boogie
And you ain't going nowhere
