I know that my love for you is real
It's somethin' true
That we do
Just somethin' natural
That I feel
When you walk in the room
When you're near
I feel my heart skip a beat
The whole world disappears
And there's just you and me
Falling head over feet
Let's take a chance, together
()
I know, I know, I know, I know
we gonna make it
'Cause no one else can
make me feel the way that you do
I promise you
I know, I know, I know, I know
we gonna get there
Today, tomorrow
And forever we will stay true
I Promise you
They say
that we're just too young to know
But I'm sure heart and soul
that i am never letting you go
When it's right, it's right
And this is it
'Cause I'm walking on air
every single time that we kiss
You make the angels sing
You give that songbird wings
You make everything better
()
I know, I know, I know, I know
we're gonna make it
'Cause no one else can
make me feel the way that you do
I promise you
I know, I know, I know, I know
we're gonna get there
Today, tomorrow
And forever we will stay true
I Promise you
I'll never let you down
I'll always hear you out
There is nothing you cannot confide
You listen when I speak
You make my knees go weak
And I just want you by side
()
I know, I know, I know, I know
we're gonna make it
'Cause no one else can
make me feel the way that you do
I promise you
I know, I know, I know, I know
we're gonna get there
Today, tomorrow
And forever we will stay true
I Promise you
We're gonna make
I promise you, yeah, yeah, yeah
I promise you
I promise you
I promise you
