The world was on fire and no-one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I'd never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
And I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you

No, I don't wanna fall in love

(This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
With you

With you
What a wicked game to play, to make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way

What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you
And I don't wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)

With you
The world was on fire, no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I'd never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you

And I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you
No, I don't wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
With you
(this world is only gonna break your heart)
With you
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I...
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
Nobody loves no one
