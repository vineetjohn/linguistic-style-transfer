These bitches act local and think global
Never seen a 100 thousand, well let me show you
What you want to drink, I know you hate being sober
And I know all these niggas hate Chief Sosa
I'm cruising in my 'Rari with my Louis loafers
Bitch I'm a Rastafari, I'm a toolie toter
Wish a nigga would try to screw me over
Now I got blood on my Louie loafers
I wear thousand dollar belts cause I'mma rich nigga
Nina like a boxer bitch the way she hit niggas
Shoes cost a bunch of shit, look at my kicks nigga
Could of bought a ass for my bitch nigga
I'm off this Activis, it got me leanin' over
I poured up 4 of Purp in some Peach soda
Yo boyfriend an opp, I'll make Nina blow him
You was on the phone with him, sucking my dick, he ain't even know it
I ain't even try to
You wanna Glo up, baby Keef got you
You's a gold bottle, these hoes pink Moscato
Baby I'm the owner, you can be my castle
Baby cause I like you
Only reason I text you and why I Skype you
I just wanna fuck on you, I don't wanna wife you
But you gotta brush your teeth and do what I say do
Bitch can you hear me?
Keep your pussy in park, no 360
That boy said he getting gwuap, no he didn't
I'm Almighty Sosa his complete mission
I'm nowhere around you
I'm high off this earth, I can't come back down to
Baby this is a song, I just thought I tell you
I would send you off but I don't wanna mail you
I don't wanna smell you
Cause I'ma cut you off, quicker than I met you
I'ma swipe your name up off my schedule
And if smoke this blunt, girl, I'm gone forget you
I ain't even playing though
I make bitches fly like Peter Pan do
That's why I just ask you
You's a alcoholic, I ain't got no time for you
Is you off the molly
If I book your flight, is you gonna top me
Okay you got me
I don't love no thotties
