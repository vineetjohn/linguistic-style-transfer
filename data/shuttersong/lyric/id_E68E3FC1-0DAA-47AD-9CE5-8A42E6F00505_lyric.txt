Two Weeks - All That Remains
And you neglected I called you out
Don't please
I said we're stronger than this now
You resurrected mistakes
Years past it seemed
And they exist to still haunt you
And still you feel like the loneliness
Is better replaced by this
I don't believe it this way
And I can see the fear in your eyes
I've seen it materialize
Growing stronger each day
I could see it as you turned to stone
Still clearly I can hear you say
Don't leave  don't give up on me
Two weeks and you ran away
I remember don't lie to me
You couldn't see that it was not that way
Swear I never gave up on you
I wanted nothing but for that trust again
And brick by brick you would take it
You feared of phantoms and none exist but you
You still saw fit to destroy it
And still you feel like the loneliness
Is better replaced by this
I don't believe it this way
And I can see the fear in your eyes
I've seen it materialize
Growing stronger each day
I could see it as you turned to stone
Still clearly I can hear you say
Don't leave don't give up on me
Two weeks and you ran away
I remember don't lie to me
You couldn't see that it was not that way
Swear I never gave up on you
And you neglected I called you out don't please
I said we're stronger than this now
You feared of phantoms and none exist but you
You still saw fit to destroy it
And I can see the fear in your eyes
I've seen it materialize
Growing stronger each day
I could see it as you turned to stone
Still clearly I can hear you say
Don't leave don't give up on me
Two weeks you ran away
I could see it as you turned to stone
Still clearly I can hear you say
Don't leave don't give up on me
Two weeks and you ran away
I remember don't lie to me
You couldn't see that it was not that way
Swear I never gave up on you
I could see it as you turned to stone
Still clearly I can hear you say
Don't leave don't give up on me
Two weeks and you ran away
I remember don't lie to me
You couldn't see that it was not that way
Swear I never gave up on you
