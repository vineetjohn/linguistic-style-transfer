I've got a black ski mask, but I don't ski
But I snowboard, dash an MC off-piste
If one of you try and violate me

You get a punch in the face with my front door key
Punch in the neck with my back door key
Box in the mout with my X6 key
Box in the eye with the fob
I use to log into my HSBC
Talk about banks, kill em with Ps
Run up in your girl's house with two of my Gs
Get the money out, put the money in his mout
Then suffocate man with about two Gs
Suffocate man with about four Gs
Suffocate man, then I might just breathe
I'll bury man two foot shallow
Ain't got time to dig six feet deep
These MCs and rappers wanna chat 'bout their syllables
And their multis and their similes
All that shit, then I come through with my ABC
Girls and man are like "Jme's deep"
Bare pictures when they see me on street
Old school rudeboy like Crazy T
All you man don't want it with me
I'm a bad rudeboy, badboy MC
Say my name, Jme
Nostradamus couldn't see me
Expelliarmus couldn't stop me
How could a man with a uni degree
Be bussing up mic and chatting his greaze?
Cause the music originated
And will always remain in the streets

What about?
Man don't care 'bout all that
You got it now?
Man don't care 'bout all that
Who's not allowed?
Man don't care 'bout all that
Knock him out
Man don't care 'bout all that
What about?
Man don't care about all that
Just drop him out
Man don't care about all that
I'll just crop him out
Man don't care about all that
He's forgotten 'bout
Cause man don't care about all that

Cause I'm the most immediate, he's just an old school idiot
Been doing local things but we be the local geezers
Just look at my list of friends as he holds em up with tweezers
Yeah, man used to move that white, yeah, we be them old school dealers
She's lighting up some sense, he's lighting up Amnesias
I'm 'bout to get it started, I'm 'bout to get amnesia'd
Man might have to move up Velma, might have to touch Louise's
Cause at the top it's just us, yeah, man had to quote no reeses
I'm like Batman, doing it, doing it, doing it hardest
Just let me confirm it, loafers
Just have to be Herm¨¨s, burners went back and hit Bernard
Furnace, I'm back with big burners
That's my spot, I'm back with that permit
Pulled that pistol back and then burn it
Friday shit, I'm back and big worm it
Excuse me? What? Pardon?
I had to just ask em
Iron Man, the MAC'll just Stark em
Man's like buu, I'm back with that margin
Like Adam and Eve, I'm back in that garden
What a bloodclart, I'm back, the don gorgon
Started off light, I think, and then darkened
Hollowman, Jme and I'm talking
Kill em a-d, kill an MC
Digestives, cinnamon tea
Ain't no filling them shoes, cause they still on his feet
Man's down south hustling with no gold grill in his teeth

What about?
Man don't care 'bout all that
You got it now?
Man don't care 'bout all that
Who's not allowed?
Man don't care 'bout all that
Knock him out
Man don't care 'bout all that
What about?
Man don't care about all that
Just drop him out
Man don't care about all that
I'll just crop him out
Man don't care about all that
He's forgotten 'bout
Cause man don't care about all that
