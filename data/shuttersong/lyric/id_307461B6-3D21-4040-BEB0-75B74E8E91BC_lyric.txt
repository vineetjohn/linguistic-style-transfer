See where he brought you from
How many of you know?

Now I was in a real bad abusive relationship
Knowing that, that was no way for me to live
A young girl like me, raised up in a good family
Way too young to endure such misery
And every night I cry myself to sleep from all the pain
And the more I prayed for sunny days it seemed to rain
(He hit me) at any given time
(He hit me) no reason at all
(He hit me) so so hard
(He hit me) my God, sometimes I'd fall
Mama asked what happened to me
And I'd take up for him
She said that devil's a liar
And pray get rid of him
And now I'm going to school
Hitting those books
I'm doing fine
He's out my life
I'm not confused
Got peace of mind
Man I tell you

Prayer changes (it changes)
Prayer changes (oh it changes)
Prayer changes (I'm a witness that)
Prayer changes things (said I know)
Prayer changes (it changes)
Prayer changes (it changes)

I was a freshman in college and uh
I had just made it on the basketball team
I had all the skills it took to make it
But on my grades I would get nothing but all D's
And the coach came to me
And had a talk with me about my career
Said if you don't get your grades up
I'm gonna have to sit you down this year
Man as tough as I was I broke down and cried
'Cause everybody knows me
Knows that basketball is my life
(Algebra) I studied hard
(Chemistry) I gave my all
(Calculus) oh my God
(English) so many flaws
Playing ball didn't look to good for me
My future, could not see
I had lost all my beliefs
And gave up on all my dreams
Then I went to church on Sunday
And the pastor began to preach
It was like he was talking to me
When he said I can do all things
In Christ that strengthens me
And for me that was enough
Now that I went from a D
All the way to an A plus
I tell you prayer changes things

Prayer changes (prayer)
Prayer changes (it changes things)
Prayer changes things (oh)
Prayer changes (said it changes)
Prayer changes (things)

Me and my wife had a few problems
We thought that nothing could solve them
Listening to family members and so called friends
Man I tell you that's just how the devil creeps in
We were separated at least for a month or two
She was wilding in the clubs
And I was out there doing wrong too
And we would walk around the house
Putting each other down
I mean right in front of the kids
We would curse each other out
Then I was in a bad accident
And almost lost my life
And guess who was there for me
My wife
Now ain't it funny how He makes a way
When we said there was no way
I'm out the hospital and back at home
Planning another wedding day, I tell you

Now all of these things were happening in one family
But that's okay, cause there's nothing God can't achieve
I don't care what the problem in your life may be
Cause who the Son sets free, is free indeed
And if you didn't know, now you should know
All you have to do is take this family life for example
Now Mom and Dad are married again
Four kids now, cause they just had twins
Little sister all grown up now
She's a lawyer, married with one child now
Two years, big brother's out of college
And man he's got his hands full
Blessed with skills, blessed with knowledge
Now he's playing for the Chicago Bulls
