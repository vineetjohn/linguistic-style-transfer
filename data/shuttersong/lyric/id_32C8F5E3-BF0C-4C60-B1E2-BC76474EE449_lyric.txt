You don't need a lot of money, and you don't have to play no games
All I need is all your lovin' to get the blood rushing through my veins...
I wanna say we're going steady like it's 1954
Now, it doesn't have to be forever

Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Oh...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Ooh, oh...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart, sha-la...) Whoa-oh-oh, yeah...

You don't need to worry about makin' me crazy, 'cause I'm way past that
So just call me if you want me, 'cause you got me, and I'll show you
How much I wanna be on your tattooed heart...

(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Oh, oh...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Oh, oh...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart, sha-la...) Just as long as I'm the name on your
tattooed heart...
Wrap me in your jacket, my baby, and lay me in your bed

And kiss me underneath the moonlight
Darlin', let me trace the lines on your tattooed heart...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Oh, oh...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Oh, oh, babe...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart, sha-la...) Just as long as I'm the name on your
tattooed heart...
