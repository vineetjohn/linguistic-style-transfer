Just got cheated on, no it's not my day

That's not my b*tch, she's not my girl, she's not my babe

My stomach's in pain

I hope I don't throw up all over what you told

But it hurts oh no no

I can't even, I can't even believe what you did to me

You can't even, you can't even say I'm overreacting

I can't even, can't even hear your side

Shame on me, you fooled me twice

And you said I wasn't just like anyone, like

But you treated me just like everyone, like everyone else

You like to say that you're right

Did it make you feel bad

When you cheated on your man last night

Did I even ever cross your mind

You like to say that you're right

Did it make you feel bad

When you cheated on your man last night

Did I even ever cross your mind

You like to say that you're right

You like to say that you're right

Drop head with a time hoodie on me

Bought a hundred chains now the b*tches all linger

Walk by the crib, smell the kitchen all stanky

Floor seats, 4 quarter, spent a quarter on the link

Ridin' through Philly, Meek Milly never lost

Still ridin' through the strip catchin' licks with my dog

30 for the whole, 15 for the half

You could break it down, come and see me with the bag

Shorty fell in love with a young rich n*gga

Blunt full of smoke and a cup full of liquor

Say what I mean and I mean what I said baby

Silk sheets, I be slippin' off the bed baby

I can't even, I can't even believe what you did to me

You can't even, you can't even say I'm overreacting

I can't even, can't even hear your side

Shame on me, you fooled me twice

 

And you said I wasn't just like anyone, like

But you treated me just like everyone, like everyone else

You like to say that you're right

Did it make you feel bad

When you cheated on your man last night

Did I even ever cross your mind

You like to say that you're right
