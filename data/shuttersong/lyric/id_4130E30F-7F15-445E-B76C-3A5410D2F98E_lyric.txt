I... I...I... I...
Erotic City
Erotic City

All of my purple life
I've been looking for a dame
That would wanna be my wife
That was my intention, babe

If we cannot make babies,
maybe we can make some time
Thoughts of pretty u and me,
Erotic City come alive
We can funk until the dawn,
making love 'til cherry's gone
Erotic City can't u see,
thoughts of pretty u and me

Everytime I comb my hair
Thoughts of u get in my eyes
U're a sinner, I don't care
I just want your creamy thighs

If we cannot make babies,
maybe we can make some time
Thoughts of pretty u and me,
Erotic City come alive
We can funk until the dawn,
making love 'til cherry's gone
Erotic City can't u see,
thoughts of pretty u and me

All of my hang-ups r gone
How I wish u felt the same
We can funk until the dawn
('Til the dawn) (Until the dawn)
How I wish u were my dame
(Baby won't u call my name)


If we cannot make babies,
maybe we can make some time
Thoughts of pretty u and me,
Erotic City come alive
We can funk until the dawn,
making love 'til cherry's gone
Erotic City can't u see,
thoughts of pretty u and me

Baby, u're so creamy

If we cannot make babies,
maybe we can make some time
Thoughts of pretty u and me,
Erotic City come alive
We can funk until the dawn,
making love 'til cherry's gone ('Til the dawn)
Erotic City can't u see,
thoughts of pretty u and me

If we cannot make babies,
maybe we can make some time (U and me)
Some time, some time, some time, Erotic City
If we cannot make babies,
maybe we can make some time
Thoughts of pretty u and me,
Erotic City come alive

We can funk until the dawn,
making love 'til cherry's gone (Come alive)
Erotic City can't u see,
thoughts of pretty u and me
We can funk until the dawn,
making love 'til cherry's gone
