Hey! Hey!
That's what I like about you

You keep me warm at night
Tell me I'm the only one
Wanna come over tonight?
Yeah
Keep on whispering in my ear

Tell me all the things that I wanna hear
'Cause it's true, that's what I like about you

You really know how to dance
When you go up, down, jump around
Think about true romance, yeah
Keep on whispering in my ear

Tell me all the things that I wanna hear
'Cause it's true, that's what I like about you
That's what I like about you
