Found myself today
Singing out loud your name,
You said I'm crazy,
If I am I'm crazy for you.

Sometimes sitting in the dark
Wishing you were here
Turns me crazy,
But it's you who makes me lose my head.

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool.

Tell me to run and I'll race,
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,
And if you want me gone, I'll leave,
Just hold me closer, baby,
And make me crazy for you.
Crazy for you.

Lately with this state I'm in
I can't help myself but spin.
I wish you'd come over,
Send me spinning closer to you.

My oh my, how my blood boils,
It's sweet taste for you,
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favourite mood.

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,
But the more I do,
The crazier I turn into.

Pacing floors and opening doors,
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy,
Because I'm too crazy for you.
Crazy for you
