I've seen this one before, the girl she gets away
Everybody knows it but no one tries to stop it
Cause she barely even knows him but if she could see inside
Everything is quiet as she waits to tell him who she is

Is this all we get to be absolute

Quiet but I'm sure there is something here
Tell me everything cause I want to hear

It's a kiss that sits upon on her lips that waits for planes and battle ships
She wants to be a dancer and he has got a picture
On his wall and it's a sailor in a new port every night
Yet man was born to trouble like sparks fly upwards innocent

Is this all we get to be absolute

Quiet but I'm sure there is something here
Tell me everything cause I want to hear

All we are and all we want
40 years come and gone
All we are in photographs
Will never be taken
Quiet but I'm sure there is something here
Tell me everything cause I want you here
Quiet but I'm sure there is something here
Tell me everything cause I want to hear
