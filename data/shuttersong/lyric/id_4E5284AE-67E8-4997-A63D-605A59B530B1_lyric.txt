I know I've got my problems and it starts with me
She saw something inside that I can't see
And late at night yeah, she'll comfort me
Hold onto me, hold onto me

I got a nervous habit and I drink too much
She said she hates her life and wants to change her ways
She wakes in the night and whispers oh so quiet

Hold onto me, hold onto me
Don't you ever leave, don't you ever leave
I know I've got my problems and it's probably me
So hold onto me, hold onto me

I stayed up too late and it hurts to breathe
Said it's 4 A.M., girl go back to sleep
Sometimes at night I can hear her dream

Come rescue me, come rescue me
Don't you ever leave, don't you ever leave
I know we got our problems and it's probably me
So hold onto me, hold onto me

I'm a drifter's body in an open sea
And I've seen my reflection staring right back at me
With no place to go and you're left all alone
There's no place like home

Hold onto me, hold onto me
Just stay with me, just stay with me
I know we got our problems and you'll probably leave
So hold onto me, hold onto me

I could never leave, I will never leave
So hold onto me, hold onto me
