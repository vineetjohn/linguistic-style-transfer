I think I have everything I need
It got dark but now I think I see
The world around is full of arms
Still reaching out to me.

I hear the notes and belt them back to you
I feel loved, I'm burning like a fuse
I'm not afraid 'cause I know I've got
Nothing left to lose

I just wanted to say
I know I let you down
But I'm ready now

And I found a way
That I can tell the truth
Make it up to you

I know that I have always walked the line
In between confidence and lies
So many scenes are full of words
I wish I could rewind

But here you are forgiving me again
You'll never know how real to me you've been
This is a start
Another empty page where I begin

I just wanted to say
I know I let you down
But I'm ready now

And I found a way
That I can tell the truth
Make it up to you

I left home but there's one thing that I still know
It's always summer in my heart and in my soul

I loved you first
I love you still
I always will
I loved you first
I love you still
I always will

I just wanted to say
I know I let you down
But I'm ready now

And I found a way
That I can tell the truth
Make it up to you

I left home but there's one thing that I still know
It's always summer in my heart and in my soul
It's always summer in my heart and in my soul
It's always summer in my heart and in my soul
