You're a one of a one, a one of a kind
That you only find once in a lifetime
Made to fit like a fingerprint
A code that clicks open the gold mine
They say one man's trash is another man's treasure
When I found you, it was all pitter patter
Secretly, hit the lottery
Cause you're brighter than all of the Northern Lights
You speak to me, even in my dreams
Wouldn't let you go for even the highest price
They say one man's trash is another girl's treasure
So if it's up to me, I'm gonna keep you forever
Cause I understand you, we see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
Cause a double rainbow is hard to find
Was a phenomenon when you came along
Yeah, our chemistry was more than science
It was deafening, li-like lightning
It was striking, you couldn't deny it
They say one man's trash is another man's treasure
The two of us together make everything glitter
Cause I understand you, we see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
Cause a double rainbow is hard to find
To the bottom of the sea, I'd go to find you
Climb the highest peak to be right beside you
Every step I take, I'm keeping you in mind
Cause I understand you, we see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
Cause a double rainbow is hard to find
It's hard to find
It's hard to find
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime
