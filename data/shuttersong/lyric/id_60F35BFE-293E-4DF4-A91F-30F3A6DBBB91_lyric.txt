Habits Of My Heart - Jaymes Young
I can't say no
Ripping me apart
In a dark room  in cold sheets
I can't feel a damn thing
I lost myself between your legs
Your medicine is in my head
You know I'd rather be alone
But then you call me on the phone
Oh  the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close
You make it hard to let you go
I tell myself I like that
When you tie my hands behind my back
You're confident
I'll give you that
But if you love yourself you can fuck yourself
Cause I'd rather be alone
But you're fermented in my bones
Oh  the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close
You make it hard to let you go
Oh  the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close
You make it hard to let you go
Oh  the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close
