Okay, can I just, say something crazy?

I love crazy!

All my life has been a series of doors in my face
And then suddenly I bump into you

I was thinking the same thing! 'Cause like
I've been searching my whole life to find my own place
And maybe it's the party talking or the chocolate fondue

But with you...
But with you

I found my place...
I see your face...

And it's nothing like I've ever known before!
Love is an open door!
Love is an open door!
Love is an open door!

With you!
With you!
With you!
With you!

Love is an open door...

I mean it's crazy...
What?

We finish each other's-
Sandwiches!

That's what I was gonna say!

I've never met someone-

Who thinks so much like me!
Jinx! Jinx again!
Our mental synchronization
Can have but one explanation

You-
And I-
Were-
Just-

Meant to be!

Say goodbye...
Say goodbye...

To the pain of the past
We don't have to feel it anymore!

Love is an open door!
Love is an open door!
Life can be so much more!

With you!
With you!
With you!
With you!

Love is an open door...

Can I say something crazy?
Will you marry me?

Can I say something even crazier? Yes!
