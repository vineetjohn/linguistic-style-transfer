Hello,
it's me
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet,
to go over
Everything

They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be

When we were younger
and free

I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference
between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
to tell you I'm sorry
for everything that I've done

But when I call you never
seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
to tell you I'm sorry
for breaking your heart
But it don't matter,
it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello
how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself
I'm sorry

I hope
that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret
That the both of us are running out of time
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
to tell you I'm sorry
for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
to tell you I'm sorry
for breaking your heart
But it don't matter,
it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Anymore
