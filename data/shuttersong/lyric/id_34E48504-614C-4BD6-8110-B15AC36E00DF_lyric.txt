Dear future husband,
Here's a few things you need to know if
You wanna be my one and only
All my life

Take me on a date
I deserve it, babe
And don't forget the flowers every anniversary
'Cause if you'll treat me right
I'll be the perfect wife
Buying groceries
Buy, buy what you need

You got that 9 to 5
But baby so do I
So don't be thinking I'll be at home and making apple pies
I never learned to cook
But I can write a hook,
Sing along with me
Sing, sing along with me (hey)

You gotta know how to treat me like a lady
Even when I'm acting crazy
Tell me everything's alright

Dear future husband,
Here's a few things you'll need to know if

Dear future husband,
If you wanna get that special loving
Tell me I'm beautiful in each and every night

After every fight
Just apologize
And maybe then I'll let you try and rock my body right
Even if I was wrong
You know I'm never wrong
Why disagree?
Why, why disagree?

You gotta know how to treat me like a lady
Even when I'm acting crazy
Tell me everything's alright

Dear future husband
Make time for me, don't leave me lonely
And oh, we will never see your family more than mine

I'll be sleeping on the left side of the bed (hey)
Open doors for me and you may get some kisses
Don't have a dirty mind
Just be a classy guy
Buy me a ring
Buy, buy me a ring, babe

You gotta know how to treat me like a lady
Even when I'm acting crazy
Tell me everything's alright
