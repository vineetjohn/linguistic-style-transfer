I'll let you fall in love with me	
Show you how easy it can be	
California girl of your dreams	
Sitting by the sea shore	
Soaking up the summer breeze	
	
Never gonna fall, I'm never gonna fall	
For that old trick again	
Never gonna fall, I'm never gonna fall	
For that old trick again	
	
I can't believe I even came	
Don't even know your name	
Boy you know that ain't my scene	
But you gotta play by the rules	
If you ever gonna win the game	
	
Never gonna fall, I'm never gonna fall	
For that old trick again	
Never gonna fall, I'm never gonna fall	
For that old trick again	
	
Oh yes my words were true	
True to the moment and true to you	
But fear will help you make your move	
Sweet kisses in the summer taste soft like honeydew	
	
Never gonna fall, I'm never gonna fall	
For that old trick again	
Never gonna fall, I'm never gonna fall	
For that old trick again	
Never gonna fall, I'm never gonna fall	
For that old trick again	
Never gonna fall, I'm never gonna fall	
For that old trick again
