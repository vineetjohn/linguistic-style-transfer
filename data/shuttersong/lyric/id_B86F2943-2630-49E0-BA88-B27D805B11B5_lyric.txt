The star,
that gives us light
Has been gone a while
But it's not an illusion
The ache
In my heart
Is so much a part of who I am
Something in your eyes
Took a thousand years to get here
Something in your eyes
Took a thousand years, a thousand years

Hold me close, hold me close and don't let me go.
Hold me close like I'm someone that you might know
Hold me close the darkness just lets us see
Who we are
I've got your life inside of me

Iris... Iris...

Once we are born, we begin to forget
The very reason we came
But you
I'm sure I've met
Long before the night the stars went out
We're meeting up again

Hold me close, hold me close and don't let me go.
Hold me close like I'm someone that you might know
Hold me close, the darkness just lets us see
Who we are
I've got your life inside of me

Iris... Iris...

The stars are bright but do they know
The universe is beautiful but cold

You took me by the hand
I thought that I was leading you
But it was you made me your man
Machine
I dream
Where you are
Iris standing in the hall
She tells me I can do it all
Iris wakes to my nightmares
Don't fear the world it isn't there
Iris playing on the strand
She buries the boy beneath the sand,
Iris says that I will be the death of her
It was not me
Iris... Iris...
She said:"Free yourself, to be yourself if only you could see yourself"
Free yourself, to be yourself if only you could see...
