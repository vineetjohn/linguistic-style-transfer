Tell me what does it take to make good now
How many years do you wait?
Oh, and now all of the clouds are combining
The flickering light's just a flame
Oh but yeah, I'm so tired
I've been away for so many years
But I guess I'll just wait a bit longer
I'll stay 'til they open the gates

[Pre-Chorus:]
All my life I stay here waiting
Every new year, always making me
Feel as though there's nothing up there but
One day you came out of nowhere

[Chorus:]
1985 was a good year
The sky broke apart and you appeared
Dropped from the heavens, they call me a dreamer
I won't lie, I knew you would belong here
Lifted off the ground
I took your hands and pulled you down
Because 1985 was a good year
I won't lie, I knew you would belong here

Oh well, how many years has it been now?
How many days went to waste?
Now the rain and the thunder are clashing
The Sun's got a smile 'cross the face
Oh, but yeah I'm so tired
I fight so hard and come back beaten
Beacon, burn through it brightly
Soared through a sliver of space

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Lifted up
Lift us back to the sky and the world above
Lifted up
Lifted up

[Chorus]
