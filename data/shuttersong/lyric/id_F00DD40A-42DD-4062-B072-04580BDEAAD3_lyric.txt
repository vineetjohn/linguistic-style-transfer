Drag Me Down - One Direction
I've got fire for a heart I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul and baby you're a bow
Baby you're my only reason
If I didn't have you there would be nothing left
A shell of a man that could never be his best
If I didn't have you I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone yeah
All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me
All these lights that can't blind me
With your love nobody can drag me down
All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me
All these lights that can't blind me
With your love nobody can drag me down
Nobody nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody nobody
Nobody can drag me down
I've got fire for a heart I'm not scared of the dark

And baby you're my only reason
If I didn't have you there would be nothing left
A shell of a man who could never be his best
