I softly kiss your neck, and slowly whisper
You breathe in cause it feels cold where my lips were
T-shirt for a pillow, music up real low, creeping through the window
I can feel the bass line in the bed liner, and your heart on mineTryin' to jump up out of your chest
Baby you're now on fire, boy you're on fire

Out in the dark, wrapped up in the stars
So right, Boy I'm so high
You and me, wild and free
Way out in the woods no body for miles
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down Just us and the speakers on
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down Just us and the speakers on
Moonlights tracing those tree tops across your face
There's a feeling in your eyes the shadows can't erase
The cool wind around us is breezing around us

Following my fingers through your hair
The engine is idling and boy this heat lightning is flashing
Pictures of you and burning them in my head
And I'm on fire, boy you're on fire
Out in the dark, wrapped up in the stars
So right, Boy I'm so highYou and me, wild and free

Way out in the woods no body for miles
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down Just us and the speakers on
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down Just us and the speakers on
I'm tuned in to you, something's on your mind, ain't it
Go on and tell me baby, don't act like you can't say it
I know your body language, you ain't gotta translate it
Let it talk to me, till I can't take it Your lips
your hair, your smile, your touch, your kiss, your stare Your vibes too much
It lights me up, you got me set

I'm way too gone, so baby let your eyes close
Say my name and watch me goin' up in flames
Boy I'm on fire, Boy you're on fire
Out in the dark, where the wild things are
So right, Boy I'm so highYou and me, wild and free
Way out in the woods parked under the pines
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down Just us and the speakers on
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down Just us and the speakers on
