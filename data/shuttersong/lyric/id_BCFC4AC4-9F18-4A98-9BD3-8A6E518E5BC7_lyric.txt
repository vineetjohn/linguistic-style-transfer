GDFR (《速度与激情7》电影插曲)(Noodles Remix) - Flo Rida/Sage the Gemini/LooKas
It's going down for real
Your girl just kissed a girl
I do bi chicks
Shake for a sheik
I'm throwing these Emirates in the sky
Spinning this As-salamu alaykum
Peace to M O N E Y
I love my beaches  south beaches
Surfboard and high tide
I could just roll up
Cause I'm swoll up
So that birthday cake get a cobra
Buggati for real  I'm cold bruh
That auto-biography rover
Got the key to my city it's over
It's no thots  only Anna Kournikova's
I said rackets  ratchets hold up
I said rackets  ratchets hold up
I know what you came here to see
If you're a freak  then ya coming home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open let me see you get loose
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
And they already know me
It's it's going down
It's going down further than femurs
Girls get wetter than Katrina
Yeah my girl you never seen her
Cause my tints by limousines
My touch is the Midas
We de-plus your man to minus
My team blowing on that slam
Make you cough-cough that's Bronchitis
Put your hands up
It's a stick up  no more makeup
Get that ass on the floor
Ladies put your lipstick up
Double entendre  double entendre
While you're hating I get money
Then I double up tonkers
I know what you came here to see
If you're a freak  then ya coming home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open let me see you get loose
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's it's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's it's going down for real
Lift it  drop it  shake it  pop it
Lift it  drop it  shake it  pop it
Lift it  drop it  shake it  pop it
Lift it  drop it  shake it
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's it's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's it's going down for real
