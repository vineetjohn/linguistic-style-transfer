You know I'm bad at communication, it's the hardest thing for me to do
And it's said, it's the most important part that relationships will go through
And I'd give it all away
Just so I could say
That I know, I know, I know, I know that you're gonna be OK anyway

You know there's no rhyme or reason for the way you turned out to be
I didn't go and try to change my mind not intentionally
I know it's hard to hear me say
It but I can't bear to stay
And I just know, I know, I know, I know that you're gonna be OK anyway

Always keep your heart locked tight,
Don't let your mind retire, oh
But I just couldn't take it,
I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire

It felt right, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled him when I came down to the wire
It felt right, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled him when I came down to the wire

Does your imagination try to make you what you wanted to be?
Because I'm sorry I do what I did, but it came naturally
And I gave it all away
Just so I could say
That, well, I know, I know, I know, I know that you're gonna be OK anyway

Well, I try to keep myself together,
After all the opportunities
I try to stay true to you and try to do what you wanted for me
And I'd give it all away
Just to hear you say
That, well, I know, I know, I know, I know that you're gonna be OK anyway

Always keep your heart locked tight,
Don't let your mind retire, oh
But I just couldn't take it,
I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire

It felt right, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire
It felt right, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire
Ooh, yeah

Always keep your heart locked tight,
Don't let your mind retire
Always keep your heart locked tight,
Don't let your mind retire, oh
But I just couldn't take it,
I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire

But I just couldn't take it,
I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire

It felt right, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire
It felt right, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire

It felt right, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire
It felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire

Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no
It felt right
It felt right
It felt right
No, no, no, no
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire
