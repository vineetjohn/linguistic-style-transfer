Some people have to learn
Some people wait their turn
Some people have to fight
Some people give their lives

They wanna hold you back, tell 'em pee off
Whenever they say you can't take the c off
I remember when they told me I wouldn't be famous
Now my dream and reality's simultaneous

And, work your own way to the top
If they put you on a pedestal, they can take you off
And there's a higher level than the top
You gotta make more, don't make do with what you got

Yeah, so go and get it in, sonny
Not everybody get's a second chance at getting money
Or even getting lucky
So you gotta fill the hunger in your tummy

I'm always pushing myself to the limit
Making sure I stay ahead
You made me who I am
From the words you said

Some people have to learn
Some people wait their turn
Some people, but not me
I was born a champion

Some people have to fight
Some people give their lives
Some people don't believe
But I was born a champion

But I was born a champion
But I was born a champion

This gon' be the realist shit I ever wrote
Off the records, no cameras, forget a quote
Some of my family doing good, most doing dope
I'm from Virginia where they hang them niggas by a rope

I used to see my momma getting beat down
Is that the real definition of me now?
I fell off, back on my feet now
Heading to the sky, can't even see down

Award shows, I pour my heart out
And people still study, tryna point my flaws out
And I be lying if I say it ain't get to me
But I'm a champion, legend, history

I'm always pushing myself to the limit
Making sure I stay ahead
You made me who I am
From the words you said

Some people have to learn
Some people wait their turn
Some people, but not me
I was born a champion

Some people have to fight
Some people give their lives
Some people don't believe
But I was born a champion

But I was born a champion
But I was born a champion

Okay, no one wants to help, I guess you're on your own
Build the foundation with the bricks they've thrown
In a black and white world, true colors show
Change if you want, everybody grows

And life's like an ill, but try an' get a hold
Opinions ain't facts take 'em in an' let 'em go
You made me who I am
From the words you said

Some people have to learn
Some people wait their turn
Some people, but not me
I was born a champion

Some people have to fight
Some people give their lives
Some people don't believe
But I was born a champion

Some people have to learn
Some people wait their turn
Some people, but not me
I was born a champion

Some people have to fight
Some people give their lives
Some people don't believe
But I was born a champion

But I was born a champion
But I was born a champion
