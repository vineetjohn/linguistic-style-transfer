Oh say, can you see? This is not who I'm supposed to be
Without you I'm nobody killing time
I tried to deceive, tried to win you desperately
Now I'm lost in this swirling sea of your sorry eyes
All my life I've been waiting for moments to come

When I catch fire and watch over you like the sun
I will fight to fix up and get things right
I can't change the world but maybe I'll change your mind
Oh say, do you know? I'm a fool in a one man show

I'm a broken stereo, out of time
So how does it feel? Alone, is it so surreal?
Cause the ghost of survivor's guilt can be so unkind
All my life I've been waiting for moments to come

When I catch fire and watch over you like the sun
I will fight to fix up and get things right
I can't change the world but maybe I'll change your mind
The words you speak, surrounding me

This is broken love in the first degree
The air you breathe is haunting me
Maybe I'll change your mind
All my life I've been waiting for moments to come

When I catch fire and watch over you like the sun
I will fight to fix up and get things right
I can't change the world
I know that I can't change the world
But maybe I'll change your mind
