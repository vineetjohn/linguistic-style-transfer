Most of my life, I sat on my hands, I don't make a sound
Getting it right, I made all my plans, lost, never found
Your eyes, your smile can light up the night, night
Embers and neon signs paint up black sky, sky

Airplanes cut through the clouds
Like angels can fly, we'll never die
Sirens cut through the night
Like screams set on fire, rising up higher
I've got something to prove, nothing to lose
In this city, in this city woah

All of this time, I questioned myself, I never could wait
Looking for signs, not asking for help, I know it's too late
Love lost and buried here, it comes to life, life
Make believe worlds make us all feel alive, alive

Airplanes cut through the clouds
Like angels can fly, we'll never die
Sirens cut through the night
Like screams set on fire, rising up higher
I've got something to prove, nothing to lose
In this city, in this city oh

I don't ever wanna wait for this, I know that I was made for this
I won't fade into dark
I'm not gonna say that I'm sorry, gonna see the end of this story
I won't fade into darkness

Airplanes cut through the clouds
Like angels can fly, we'll never die
Sirens cut through the night
Like screams set on fire, rising up higher
I've got something to prove, nothing to lose
In this city, in this city oh
