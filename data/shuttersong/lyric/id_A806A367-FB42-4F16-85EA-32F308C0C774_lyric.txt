Don't worry, I won't hurt U

I was dreamin' when I wrote this

Forgive me if it goes astray

But when I woke up this mornin'

Coulda sworn it was judgment day

The sky was all purple

There were people runnin' everywhere

Tryin' 2 run from the destruction

U know I didn't even care

 

'Cuz they say two thousand zero zero party over

Oops out of time

So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999

 

I was dreamin' when I wrote this

So sue me if I go 2 fast

But life is just a party

And parties weren't meant 2 last

War is all around us

My mind says prepare 2 fight

So if I gotta die I'm gonna listen 2 my body tonight

Yeah, they say two thousand zero zero party over

Oops out of time

So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999

Don't bother knockin' on my door

I got a lion in my pocket

And baby he's ready 2 roar

Yeah, everybody's got a bomb

We could all die any day

But before I'll let that happen

I'll dance my life away
