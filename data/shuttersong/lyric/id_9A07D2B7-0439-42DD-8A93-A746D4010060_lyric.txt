Hello, it's me...
I was wondering
If after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal you
But ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt
Before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call
You never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say
That I've tried to tell you
I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me
To talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call
You never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say
That I've tried to tell you
I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Oh, anymore...
Hello from the other side
