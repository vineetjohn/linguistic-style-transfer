Started at the age of four
My mother went to the grocery store
Went sneaking through her bedroom door to find something in a size four

Sugar and spice and everything nice wasn't made for only girls

King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in a leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me

My daddy threw me in therapy
He thinks I'm not a real man
Who put the drag in the drag queen

Sugar and spice and everything nice wasn't made for only girls
GI Joe in panty hose is making room for the

King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in a leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me
