Do you remember, 21st night of September?

Love was changing the mind of pretenders

While chasing the clouds away

Our hearts were ringing

In the key that our souls were singing

As we danced in the night

Remember, how the stars stole the night away

Hey hey hey

Ba de ya, say that you remember

Ba de ya, dancing in September

Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day

Ba duda, ba duda, ba duda, badu

Ba duda, badu, ba duda, badu

Ba duda, badu, ba duda, yeah
My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember, how we knew love was here to stay
Now December
Found the love we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember, the true love we share today
Hey hey hey
Ba de ya, say that you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day
