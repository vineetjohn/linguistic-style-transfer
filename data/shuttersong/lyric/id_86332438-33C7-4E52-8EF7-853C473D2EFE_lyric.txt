I am a fighter, it's in my DNA
Step by step, and break by break, nobody stopping me
Quit try to shoot me down, 'cause I'm invincible
I think you made a mistake, I am warrior

I stand like a soldier, yeah
Strike like a tiger
I stand like a soldier, yeah
Punch like a champion

I'm gonna dance, dance, dance to the beat of my drum
Gonna feel myself while I'm riding you
Gonna dance, dance, dance to the beat of my drum
Like a warrior

Warrior

I am a blizzard, so don't get in my way
I keep on blowing 'til there's nothing left in front of me
You wanna take my crown, but I'm invincible
You are a venomous snake, but I'm a warrior

I stand like a soldier, yeah
Strike like a tiger
I stand like a soldier, yeah
Punch like a champion

I'm gonna dance, dance, dance to the beat of my drum
Gonna feel myself while I'm riding you
Gonna dance, dance, dance to the beat of my drum
Like a warrior

People can say what they wanna say
When I'm in the ring, baby, I'm heavy-weight
I'm not gonna run when I hear them call, hear them call

I stand like a soldier, yeah
Strike like a tiger
I stand like a soldier, yeah
Punch like a champion
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance to the beat of my drum
