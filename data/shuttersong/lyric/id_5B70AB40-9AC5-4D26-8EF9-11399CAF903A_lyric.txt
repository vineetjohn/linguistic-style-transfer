I've been trying to get to you for a long time
Cause constantly you've been on my mind
I was thinking 'bout a short cut that I could take
But I found I made a mistake

I was wrong... It took too long
I got caught in a rush hour
Fellows started to shower
you with love and affection
Now you won't look at my direction

On the expressway to your heart
That expressway that's the best way

At five o'clock it's much too crowded (Too crowded)
Much too crowded (Too crowded)...Much too crowded (Too crowded)
Too crowded for me
Couldn't get through to you baby
Oh, it's too crowded

Well there're too many in back of me
And they're all tryin' to get in front of me
I was thinking I saw a road up ahead
But I saw a stoplight instead

I was wrong... It took too long
I got caught in a rush hour
Fellows started to shower
you with love and affection
Now you won't look at my direction

On the expressway to your heart
That expressway that's the best way

I was wrong... It took too long
I got caught a rush hour
Fellows started to shower
you with love and affection
C'mon look in my direction

On the expressway to your heart
That expressway that's the best way
That expressway to your heart
That espressway that's the best way

At five o'clock it's too crowded (Too crowded)
Much too crowded (Too crowded)
Much too crowded (Too crowded)
Too crowded
Too crowded for me
Just couldn't get through baby
Oh, oh, oh, much too crowded
Oh, oh, oh, much too crowded
