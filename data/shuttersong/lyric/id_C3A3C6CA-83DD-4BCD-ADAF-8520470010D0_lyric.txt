 You made me insecure
Told  me I wasn¡¯t good enough
But who are  you to judge
When  you¡¯re a diamond in the rough
I¡¯m sure  you got some things
 You¡¯d like to change about yourself
But when it comes to  me
I wouldn¡¯t want to be anybody else
Na na na
I¡¯m no beauty queen
I¡¯m just beautiful  me
Na na na
 You¡¯ve got every right
To a beautiful life
cmon
Who says
Who says  you¡¯re not perfect
Who says  you¡¯re not worth it
Who says  you¡¯re the only one that¡¯s hurting
Trust  me
That¡¯s the price of beauty
Who says  you¡¯re not pretty
Who says  you¡¯re not beautiful
Who says
It¡¯s such a funny thing
How nothing¡¯s funny when it¡¯s  you
 You tell ¡®em what  you mean
But they keep whiting out the truth
It¡¯s like a work of art
That never gets to see the light
Keep  you beneath the stars
Won¡¯t let  you touch the sky
Na na na
I¡¯m no beauty queen
I¡¯m just beautiful  me
Na na na
 You¡¯ve got every right
To a beautiful life
Cmon
