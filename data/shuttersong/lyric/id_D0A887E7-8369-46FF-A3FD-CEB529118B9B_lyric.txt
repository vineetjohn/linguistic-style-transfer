A week ago you said to me
"Do you believe I'll never be too far?"
If you're lost, just look for me

You'll find me in the region of the summer stars
Fact that we can sit right here and say goodbye
Means we've already won
A necessity for apologies between you and me
Baby, there is none

We had some good times, didn't we?
We had some good tricks up our sleeve
Goodbyes are bittersweet
But it's not the end
I'll see your face again
You will find me

And you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind
Walking in the wind
Yesterday I went out to celebrate the birthday of a friend
But as we raised our glasses up to make a toast

I realized you were missing
We had some good times, didn't we?
We wore our hearts out on our sleeve
Goodbyes are bittersweet

But it's not the end
I'll see your face again
You will find me
And you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand

Walking in the wind
Walking in the wind
I know I'll be your anchor
Just close your eyes and see
I'll be by your side
Any time you're needing me

You will find me
And you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind
Walking in the wind
Walking in the wind
