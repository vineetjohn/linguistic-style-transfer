Hello,
I've waited here for you...
Everlong.
Tonight,
I throw myself into,
And out of the red, out of her head she sang.

Come down
And waste away with me,
Down with me...
Slow how,
You wanted it to be,
I'm over my head, out of her head she sang.

And I wonder when I sing along with you,
If everything could ever feel this real forever.
If anything could ever be this good again,
The only thing I'll ever ask of you.
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when.
She sang:

Breathe out,
So I can breathe you in,
Hold you in,
And now,
I know you've always been there
Out of your head, out of my head I sang.

And I wonder when I sing along with you,
If everything could ever feel this real forever,
If anything could ever be this good again.
The only thing I'll ever ask of you,
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when.
She sang:

And I wonder...
If everything could ever feel this real forever,
If anything could ever be this good again.
The only thing I'll ever ask of you,
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when.
