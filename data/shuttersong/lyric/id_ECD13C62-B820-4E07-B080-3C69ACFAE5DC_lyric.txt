Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll
My windows down and cruise
Hey baby
Yeah  when I first saw that bikini top on her
She's poppin right out of
The South Georgia water
Thought  "Oh  good lord 
She had them long tanned legs"
Couldn't help myself so I walked up and said
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll
My windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin
Stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll
My windows down and cruise
She was sippin on southern
And singin Marshall Tucker
We were falling in love in
The sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into
The cab of my truck and said
"Fire it up  let's go get this thing stuck"
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll
My windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin
Stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll
My windows down and cruise
When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those
KC lights and drove all night
'Cause it felt so right 
Her and I  man we felt so right
I put it in park and
Grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Hell I can't get you out of my head
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll
My windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin
Stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll
My windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin
Stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell lot better
With you up in it
Come on
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll
My windows down and cruise
Come on girl
Get those windows down and cruise
