I Really Like You - Carly Rae Jepsen
I really wanna stop
But I just gotta taste for it
I feel like I could fly with the ball on the moon
So honey hold my hand you like making me wait for it
I feel I could die walking up to the room  oh yeah
Late night watching television
But how we get in this position 
It's way too soon  I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you  do you want me  do you want me  too 
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you  do you want me  do you want me  too 
Oh  did I say too much 
I'm so in my head
When we're out of touch
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you  do you want me  do you want me  too 
It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
All I wanna do is get into your head
Yeah we could stay alone  you and me  and this temptation
Sipping on your lips  hanging on by thread  baby
Late night watching television
But how we get in this position 
It's way too soon  I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you  do you want me  do you want me  too 
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you  do you want me  do you want me  too 
Oh  did I say too much 
I'm so in my head
When we're out of touch
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you  do you want me  do you want me  too 
Who gave you eyes like that 
Said you could keep them
I don't know how to act
The way I should be leaving
I'm running out of time
Going out of my mind
I need to tell you something
Yeah  I need to tell you something
Yeah I really really really really really really like you
And I want you  do you want me  do you want me  too 
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you  do you want me  do you want me  too 
Oh  did I say too much 
I'm so in my head
When we're out of touch
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you  do you want me  do you want me  too 
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you  do you want me  do you want me  too 
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you  do you want me  do you want me  too
