Here I am
There you are

Why does it seem so far
Next to you is where I should be (where I wanna be)
Something I

Want so bad
Know what's inside your head
Maybe I could see what you see (tell me what you see)
Gotta keep on believing
That everything takes time
I'll make up any reason
To make you mine

If you're staying or leaving

I'll follow your lead
So why keep pretending
Open your eyes

I can be what you need
Any kind of guy you want, girl
That's the kind of (that's the kind of)
Turn myself upside down (yes I will, yes I will)
Any kind of guy you want, girl
You know I'll agree
Turn your whole world around (yes I will, yes I will)
Any kind, any kind
Any kind of guy you want

You decide
Change your mind

I will be there
Won't you try
One more try

Be my any kind of girl
You decide

It's alright
I will be there
You seem so hard to know

Say goodbye, say hello
Then you say that it's time to go (now it's time to go)
Changing my point of view
Everyday something new

Anything to get next to you (gonna get to you)
Gotta keep on believing
That everything takes time
I'll make up any reason
To make you mine
If you're staying or leaving
I'll follow your lead
So why keep pretending

Open your eyes
I can be what you need

Any kind of guy you want, girl
That's the kind I'll be (that's the kind I'll be)
Turn myself upside down (yes I will, yes I will)

Any kind of guy you want, girl

You know I'll agree (you know I'll agree)
Turn your whole world around (yes I will, yes I will)
Any kind, any kind
Any kind of guy you want
You decide
Change your mind

I will be there (I'll be there)
Won't you try
One more try
Be my any kind of girl

You decide
It's alright
I will be there
Let me know if I'm getting through

Making you understand
If it's wrong I'll try something new (try something
New)

Don't look away
Cause I'm here to stay
If it's a game

Then I'm gonna play
