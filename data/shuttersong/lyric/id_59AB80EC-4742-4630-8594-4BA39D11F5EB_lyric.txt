I don't know, it's just something about ya
Got me feeling like I can't be without ya
Anytime someone mention your name
I be feeling as if I'm around ya

Ain't no words to describe you baby
All I know is that you take me high
Can you tell that you drive me crazy?
Cause I can¡¯t get you out my mind

Thinkin of ya when I'm goin to bed
When I wake up think of ya again
You are my homie, lover and friend
Exactly why

You light me up inside
Like the 4th of July 
Whenever your around 
I always seem to smile 

And people ask me how
Well your the reason why
I'm dancing in the mirror and singing in the shower 
Ladade ladada ladada
singing in the shower 
Ladade ladada ladada

All I want, all I need is your lovin
Baby you make me hot like an oven 
Since you came you know what I've discovered
Baby I don't need me another

No, no all I know (know)
Only you got me feelin so (so)
And you know that I have to have ya
And I don't plan to let you go 

Thinkin of ya when I'm goin to bed
When I wake up think of ya again
You are my homie, lover and friend
Exactly why

You light me up inside
Like the 4th of July 
Whenever your around

But I'll take a chance on we
Baby let's take our time

And when the times get rough
There ain't no given up
Cause it just feels so right

Don't care what others say

You bring my heart to life yeah

You light me up inside
