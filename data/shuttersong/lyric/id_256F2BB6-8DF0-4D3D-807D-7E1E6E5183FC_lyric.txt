Word on the street, you got something to show me, me
Magical, colorful, myster-mystery
I'm intrigued for a peak
Heard it's fascinating

Come on, baby, let me see
What'ch'you hiding underneath

What's up your sleeve, such a tease, wanna see the show
In 3-D, a movie
Heard it's beautiful

Be the judge, of my girls, gonna take a vote

Come on, baby, let me see
What'ch'you hiding underneath

I want the jaw dropping, eye popping, head turning, body shocking
I want my heart throbbing, ground shaking, show stopping, amazing

Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Don't be a chicken, boy, stop acting like a biotch
Imma peace out if you don't give me the pay off

Come on, baby, let me see
What'ch'you hiding underneath

Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
What'ch'you waiting for? It's time for you to show it off
Don't be a shy kind of guy, I'll bet it's beautiful

Skip the talk, heard it all, time to walk the walk
Break me off, if you bitch, show me who's the boss
Need some goose, stick it loose, come on, take a shot

You got the finest architecture
End-of-the-rainbow-looking treasure
