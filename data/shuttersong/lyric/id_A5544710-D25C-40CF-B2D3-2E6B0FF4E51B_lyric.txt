Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me-e-e-e-e

I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me-e-e-e-e-ee

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down, oh

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing

And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
Now I see, now I see, now I see-e-e-e-e-ee

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in, ohh
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down, oh

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been, yeah
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

When your saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything, yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (never been)
So you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been, uhh
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
