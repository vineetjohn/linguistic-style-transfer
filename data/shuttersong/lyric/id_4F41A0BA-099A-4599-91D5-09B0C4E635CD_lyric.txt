Wise men say, only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay? Would it be a sin?
If I can't help falling in love with you
Like a river flows, surely to the sea

Darling so it goes, some things are meant to be
Take my hand, take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you
Like a river flows, surely to the sea
