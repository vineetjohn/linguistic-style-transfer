Check that out, what they playin'
That's my song, that's my song
Where my drinks
I've been waiting much too long, much too long
And this girl on my lap passing out, she's a blonde
The last thing on my mind is going home

From the window to the wall
This club is jumping, til tomorrow
Is it daylight or is it nightime?
1 o'clock 2 o'clock 3 o'clock 4
We gon' tear the club up, up, up, up, up, up, up

Ayo me say day oh
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home
Yeah so we losing control
Turn the lights low cause we about to get blown

Let the club shut down
We won't go oh oh oh
Burn it down
To the flo oh oh oh
Ayo me say day oh
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home

We drink the whole bottle but it ain't over over
Everybody jumping on the sofa sofa
Standing on the chairs
Standing on the bars
No matter day or night I'm shining
Bitch, I'm a star

From the window to the wall
This club is jumping, til tomorrow
Is it daylight or is it nightime
1 o'clock 2 o'clock 3 o'clock 4
We gon' tear the club up, up, up, up, up, up, up

Ayo me say day oh
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home
Yeah so we losing control
Turn the lights low cause we about to get blown

Let the club shut down
We won't go oh oh oh
Burn it down
To the flo oh oh oh
Ayo me say day oh
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home

I just met this sexy Haitian girl moving like a dancer
Told her and her girlfriend let's meet in my cobana
Ask me where the party's at baby I'm the answer
Have another drink with me shawty where your manners
Take another shot another shot shot shot shot
I can make it hot make it hot we go rock into the

Ayo me say day oh
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home
Yeah so we losing control
Turn the lights low cause we about to get blown

Let the club shut down
We won't go oh oh oh
Burn it down
To the flo oh oh oh
Ayo me say day oh
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home
