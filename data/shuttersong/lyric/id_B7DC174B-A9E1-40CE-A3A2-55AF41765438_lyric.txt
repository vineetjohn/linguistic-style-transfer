To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left

Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet that's my stuff, yes
If I bought it please don't touch

And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags

Let me call you a cab
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I'm such a fool, talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you

You got me twisted
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute

Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow

So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
So go ahead and get gone
And call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet ya thought that I didn't know

What did you think I was putting you out for?
Because you was untrue
Rolling her around in the car that I bought you
Baby drop them keys

Hurry up before your taxi leaves
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I'm such a fool, talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you

You got me twisted
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute

Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I'll have another you by tomorrow

So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
you're irreplaceable
So since I'm not your everything
How about I'll be nothing, nothing at all to you

Baby I won't shed a tear for you, I won't lose a wink of sleep
'Cause the truth of the matter is replacing you is so easy
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left

To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me

I can have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute
You could pack all you things, we're finished
(You must not know 'bout me)
'Cause you made your bed, now lay in it
(You must not know 'bout me)
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
you're irreplaceable
