Ooh, yeah! All right!
We're jammin':
I wanna jam it with you.
We're jammin', jammin'
And I hope you like jammin', too.

Ain't no rules, ain't no vow, we can do it anyhow:
I'n'I will see you through
'Cos everyday we pay the price with a little sacrifice
Jammin' till the jam is through.

We're jammin'
To think that jammin' was a thing of the past
We're jammin'
And I hope this jam is gonna last.

No bullet can stop us now, we neither beg nor we won't bow
Neither can be bought nor sold.
We all defend the right; Jah-Jah children must unite:
Your life is worth much more than gold.

We're jammin' (jammin', jammin', jammin')
And we're jammin' in the name of the Lord
We're jammin' (jammin', jammin', jammin')
We're jammin' right straight from Yah.

Holy Mount Zion

And rules all creation

To keep you satisfied.
