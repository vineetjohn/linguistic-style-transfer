Hold me close and hold me fast
This magic spell you cast
This is la vie en rose

When you kiss me, heaven signs
And though I close my eyes
I see la vie en rose

When you press me to your heart
I'm in a world apart
A world where roses bloom

And when you speak, angels, sing from above
Everyday words seem
to turn into love songs

Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be
La vie en rose
And when you speak, angels, sing from above
Everyday words seem
to turn into love songs
Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be
La vie en rose
