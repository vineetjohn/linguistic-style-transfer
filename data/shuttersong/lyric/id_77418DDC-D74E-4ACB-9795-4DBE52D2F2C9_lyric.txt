Just 'cause your heart’s afraid
Doesn’t give the right to say
I was born this way

You see the part you played
All the silhouettes you’ve made
Fleet the light of day

I wish I was innocent in a bad way
But I’ve found
You don’t come after soldiers
Unless they were yours in the first place

Oh, I swim in a violet sea
But I’m bending the light connecting you to me
So write a ‘lettre de marque’ and see
Oh, if this dark matter heart can bleed out right

Why do I push away?
When your welcome is overstayed
All I breathe is grey
But through the disarray
You’re the emissary vein
To my left right brain
Oh, 'cause I wish I was reticent in my own strength
But I’ve found
You don’t hold your composure
When I say that with a straight face

See, you brought your wits about you
The black bear that’ll haunt you
If I can feel it, why do I need to see it – do I?
See, you brought your wits about you
The black bear that’ll haunt you
I don’t see it, oh, did I ever feel it – did I?
See, you brought your wits about you
The black bear that’ll haunt you
