Snowflakes on my window pane
Calling rudolph out by name
Join in all the reindeer games
It's Christmas coming home

Picking out the perfect tree
Stringing lights of red and green
Prettiest star you've ever seen
It's Christmas coming home

Sitting by the fire burning
Listening to children learning
Christmas songs, they sing along
(Here comes santa claus)
(Here comes santa claus)

Over the hills of snow
Bundled up with a rosey nose
The time is night come inside
It's Christmas coming home

Going out tobogganing
Wearing mittens on a string
Listening to the sleigh bells ring
It's Christmas coming home

Decorate like candy land
Paper angels hand in hand
Bring out the marching band
It's Christmas coming home

Sitting by the fire burning
Listening to children learning
Christmas songs, they sing along
(Here comes santa claus)
(Here comes santa claus)

Over the hills of snow
Bundled up with a rosey nose
The time is night come inside
It's Christmas coming home

Winter white is coming down
Friends and family gather round
Let peace and love on earth be found
It's Christmas coming home

Sitting by the fire burning
Listening to children learning
Christmas songs, they sing along
(Here comes santa claus)
(Here comes santa claus)

Over the hills of snow
Bundled up with a rosey nose
The time is night come inside
It's Christmas coming home

The time is night come inside
It's Christmas coming home
It's Christmas 
Christmas
Coming home
