Good Girls (Live From The iTunes Festival) - 5 Seconds Of Summer

She's a good girl
She's Daddy's favorite
He's saved for Harvard
He know she'll make it
She's good at school
She's never truant
She can speak French
I think she's fluent
'Cause every night she studies hard in her room
At least that's what her parents assume
But she sneaks out the window to meet with her boyfriend
Here's what she told me the time that I caught 'em
She said to me:
Forget what you thought
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
So just turn around and forget what you saw
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
She's a good girl
A straight A student
She's really into all that selfimprovement
I swear she lives in that library
But if you ask her she'll say
That's where you'll find me
But if you look then you won't find her there
She may be clever but she just acts too square
'Cause in the back of the room where nobody looks
She'll be with her boyfriend
She's not reading books
She said to me:
Forget what you thought
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
So just turn around and forget what you saw
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
Do do do ddo do do do do do
Good girls are bad girls and good girls are bad girls
Do do do ddo do do do do do
Good girls are bad girls just good girls are bad girls
She's a good girl
Hasn't been caught
She's a
She said to me:
Forget what you thought
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
So just turn around and forget what you saw
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
She said to me: (She said to me)
Forget what you thought
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
So just turn around
And forget what you saw
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
