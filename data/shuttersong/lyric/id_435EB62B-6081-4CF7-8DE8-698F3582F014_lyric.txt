How do I end up in the same old place
Faced again with the same mistakes
So stubborn thinking I know what is right
But life proves me wrong everytime
Taking roads that lead me nowhere
How do I expect to get there
But when will I learn to just put you first.

I come to you now when I need you
But why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong cause only with you can I move on.
Can I move on.

When I am weak it's you that makes me strong
And I know that you've been with me all along
So many times I begin to close my eyes and listen to my heart
With you life is so easy why do I make it hard
Oh taking roads that lead me nowhere how do I expect to get there when will I
Learn to just put you first.

Hey!
I come to you now when I need you
But why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong cause only with you can I move on.

I get out of my own way, let you have your way.
Cause I realize I'm no good on my own
I'm there for you, I'll serve for you
I can't live without you. Noooo

I come to you now when I need you
why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own
but I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong.
With only you, only you, with only you.
Can I move on, can I move on, can I move on...
