O, beautiful for spacious skies
For amber waves of grain
For purple mountains majesty
Above the fruited plain

America, America
God shed his grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea

O beautiful for pilgrim feet
Whose stern, impassioned stress
A thoroughfare for freedom beat
Across the wilderness!

America! America!
God mend thine every flaw
Confirm thy soul in selft-control
Thy liberty in law.

O, beautiful for heroes proved
In liberating strife
Who more than self their country loved
And mercy more than life
America, America
May God thy gold refine
'Till all success be nobleness
And every gain divine
O beautiful for patriot dream
That sees beyond the years
Thine alabaster cities gleam
Undimmed by human tears
America! America!
God shed His grace on thee
And grow thy good
With brotherhood
From sea to shining sea.
