Afraid - The Neighbourhood
 
Make that money  fake that bummy  ache my tummy
On the fence  all the time
Paid junk honey  a face so sunny  ain't that funny
All my friends always lie to me
I know they're thinking 
 
You're too mean  I don't like you  f*ck you anyway
You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs
It hurts but I won't fight you  you suck anyway
You make me wanna die  right when I 
 
When I wake up I'm afraid  somebody else might take my place
When I wake up I'm afraid  somebody else might take my place
When I wake up I'm afraid  somebody else might take my place
When I wake up I'm afraid  somebody else might end up being me 
 
Keep on dreaming  don't stop breathing  fight those demons
Sell your soul  not your whole self
If they see it when you're sleeping  make them leave and
And I can't even see if it's all there anymore so 
 
You're too mean  I don't like you  f*ck you anyway
You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs
It hurts but I won't fight you  you suck anyway
You make me wanna die  right when I 
 
When I wake up I'm afraid  somebody else might take my place
When I wake up I'm afraid  somebody else might take my place
When I wake up I'm afraid  somebody else might take my place
When I wake up I'm afraid  somebody else might end up being me 
 
Being me can only mean feeling scared to breathe
If you leave me then I'll be afraid of everything
That makes me anxious  gives me patience  calms me down
Lets me face this  let me sleep  and when I wake up 
Let me breathe
 
When I wake up I'm afraid  somebody else might take my place
When I wake up I'm afraid  somebody else might take my place
When I wake up I'm afraid  somebody else might take my place
When I wake up I'm afraid  somebody else might end up being me
