She planned ahead for a year
He said let's play it by ear
She didn't want him to run
He didn't want her to fear
Nobody said it'd be easy
They knew it was rough but tough luck
I fell in love today
There aren't many words that you can say
That could ever get my mind to change
She's in love for me
She's in love with me

You're a doll, you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love
The only flaw, you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us

I just can't wait for love.

So, she put his heart in a bag
He wouldn't ask for it back
He didn't want her to cry
She didn't want to be sad
She said you'd better not leave me
This shit'll be fucked for days, and weeks, and months, but...
I fell in love today
There aren't many words that you can say
That could ever get my mind to change

She's in love for me
She's in love with me

You're a doll, you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love

The only flaw, you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love

Add it all up, I can find it
The problem with love, is I'm blinded by...
It rattles my lungs, but my mind is

Tingled between your little flaws
Your flaws
Your flaws
Your flaws

You're a doll, you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love
The only flaw, you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love
Wait for love
I won't wait for love
Wait for love
I won't wait for love
Wait for love
