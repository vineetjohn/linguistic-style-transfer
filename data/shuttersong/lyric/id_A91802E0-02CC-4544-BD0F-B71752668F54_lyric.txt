You change your mind like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS like a bitch that I know
And you always think, always speak cryptically
You're no good for me
'Cause you're hot and you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You, you don't really wanna stay, no
But you, you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
(Uh, what's your problem? Like we used to be chill and stuff.
We used to be just like twins, so in sync
The same energy now's a dead battery
Used to laugh 'bout nothing, now you're plain boring
I should know that you're not gonna change
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
You're black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You, you don't really wanna stay, no
But you, you don't really wanna go, oh
Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love biploar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride
You change your mind like a psycho bitch,
but the sex is good so I think I'll keep ya around, ahem what?
You're just too damn hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
You're black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We hug, we make up
You, you don't really wanna stay, no
But you, you don't really wanna go, oh
Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes and you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up and you're down
