One went out at a bus stop in Edinburgh
One went out in an English pub
One went out in a nightclub when I was fifteen
Little lights in my heart

One went out when I lied to my mother
Said the cigarettes she found were not mine
One went out within me, now I smoke like a chimney
Its getting dark in this heart of mine
Its getting dark in this heart of mine

We're born with millions of little lights shining in the dark
And they show us the way
One lights up
Every time you feel love in your heart
One dies when it moves away

One went out in the backstreets of Manchester
One went out in an airport in Spain
One went out, I've no doubt, when I grew up and moved out
Of the place where the boy used to play

One went out when Uncle Ben got his tumour
We used to fish and I fish no more
Though he will not return
I know one still burns
On a fishing boat off the New Jersey shore
On a fishing boat off the New Jersey shore

We're born with millions of little lights shining in the dark
And they show us the way
One lights up
Every time we feel love in our hearts
One dies when it moves away

We're born with millions of little lights shining in our hearts
And they die along the way
Till we're old and we're cold
And lying in the dark
'Cos they'll all burn out one day
They'll all burn out one day
They'll all burn out one day
They'll all burn out one day
