 New Year's Day
A world in white gets underway
I want to be with you
Be with you night and  day
Nothing changes on  New  Year 's  Day
On  New  Year 's  Day
I will be with you again
I will be with you again
Under a blood red sky
A crowd has gathered in black and white
Arms entwined' the chosen few
The newspapers says' says
Say it 's true its true...
And we can break through
Though torn in two
We can be one
I...I will begin again
I...I will begin again
I...I will begin again
I...I will begin again
I...I will begin again
I...I will begin again
I...I will begin again
I...I will begin again
