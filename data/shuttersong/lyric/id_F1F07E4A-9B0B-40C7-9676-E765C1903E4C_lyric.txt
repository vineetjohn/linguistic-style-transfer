I had a way then
Losing it all on my own
I had a heart then
But the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping up
The strength I need to push me
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cuz they're calling  calling  calling me home
Calling  calling  calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone
Noises  I play within my head
Touch my own skin
And hope they'll still be there
And I think back to when
My brother and my sister slept
In another place
The only time I feel safe
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cuz they're calling  calling  calling me home
Calling  calling  calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone
Lights  lights   
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cuz they're calling  calling  calling me home
Calling  calling  calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone
Home  home
Lights  lights  lights
