R-Red wine Friday night never forget it
How you let me go
No more lies I'll be fine I know where I'm headed

Probably should've known
Now you're gonna say pretty please forgive me
Fooled me once, told you twice your gonna regret it
Now you're all alone yeah
Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent you can't erase me
I'll help you remember me
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste
Close your eyes you can't hide try to forget me but I'm everywhere
I'm the smell on your sheets you will regret it when you left me there
Now you're gonna say pretty please forgive me yeah
Bet it hurts it gets worse you know nobody said it would be fair oh yeah
Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent you can't erase me
I'll help you remember me
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste
And now there's something in your way
Cause you threw it all to waste
And you wonder if you can take back what you did that day and it hurts 'cause
Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent you can't erase me
I'll help you remember me
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste
Truth is that no one can replace me
I'm permanent you can't erase me
I'll help you remember me
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste
And the aftertaste
