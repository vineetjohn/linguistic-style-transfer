"A Change Of Heart"

Are we awake?
Am I too old to be this stoned?
Was it your breasts from the start? They played a part.

For goodness sake
I wasn't told you'd be this cold
Now it's my time to depart and I just had a change of heart

I'll quote "on the road" like a twat and wind my way out of the city
Finding a girl who is equally pretty won't be hard
Oh, I just had a change of heart

You smashed a glass into pieces
And that's around the time I left
And when you were coming across as clever
Then you lit the wrong end of your cigarette
You said I'm full of diseases
Your eyes were full of regret
And then you took a picture of your salad
And put it on the internet

And she said, "I've been so worried 'bout you lately"
"You look shit and smell a bit"
You're mad thinking you could ever save me
Not looking like that

You used to have a face straight out of a magazine
Now you just look like anyone
I just had a change of heart
I feel as though I was deceived
I never found love in the city
I just sat in self-pity and cried in the car
Oh I just had a change of heart

Then she said, "I've been so worried 'bout you lately
You were fit but you're losing it
You played a part, this is how it starts"
Oh I just had a change of heart

I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
Oh I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
