What I've got, you've got to give it to your mamma
What I've got, you've got to give it to your pappa
What I've got, you've got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I've got, you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got, you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got, you've got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling, don't stop continue
Realize, I don't want to be a miser

Confide with sly, you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser?
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now

Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
I can't tell, if I'm a king pin or a pauper
Greedy little people in a sea of distress

Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free, love me say hell yes
Low brow, but I rock a little know how

No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart, get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time, than right now
Bob Marley, poet and a prophet
Bob Marley, taught me how to off it
Bob Marley, walkin' like he talk it

Goodness me can't you see I'm gonna cough it?
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Oh, oh yeah
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now

Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
I can't tell, if I'm a king pin or a pauper

Lucky me, swimmin' in my ability
Dancin' down on life with agility
Come and drink it up, from my fertility
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility

My mom, I love her 'cause she love me
Long gone are the times, when she scrub me
Feelin' good, my brother gonna hug me
Drinkin' my juice, young love chug-a-lug me

There's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is never gonna wither
Come on everybody, time to deliver
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
I can't tell, if I'm a king pin or a pauper
What I've got, you've got to give it to your mamma
What I've got, you've got to give it to your pappa
What I've got, you've got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I've got, you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got, you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got, you've got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling, don't stop continue
Realize, I don't want to be a miser
Confide wisely, you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser?
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now...
