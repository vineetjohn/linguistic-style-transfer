Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag wavin' never meant the same
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday

Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag wavin' never meant the same
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday

Well, I've never seen us act like this
Our only hope is in minds of kids
And they'll show us a thing or two

Our only weapons are the guns of youth
It's only time before they tighten the noose
And then the hunt will be on for you

We don't need them
Cast off the crutch that kills the pain

The red flag wavin' never meant the same
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday
Cast off the crutch that kills the pain

The red flag wavin' never meant the same
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday
Like the smallest bee packs a sting

Like the pawn checkmates a King
We'll attack at the crack of dawn
Build a ladder if there's a wall

Don't be afraid to slip and fall
Speak for yourself or they'll speak for you
We don't need them

Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag wavin' never meant the same

The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday
Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag wavin' never meant the same

The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday
Like a fire, don't need water
Like a jury, needs a liar

Like a riot, don't need order
Like a madman needs a martyr
We don't need them
We don't need them

We don't need them
We don't need them
We don't need them
We don't need them

We don't need them
We don't need them
Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag wavin' never meant the same
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday
Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag wavin' never meant the same
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday
Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag wavin' never meant the same
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday
