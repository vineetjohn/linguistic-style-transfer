"No Sense"
(feat. Travis Scott)

Yeah, yeah
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you

(alright)
The sun don't set the same as you're watching it go down with me
There won't sleep the same unless you're waking up in here with me
Oh, my heart's a vacant house when you're gone away, it's so empty
And love don't make sense when it's empty (oh, no)
I've driven almost every car
It ain't the same when I'm without you, boo
Been around a million stars
None of them shine brighter than you
The sky be so dark now without you
Yeah, ooh, baby

It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
Oh, been around the world ain't the same without you
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you

Focus ain't the same if the picture ain't got you in it
And every limelight
Emotions ain't the same if it ain't about you, I don't get it
Ever since the beginning now
You had that effect on me
All I wanna do is you, boo
I mean that so literally
Don't nobody go higher than you
All of the angels must be lonely now, without you, woah

It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
'Cause I'm doing it with you, baby
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
I only want to hear your voice, yeah
Oh, been around the world, ain't the same without you
Had to find out the hard way
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
(going way up, way up)
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
(way up, way up, way up)
(yeah, slow down stay up, stay up, stay up)
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you

[Travis Scott:]
Time and time again I break a plan
Without you girl I ain't the man
Could never be all I could be
You overstand, I'm incomplete
Apparently, you gotta know I hate that
How am I supposed to take that?
Boo'd up, missing all of that
Gotta be laying in that
Rolled up, put a flame to that
Couple times you would made it back, be patient
Won't you pull up to me now, live forever young
It's amazing
I don't want to sleep unless you at home

It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
No, it don't make sense
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
No, it don't make sense, it don't make sense
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
(alright, yeah, alright)
