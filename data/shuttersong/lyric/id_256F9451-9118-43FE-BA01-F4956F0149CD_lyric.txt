Love is where this begins
Thank you for letting me in
You've always known where I stand
I've never had to pretend
And I feel my life is better
Because you're a part of it
I know without you by my side
That I would be different

Thank you for all of your trust
Thank you for not giving up
Thank you for holding my hand
You've always known where I stand
And I feel my life is better
So is the world we're living in
I'm thankful for the time I spent

With my best friend

Thank you for calling me out
Thank you for waking me up
Thank you for breaking it down
Thank you for choosing us
Thank you for all you're about
Thank you for lifting me up
Thank you for keeping me grounded
And being here now

My life is better,
Because you're a part of it
I know without you by my side
That I would be different
Yes I feel my life is better
And so is the world we're livin' in
I'm thankful for the time I spent
With my best friend

You're my best friend
