You should've known I love you
Though I'll never say it too much
Maybe you didn't get me
Maybe I'll never know what I done
Now I'm lost in the distance
You look at me like a stranger
Cause how it looks right to me
That you were scared of the danger
I could've shown you America
All the bright lights in the universe
We could have reached the highest heights
A different place a different life
Remember that night underneath the stars
For a minute I thought the world was ours
All you had to do was show me love
Yeah it's true you know we're not perfect
There's a fire inside of me
It means I'll fight for the things that are worth it
If it makes me feel complete
Cause I'm hitting rocks and I'm taking shots
I'm prepared to lose everything I've got
Now I'm lost in the distance
You look at me like a stranger
Cause how it looks right to me
That nothing can save us
I could've shown you America
All the bright lights in the universe
We could have reached the highest heights
A different place a different life
Remember that night underneath the stars
For a minute I thought the world was ours
All you had to do was show me love
Show me love love
Show me love love
Show me love show me show me love
Show me show me love
Show me Show me love
Show me Show me love
Show me love
I could've shown you America
All the bright lights in the universe
We could have reached the highest heights
A different place a different life
Remember that night underneath the stars
For a minute I thought the world was ours
All you had to do was show me love
All you had to do was show me love
