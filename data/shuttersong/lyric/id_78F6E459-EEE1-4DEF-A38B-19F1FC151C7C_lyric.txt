And we play our favorite songs
And we scream out all night long
Like ooh ooh ooh
When it's just me and my girls
All the lights, turn them off
It's too loud in here to talk
I don't understand a word you say
Gotta sleep but instead
Karaoke on the bed
Taking duck face selfies right and left
We get crazy with it, we get stupid with it
We don't care if people stare
And when we wobble with it
We get diva on it
We get queen bee on it yeah
We get britney, demi, one direction, bieber on it
And we play our favorite songs
And we scream out all night long
Like ooh ooh ooh
When it's just me and my girls
And we dance like no one's watching
We crack up, booty poppin'
Like ooh ooh ooh
When it's just me and my girls
Watch me now
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
My voice is gone, got my favorite PJ's on
Times like this don't always come along
You're all I need, there's nowhere I'd rather be
Then to have you crazy freaks with me
We get crazy with it, we get stupid with it
We don't care if people stare
And when we wobble with it
We get diva on it
We get queen bee on it yeah
We get britney, demi, one direction, bieber on it
And we play our favorite songs
And we scream out all night long
Like ooh ooh ooh
When it's just me and my girls
And we dance like no one's watching
We crack up, booty poppin'
Like ooh ooh ooh
When it's just me and my girls
Watch me now
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
Break it down
Now break it down
Now break it down
Now break it down
Now break it down
Now break it down
Now break it down
Now break it down
And we play our favorite songs
And we scream out all night long
Like ooh ooh ooh
When it's just me and my girls
And we dance like no one's watching
We crack up, booty poppin'
Like ooh ooh ooh
When it's just me and my girls
Watch me now.
