I can taste it on your mouth
And I can't leave it
You're a freak like me
Can't you see?
We can work this something out
And I'm believin'
You get off on me
It's like cheating

I, I, I, I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your makeup when you take it off
I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your clothes and watch you take them off

Take it off, take it off, take it off, baby just take it off
Take it off, take it off, take it off, baby just take it off

Put you up against the wall
Don't take it easy
You like it hard like me
It's what you need
Let's get naked and explore
Our inner secrets
For what it is
It's what it is

I, I, I, I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your makeup when you take it off
I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your clothes and watch you take them off

Take it off, take it off, take it off, baby just take it off
Take it off, take it off, take it off, baby just take it off
Take it off, take it off, take it off, baby just take it off
Take it off, take it off, take it off, baby just take it off

I just can't wait to see it all
I'm so turned on
I just can't wait to see it all
I'm so turned on

I, I, I, I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your makeup when then take it off
I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your clothes and watch you take them off
I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your makeup when you take it off
I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your clothes and watch you take them off
