You're a grand old flag
You're a high flying flag
And forever in peace may you wave
You're the emblem of
The land I love
The home of the free and the brave
Every heart beats true
¡®Neath the red white and blue
Where there's never a boast or brag
Should old acquaintance be forgot
Keep your eye on the grand old flag
The grand old flag

You're a grand old flag

The home of the free and the brave
Every heart beats true
¡®Neath the red white and blue
Where there's never a boast or brag
Should old acquaintance be forgot
Keep your eye on the grand old flag
Keep your eye on the grand old flag
Keep your eye on the grand old flag
