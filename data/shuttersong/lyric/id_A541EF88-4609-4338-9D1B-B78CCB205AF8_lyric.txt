Let's make this fleeting moment last forever...
So, tell me what you're waiting for?
I'm gonna keep it frozen here forever...
There's no regretting anymore...
It's worth the wait, even so far away...
I'm making the night mine, until the day I die!
No light to break, when you're hanging by fate...
You know what it feels like, when you're dancing blind!

All alone, just the beat inside my soul!
Take me home, where my dreams are made of gold!
In the zone, where the beat is uncontrolled!
I know what it feels like
Come on, make me feel alive!
Feel alive, feel alive
Feel alive, feel alive
Feel alive, feel alive

Alive alive alive...

Meet me under shining lights
I've been waiting right here all my life!
Feelings, you can't deny that you're living, open up your eyes!
And I just wanna sink into your crazy laughter!
Come on, make me feel, until the pain don't matter!

Every second here makes my heart beat faster!
Finally think I found what I'm chasing after!

All alone, just the beat inside my soul!
Take me home, where my dreams are made of gold!
In the zone, where the beat is uncontrolled!
I know what it feels like
Come on, make me feel alive!
Feel alive, feel alive

Feel alive, feel alive
Feel alive, feel alive
Alive alive alive...

All alone, just the beat inside my soul!
Take me home, where my dreams are made of gold!
In the zone, where the beat is uncontrolled!
I know what it feels like
Come on, make me feel alive!
Feel alive, feel alive
Feel alive, feel alive
Feel alive, feel alive
Alive alive alive...
I know what it feels like
Come on, make me feel alive!
Feel alive, feel alive
Feel alive, feel alive
Feel alive, feel alive
Alive alive alive...
