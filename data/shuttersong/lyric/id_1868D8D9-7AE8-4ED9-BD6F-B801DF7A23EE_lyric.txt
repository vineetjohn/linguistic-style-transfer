It's always around me, all this noise
But not really as loud as the voice saying
Let it happen, let it happen (It's gonna feel so good)
Just let it happen, let it happen

All this running around
Trying to cover my shadow
An ocean growing inside
All the others seem shallow
All this running around
Bearing down on my shoulders
I can hear an alarm
Must be morning

I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
And when it happens, when it happens (I'm gonna be holding on)
So let it happen, let it happen

All this running around
I can't fight it much longer
Something's trying to get out
And it's never been closer
If my ticket fails
Make up some other story
And if I never come back
Tell my lovers I'm sorry

I will not vanish and you will not scare me
Try to get through it, try to bounce to it
All the while thinking I might as well do it
They be lovin' someone and I'm not that stupid
Take the next ticket to take the next train
Why would I do it? And you wanna think that
Maybe I was ready all along
Maybe I was ready all along
Maybe I was ready all along
Maybe I was ready all along
