On the first day of Christmas
When you gave me all them kisses
Boy, you showed me things
Come hold me please, and never let me go
On the second day of Christmas
Said you felt like something's missing
So you promised me
That promise ring to keep 'til we get old, boy

On the first day of Christmas
When you gave me all them kisses
Boy, you showed me things
Come hold me please, and never let me go
On the second day of Christmas
Said you felt like something's missing
So you promised me
That promise ring to keep 'til we get old, boy

On the third day of Christmas
We got all in our feelings, said I love you and meant it, oh
On the fourth we committed
Any time, he could get it, he's the real one, I know it

Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, my true love
You are my true love
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, my true love
You are my true love
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh-oh, ah, ah)
You are my true love

On the fifth day of Christmas
You asked me what's on my wishlist
And I told you all I wanted was forever with my boo
After six days in your arms
I got that tattoo on my heart
Cause I'm your moonlight
You're my star and nothing's shining more than you, boy

You completed the vision
Now I feel like I'm living, you're so one in a million, oh
I'm so glad we committed
Any time, he could get it, he's the real one, I know it

Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love
You are my true love
You are my true love
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, my true love
You are my true love
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh-oh, ah, ah)
You are my true love
