Can you feel it?
Now it's comin' back
We can steal it
If we bridge this gap
I can see ya
Through the curtains of the waterfall

When I lost it
Yeah, you held my hand
But I tossed it
Didn't understand
You were waitin'
As I dove into the waterfall

So say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo

Can you feel
My love
Bombs away
Bombs away
Bombs away

Can you feel
My love, my love, my love, my love
Bombs away
Bombs away
Bombs away
Say Geronimo

Well we rushed it
Movin' way to fast
That we crushed it
But it's in the past
We can make this leap
Through the curtains of the waterfall

So say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo

Can you feel
My love
Bombs away
Bombs away
Bombs away

Can you feel
My love, my love, my love, my love
Bombs away
Bombs away
Bombs away

Well, I'm just a boy
With a broken toy
All lost and coy
At the curtains of the waterfall
So it's here I stand
As a broken man
But I found my friend
At the curtains of the waterfall
Now were fallin' down
Through the crashin' sound
But you come around
At the curtains of the waterfall
Yet you rush to me
And then set us free
So I fall to my knees
At the curtains of the waterfall

So say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Can you feel
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Bombs away
Bombs away
Bombs away
Say Geronimo
Make this leap
Make this leap
Make this leap
Make this leap
Can you feel
My love
