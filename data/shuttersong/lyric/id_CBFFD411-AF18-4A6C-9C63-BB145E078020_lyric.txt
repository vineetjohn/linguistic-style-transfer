Oo Oo Oooh
Oo Oo Oooh
Sleep now under my skin
Make sure you'll try to

Conjure the wind
And ease my mind
Oo Oo Oooh
Somebody call out to your brother
He's calling out your name
Ooh ooh ooh
Hiding under the covers
With no one else to blame
Ooh ooh ooh

You couldn't help out your own neighbor
You couldn't tell it to his face
You were fucked up by the blame
You cower in the corner

Confide in your father
Let it out and say
Let it pass away
Sleep now under my skin

Make sure you try to
Conjure the wind
And ease my mind
And I said
Oo Oo Oooh
Oo Oo Oooh
Somebody call out to your brother
He's calling out your name
Ooh ooh ooh
Hiding under the covers
With no one else to blame

Ooh ooh ooh
You couldn't help out your own neighbor
You couldn't tell it to his face
You were fucked up by the blame

You cower in the corner
Confide in your father
Let it out and say
You cower in the corner

Confide in your father
Let it break your day
Let it out and say
Wait there
Pull yourself out of this state dear

Acknowledge you were a fake here
From there on you might just grow
Oh oh oh
Somebody call out to your brother
He's calling out your name
Ooh ooh ooh
Hiding under the covers
With no one else to blame
Ooh ooh ooh
You couldn't help out your own neighbor
You couldn't tell it to his face
You were fucked up by the blame
