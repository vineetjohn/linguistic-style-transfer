(Woah) With out backs to the wall, the darkness will fall
We never quite thought we could loose it all.
Ready aim fire, ready aim fire
An empire's fall in just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready aim fire, ready aim fire away (fire!)
Ready aim fire, ready aim fire away
Off in the distance, there is resistance
Bubbling up and festering
Hey Mr. Motion, make me a potion
Shake it all up with your mystery
How come I've never seen your face 'round here?
I know every single face 'round here
A man on a mission, changing the vision
I was never welcome here
We don't have a choice to stay
We'd rather die than do it your way
With our backs to the wall, the darkness will fall
We never quite thought we could loose it all
Ready aim fire, ready aim fire
An empire's fall in just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready aim fire, ready aim fire away (fire!)
Ready aim fire, ready aim fire away
Back in the casing, shaking and pacing
This is the tunnel's light
Blood in the writing, stuck in the fighting
Look trough the rifle's sight
How come I've never seen your face 'round here?
I know every single face 'round here
Here in the heckle, holding the shackle
I was never welcome here
We don't have a choice to stay
We'd rather die than do it your way
With our backs to the wall, the darkness will fall
We never quite thought we could loose it all
Ready aim fire, ready aim fire
An empire's fall in just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready aim fire, ready aim fire away (fire!)
Ready aim fire, ready aim fire away
Woah With our backs to the wall, the darkness will fall
We never quite thought we could loose it all
Ready aim fire, ready aim fire
An empire's fall in just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready aim fire, ready aim fire away (fire!)
Ready aim fire, ready aim fire away
