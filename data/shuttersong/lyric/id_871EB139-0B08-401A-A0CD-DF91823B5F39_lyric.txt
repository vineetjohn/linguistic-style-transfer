Been a lot of places
I've been all around the world
Seen a lot of faces
Never knowing where I was

On the horizon
but I know, I know, I know, I know
The sun will be rising back home

Living out of cases
Ain't packing up and taking off
Made a lot of changes
But not forgetting who I was

On the horizon
Well I know, I know, I know, I know
The moon will be rising back home

Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
And the proof is in this song

I've been away for ages
But I got everything I need
I'm flicking through the pages
I've written in my memory

I feel like I'm dreaming
Oh, so I know, I know, I know, I know
That I'm never leaving, no

I won't go
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own

And the proof is in this song
Lights off when they should be on
Even stars in the skies, they're wrong
Short days when the nights are long
When I think of the things I've done
Don't matter how far I've gone

I'm always feeling like home
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong (don't forget it), home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own (never)

Never, never
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong (don't forget it), home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own (you were never)

And the proof is in this song
Home
Don't forget it
Home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own (you were never)
And the proof is in this song
Never forget it, this song
Don't forget it
No, I never forget it, this song
You were never
