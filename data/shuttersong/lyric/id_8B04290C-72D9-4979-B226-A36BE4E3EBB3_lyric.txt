Hey, said a hustler's work is never through
We makin' it 'cause we makin' moves
The only thing we know how to do
Said it's the only thing we know how to do
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard.
We work hard, play hard
Keep partyin' like it's your job
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard.
We work hard, play hard
Keep partyin' like it's your job yae...
Come on baby and drop this
Scrub that floor and just mop it
Show these gangsters how you pop lock it
Don't care what you got in your pocket
I get the way that you rockin'
Flip that thang thang don't stop it
When I just bang bang and pop it
While the club crowded just watch you (work it out)
Got a gang of cash and it's all thrown out on the bar (now work it out)
And it's going fast cuz I feel like a superstar (now work it out)
And you may not have it, I might just broke the law (now work it out)
It's your time to grab it, now make this whole thing yours (now work it out)

Some pressure that we can plush
Ladies can't get enough

And all my people with my trust
Holdin' down for my city
If they askin' you, I'm not guilty
All the thing that I'm guilty of is making you rock with me (work it out)
