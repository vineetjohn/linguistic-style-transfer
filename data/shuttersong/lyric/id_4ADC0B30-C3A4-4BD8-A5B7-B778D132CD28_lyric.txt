Hip hip 
Hip hip 

When you¡äre on a holiday 
You can¡ät find the words to say 
All the things that come to you 
And I wanna feel it too 

On an island in the sun 
We¡äll be playing and having fun 
And it makes me feel so fine 
I can¡ät control my brain 

Hip hip 
Hip hip 

When you¡äre on a golden sea 
You don¡ät need no memory 
Just a place to call your own 
As we drift into the zone 

On an island in the sun 
We¡äll be playing and having fun 
And it makes me feel so fine 
I can¡ät control my brain 

We¡äll run away together 
We¡äll spend some time forever 
We¡äll never feel that anymore
