Saturday morning jumped out of bed
And put on my best suit
Got in my car and raced like a jet, all the way to you

Knocked on your door with heart in my hand
To ask you a question
'Cause I know that you're an old fashioned man

Yeah, yeah

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
You say "I'll never get your blessing 'till the day I die
Tough luck my friend, but the answer is no!"

Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway
(Marry that girl)
Marry her anyway
(Marry that girl)
Yeah, no matter what you say
(Marry that girl)
And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so rude?

I hate to do this, you leave no choice
Can't live without her
Love me or hate me, we will be boys
Standing at that altar
Or we will run away
To another galaxy, you know
You know she's in love with me
She will go anywhere I go
¡°
Why you gotta be so rude?
¡ª Rude

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
You say "I'll never get your blessing 'till the day I die
Tough luck my friend, 'cause the answer's still no!"

Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway
(Marry that girl)
Marry her anyway
(Marry that girl)
No matter what you say
(Marry that girl)
And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so rude?
Rude

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
You say "I'll never get your blessing 'till the day I die
Tough luck my friend, but no still means no"

Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?

(Marry that girl)
Marry her anyway
(Marry that girl)
No matter what you say
(Marry that girl)
And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so rude? (Oh, yeah, oh)
Why you gotta be so rude? (Yeah)
Why you gotta be so rude?
