I've been knocked down

I've been lost

With a ground shaking under my feet

I gave it all to someone

Who said, "fire, run"

I've been, I've been through the days

When bright love turns into hate

You bend and you bend till you break

Till the lights all gone

When the one you care for takes it all

Washing you down like a waterfall

You lose the way and you hit the wall

I'll be the one, I'll be the one, I'll be the one to

Carry you home

When it hurts like you've crashed from above

Heal your broken bones

When you can't move, your heart's still locked out

You rise, you rise, you rise

Sometimes you need someone to carry you home

When it hurts like you've crashed from above

When it's true love

I've been knocked down on my own

When the water's too deep and too cold

Sleepless so many nights

With a broken heart running wild

When the one you care for takes it all

Washing you down like a waterfall

You lose the way and you hit the wall

I'll be the one, I'll be the one, I'll be the one to

Carry you home

When it hurts like you've crashed from above

Heal your broken bones

When you can't move, your heart's still locked out

You rise, you rise, you rise

Sometimes you need someone to carry you home

When it hurts like you've crashed from above

When it's true love

I'll be the one, I'll be the one, I'll be the one to

Carry you home

When it hurts like you've crashed from above

Heal your broken bones

When you can't move, your heart's still locked out

You rise, you rise, you rise

Sometimes you need someone to carry you home

When it hurts like you've crashed from above

When it's true love

I gave it all to someone

Who said "fire, run"
