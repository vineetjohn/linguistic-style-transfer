You better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list
And checking it twice
Gonna find out 
Who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

Oh You better watch out!
You better not cry
Better not pout, 
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list
And checking it twice
Gonna find out 
Who's naughty and nice

You know what?

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

A little tin horns, 
a little toy drums 
Rudy-toot-toot and rummy tum tums 
Santa Claus is coming to town 

Santa Claus is coming to town
