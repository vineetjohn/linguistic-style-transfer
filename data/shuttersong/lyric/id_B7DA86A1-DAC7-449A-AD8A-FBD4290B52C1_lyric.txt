My mind's telling me no 
But my body, my body's telling me yes 
Baby, I don't want to hurt nobody 
But there is something that I must confess to you 

I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind 
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind 
See, I know just what you want and I know just what you need girl 
So, baby, bring your body to me (bring your body here) 
I'm not fooling around with you, 
Baby, my love is true 
With you is where I wanna be, 

Girl, you need someone, someone like me, yeah 
To satisfy your every need 

You say he's not treating you right 
Lady spend the night now 
I'll love you like you need to be loved (girl, won't you try some of me?) 
No need to look no more 
Because I've opened up my doors You'll never want another love 
You'll never find another me 
You see you need someone, someone like me, yeah
