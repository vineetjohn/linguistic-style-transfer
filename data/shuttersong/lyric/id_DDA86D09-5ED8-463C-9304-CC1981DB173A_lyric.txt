There's a mountain and it's mighty high
You cannot see the top unless you fly
And there's a molehill of proven ground
There ain't nowhere to go if you hang around

Everybody wants to sell what's already been sold
Everybody wants to tell what's already been told
What's the use of money if you ain't gonna break the mold?
Even at the center of fire there is cold

All that glitters ain't gold
All that glitters ain't gold, mm

There's an ocean of despair, there are people livin' there
They're unhappy and each and every day
But hell is not fashion, so what you tryin' to say?

Everybody wants to sell what's already been sold
Everybody wants to tell what's already been told
What's the use of money if you ain't gonna break the mold?
Even at the center of fire there is cold

All that glitters ain't gold, no, no
All that glitters ain't gold, no, no

There's a lady, 99 years old
If she led a good life, heaven takes her soul
Now, that's a theory and if you don't wanna know
Step aside and make a way for those who want to go

Everybody wants to sell what's already been sold
Everybody wants to tell what's already been told
What's the use of bein' young if you ain't gonna get old?
Even at the center of fire there is cold

All that glitters ain't gold, no, no, no, no, no
All that glitters ain't gold, alright, all that glitters
All that glitters, all that glitters ain't gold

Na na na, na na, na, na na, na na
(Gold, gold, gold, gold)
Na na na, na na, na, na na, na na
(Gold, gold, gold, gold)
Gold, gold, gold

All that glitters ain't gold, gold, gold
All that glitters ain't gold, gold, gold
(Na na na, na na, na, na na, na na)

All that glitters ain't gold, gold, gold
(Na na na, na na, na, na na, na na)
All that glitters ain't gold, oh, oh yeah

One, two, one, two, three, let's go

Na na na, na na, na, na na, na na
Na na na, na na, na, na na, na na
Na na na, na na, na, na na, na na

(Na na na, na na, na, na na, na na)
You are now an official member

All that glitters ain't
