I've been knocked down, I've been lost
With a ground shaking under my feet
I gave it all to someone

Who'd said, "fire, run"

I've been, I've been through the days
When bright love turns into hate
You bend and you bend till you break
Till the lights all gone

When the one you care for just takes it all
Washing you down like a waterfall
You lose the way and you hit the wall
I'll be the one, I'll be the one, I'll be the one to

Carry you home
When it hurts like you've crashed from above
Heal your broken bones
When you can't move, your heart's still locked up

You rise, you rise, you rise
Sometimes you need someone to carry you home
When it hurts like you've crashed from above
When it's true love

I've been knocked down on my own
When the water's too deep and too cold
Sleepless so many nights
With a broken heart running wild

When the one you care for just takes it all
Washing you down like a waterfall (like a waterfall)
You lose the way and you hit the wall
I'll be the one, I'll be the one, I'll be the one to

Carry you home
When it hurts like you've crashed from above
Heal your broken bones
When you can't move, your heart's still locked up

Oh, you rise, you rise, you rise
Sometimes you need someone to carry you home
When it hurts like you've crashed from above
When it's true love

When it's true love
When it's true love, whoa
Ooh, I'll be the one, I'll be the one, I'll be the one to

Carry you home!
When it hurts like you've crashed from above (when it hurts, hey yeah)
Heal your broken bones (heal your broken bones)
When you can't move, your heart's still locked up, ooh
You rise, you rise, you rise (you rise, you rise, you rise)
Sometimes you need someone to carry you home (sometimes, you need)
When it hurts like you've crashed from above
When it's true love
I gave it all to someone
Who'd said "fire, run"
