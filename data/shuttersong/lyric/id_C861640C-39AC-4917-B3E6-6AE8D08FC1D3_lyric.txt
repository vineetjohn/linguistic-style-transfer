From my youngest years
Till this moment here
I've never seen
Such a lovely queen
From the skies above
To the deepest love
I've never felt
Crazy like this before

Paint my love
You should
Paint my love
It's the picture of
A thousand sunsets
It's the freedom of
A thousand doves

Baby you should

Paint my love
Been around the world

Then I met you girl
It's like coming home

To a place I've known
Paint my love
You should
Paint my love
It's the picture of

A thousand sunsets
It's the freedom of
A thousand doves

Baby you should
Paint my love
Since you came
Into my life
The days before all fade
To black and white

Since you came
Into my life
(Ooh, into my life)
Everything has changed

(Ooh)
Paint my love
You should
Paint my love
It's the picture of
A thousand sunsets

It's the freedom of
A thousand doves
Baby you should
Paint my love
(Paint my love)

Paint my love
You should
Paint my love
It's the picture of
A thousand sunsets
(It's the picture of)
It's the freedom of
(Ooh)
A thousand doves
Baby you should
Paint my love
Ooh
