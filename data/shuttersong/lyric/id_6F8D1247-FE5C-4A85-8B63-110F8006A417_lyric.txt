Come on
Natalie La Rose
I wanna rock with somebody
I wanna take shots with somebody
I wanna leave with somebody
And we ain't gonna tell nobody we ain't gonna tell nobody
Walk in everybody knows what's good
But some gonna hate what's new
We just do our thing no time to waste
Always play it cool
And at the end of the night when the lights go out
Will we turn down Oh no we won't
We ain't never turnin' down we ain't never turnin' down
And when they try to make us leave
We turn and say we never going home
And you know just what I wanna do
I wanna rock with somebody
I wanna take shots with somebody
I wanna leave with somebody
And we ain't gotta tell nobody we ain't gotta tell nobody
Walk in everybody know what's good
We're our only plug
Bring us everything we think we need
Tonight is goin' up
Tonight is goin' up
And at the end of the night when the lights go out
Will we turn down Oh no we won't
We ain't never turnin' down we ain't never turnin' down
And when they try to make us leave
We turn and say we never going home
And you know just what I wanna do
I wanna rock with somebody
I wanna take shots with somebody
I wanna leave with somebody
And we ain't gotta tell nobody we ain't gotta tell nobody
In the club like what
We be in the party in the club like what
And the club like
We be in the city going dumb like what
In the club like what
We be in the party in the club like what
We be in the city going dumb like what
We be in the party in the club like what
And at the end of the night when the lights go out
Will we turn down Oh no we won't
We ain't never turnin' down we ain't never turnin' down
And when they try to make us leave
We turn and say we never going home
And you know just what I wanna do
I wanna rock with somebody
I wanna take shots with somebody
I wanna leave with somebody
And we ain't gotta tell nobody we ain't gotta tell nobody
