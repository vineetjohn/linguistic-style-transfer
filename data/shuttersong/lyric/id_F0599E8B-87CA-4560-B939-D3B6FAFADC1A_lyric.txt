Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most
When you broke down, I didn't leave you
I stayed by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most

I gave you attention when nobody else was paying (Hmm)
I gave you the shirt off my back
What you saying? To keep you warm
I showed you the game
Everybody else was playing
That's for sure

And I was on my knees when
Nobody else was praying, Oh lord

Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most
When you broke down, I didn't leave you

I stayed by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most

I gave you my heart when you said
Yours was broken, yes I did
I gave you the key when the door
Wasn't open, just admit it

See I gave you faith, turned your
Doubt into hoping, can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys
Turn to moping
Tell me... Where are you now
That I need you? Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need you?
Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down, I didn't leave you
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
I need you the most
