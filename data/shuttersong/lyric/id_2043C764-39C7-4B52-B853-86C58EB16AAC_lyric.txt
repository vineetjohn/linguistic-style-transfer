Do I Wanna Know - Arctic Monkeys
 
Have you got colour in your cheeks 
Do you ever get that fear
That you can't shift the tide
That sticks around like something in your teeth 
Hiding some aces up your sleeve
Have you no idea that you're in deep 
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep 
Cause there's this tune
I found that makes me think of you somehow
And I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee
 
(Do I wanna know )
If this feeling flows both ways
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things
That you can't say tomorrow day
 
Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few 
Cause I always do
Well baby I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
 
Crawling back to you
 
So have you got the guts 
Been wondering if your heart's still open
And if so I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt it's just
I'm constantly on the cusp of trying to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to
 
(Do I wanna know )
If this feeling flows both ways
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things
That you can't say tomorrow day
 
Crawling back to you
 
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few 
(calling when you've had a few)
'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)
Baby I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
Crawling back to you
 
(Do I wanna know )
If this feeling flows both ways
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things
That you can't say tomorrow day
(Yeah)
 
(Do I wanna know )
Too busy being yours to fall
(Sad to see you go)
Ever thought of calling down 
(Baby we both know)
Do you want me crawling back to you
