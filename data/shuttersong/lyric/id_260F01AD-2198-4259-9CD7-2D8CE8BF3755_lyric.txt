Across the ocean, across the sea
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face
I need to look in your eyes

Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps on the road and upside down now
I know it's hard, babe, to sleep at night
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Through the long nights

And the bright lights
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Through the long nights

And the bright lights
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
All alone, in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms, holding my heart
Oh I
Oh I
I love you
And everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
You know that I care for you
I'll always be there for you
I promise I will stay right here, yeah
I know that you want me too
Baby we can make it through anything
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Through the long nights
And the bright lights
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Through the long nights
And the bright lights
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
