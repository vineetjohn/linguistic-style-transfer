I know you got all dressed up for the club,
Waiting on them to come pick you up,
Baby, when I saw ya walking out the door,
I just knew ya needed something more,
Now whip it straight back to the crib,
Finna give you something that you won't forget.

Baby, I just wanna get you out them clothes,
I just wanna see you dance in slow motion.

We can take, we can take, we can take our time, baby.
In slow motion,
We can take, we can take, we can take our time, stay here.
In slow motion.

So shawty let your hair down, take a sip,
Go and put this joint between your lips,
Baby, why don't you make yourself comfortable,
While I go and put this tongue on you,
So tell me when you ready,
I'ma speed it up for you just for a second,
Just for a second,
Then I'ma slow it back down and keep it steady.

Now that you are out them clothes,
I just wanna see you dance in slow motion.

We can take, we can take, we can take our time, baby.
In slow motion,
We can take, we can take, we can take our time, stay here.
In slow motion.

Oh darling, I just wanna get you out them clothes,
I just wanna see you dance in slow motion.

We can take, we can take, we can take our time, baby.
In slow motion,
We can take, we can take, we can take our time, stay here,
In slow motion,
We can take, we can take, we can take our time baby,
In slow motion,
We can take, we can take, we can take our time, stay here.
