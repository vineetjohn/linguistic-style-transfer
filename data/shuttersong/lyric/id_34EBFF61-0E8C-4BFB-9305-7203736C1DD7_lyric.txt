"Just The Way You Are (Remix)"
(feat. Lupe Fiasco)

[Intro - Lupe Fiasco:]
First rule, never let em change you
Rule two, do you to the fullest
And never be ashamed to
Your just good at what they can¡¯t do
And they hate that, they wanna paint you
In they color, put you on another
But what they don¡¯t accept, and what they don¡¯t see
The best thing is what you already be

[Bruno Mars:]
Oh her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they¡¯re not shining
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying

She¡¯s so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah I know, I know
When I compliment her
She wont believe me
And its so, its so
Sad to think she don¡¯t see what I see

But every time she asks me do I look okay
I say

When I see your face
There¡¯s not a thing that I would change
Cause you¡¯re amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile,
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl you¡¯re amazing
Just the way you are

Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she¡¯d let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think its so sexy

She¡¯s so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Oh you know, you know, you know
I¡¯d never ask you to change
If perfect is what you¡¯re searching for
Then just stay the same

So don¡¯t even bother asking
If you look okay
You know I¡¯ll say

When I see your face
There¡¯s not a thing that I would change
Cause you¡¯re amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile,
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl you¡¯re amazing
Just the way you are

[Lupe Fiasco:]
Uh yeah
The definition of real is
If you don¡¯t feel then you don¡¯t you feel it
Don¡¯t conceal it, don¡¯t be fair
You look great only silicon will bill it
A botox to kill it
You just killin off spirit
And you the one that you gotta live with
So don¡¯t get caught up in appearance
And see the inner beauty
When you look off in the mirrors

[Bruno Mars:]
The way you are
The way you are
Girl you¡¯re amazing
Just the way you are

When I see your face
There¡¯s not a thing that I would change
Cause you¡¯re amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile,
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl you¡¯re amazing
Just the way you are
