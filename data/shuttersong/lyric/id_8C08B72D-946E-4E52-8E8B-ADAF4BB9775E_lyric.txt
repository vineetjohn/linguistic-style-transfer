50 lines
50 crying all the time's
50 boys
50 lies
50 I'm gonna change my mind's
I changed my mind
I changed my mind
Now I feel indifferent

We were young
We were young
We were young we didn't care
Is it gone
Is it gone
Is it floating in the air?
I changed my mind
I changed my mind
Now I feel indifferent

All that time, wasted
I wish I was a little more delicate
I wish my
I wish my
I wish my
I wish my
I wish my name was Clementine
