Love, love is like a stubborn youth
That you'd rather just deny
I'm walking on a broken roof
While I'm looking at the sky

It's all false love and affection
You don't want me
You just like the attention
Yes it's all false love and affection
You don't like me
You just want the attention

Love, love is like a stubborn youth

It's all false love and affection
You don't want me
You just like the attention
Yes it's all false love and affection
You don't like me
You just want the attention

I'm not your toy
This isn't another girl meets boy
I'm not your toy
This isn't another girl meets boy
I'm not your toy
This isn't another girl meets boy
I'm not your toy
This isn't another girl meets boy

Love, love hides in a smoky light
I can never find the truth
Boy, your touches leave me mystified
I wish I could believe in you

Yes it's all false love and affection
You don't want me
You just like the attention
Yes it's all false love and affection
You don't like me
You just want the attention
