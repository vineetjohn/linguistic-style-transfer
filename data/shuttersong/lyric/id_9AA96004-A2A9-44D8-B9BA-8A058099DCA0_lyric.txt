All I wanna do when I wake up in the morning is see your eyes
Rosanna, Rosanna
I never thought that a girl like you could ever care for me, Rosanna

All I wanna do in the middle of the evening is hold you tight
Rosanna, Rosanna
I didn't know you were looking for more than I could ever be

Not quite a year since she went away, Rosanna, yeah
Now she's gone and I have to say

Meet you all the way
Meet you all the way, Rosanna, yeah
Meet you all the way
Meet you all the way, Rosanna, yeah

I can see your face still shining through the window on the other side
Rosanna, Rosanna
I didn't know that a girl like you could make me feel so sad, Rosanna

All I wanna tell you is now you'll never ever have to compromise
Rosanna, Rosanna
I never thought that losing you could ever hurt so bad

Not quite a year since she went away, Rosanna, yeah
Now she's gone and I have to say

Meet you all the way
Meet you all the way, Rosanna, yeah
Meet you all the way
Meet you all the way, Rosanna, yeah

Not quite a year since she went away
Who is it? Rosanna, yeah
Now she's gone and I have to say
Meet you all the way
Meet you all the way, Rosanna, yeah
Meet you all the way
Meet you all the way, Rosanna, yeah
Meet you all the way
Meet you all the way, Rosanna, yeah
Meet you all the way
Meet you all the way, Rosanna, yeah
