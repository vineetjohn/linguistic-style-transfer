Is Mercury in retrograde or is that the excuse
That I've always made
'Cause I wanna blame you
But I can only blame myself
Yeah it's easy to throw you under the bus
I'll call you crazy
While I'm filling my cup
I say these things to hurt you
But I only hurt myself
Oh I can only take responsability for me
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it
I'm not that innocent oh yeah
It takes two two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first baby to say "I'm sorry"
I face my demons yeah
I paid my dues
I had to grow up
I wish you could too
I wanted to save you
But I can only save myself
Oh I can only be the changing one to see
Yeah I can see
It takes two two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it
I'm not that innocent oh yeah
It takes two two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first baby to say "I'm sorry"
I point my finger but it does me no good
I look in the mirror and it tells me the truth yeah
Why all these lessons always learned the hard way
Is it too late to change
It takes two two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it I'm not that innocent oh
It takes two two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first baby to say "I'm sorry"
