Pain - Three Days Grace

Pain, without love
Pain, I can't get enough

Pain, I like it rough

'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all

You're sick of feeling down

You're not the only one

I'll take you by the hand

And I'll show you a world that you can understand

This life is filled with hurt

When happiness doesn't work

Trust me and take my hand

When the lights go out you will understand

Pain, without love

Pain, I can't get enough

Pain, I like rough

'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all

Pain, without love

Pain, I can't get enough

Pain, I like rough

'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all

Anger and agony

Are better than misery
 a plan

When the lights go off you will understand

Pain, without love

Pain, I can't get enough

Pain, I like rough

'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all

Pain, without love
Pain, I can't get enough

Pain, I like rough

'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing

Rather feel pain

I know (I know I know I know I know)

That you're wounded

You know (You know you know you know you know)

That I'm here to save you

You know (You know you know you know you know)

I'm always here for you

I know (I know I know I know I know)

That you'll thank me later

Pain, without love

Pain, can't get enough

Pain, I like rough

'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all

Pain, without love

Pain, I can't get enough

Pain, I like rough

'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all

Pain, without love

Pain, I can't get enough

Pain, I like rough

'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all

Rather feel pain than nothing at all

Rather feel pain
