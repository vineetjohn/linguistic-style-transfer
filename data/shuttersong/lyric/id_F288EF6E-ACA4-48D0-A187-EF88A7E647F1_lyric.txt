Never said any of this was gonna be simple
Sometimes all it takes is just a simple oh-oh-oh
Because the place you want to reach is right in front of you
You're getting stronger
So just keep on that bit longer
Rap-pa-pum

Girl come over
Me want you closer
I'm tired of the rainy days

You bring me
Sun, sun, sun, sun-shine
You bring me
Sun, sun, sun, sun-shine

So before the nights over
I want you to know that
I'm willing to change my ways

You bring me
Sun, sun, sun, sun-shine
You bring me
Sun, sun, sun, sun-shine

Come over, Come over
Come over, C-Come over
Come over, Come over
Come over, C-Come over

I guess you're gonna run out luck love, sooner or later
You better make time to sit down and put pen to paper oh-oh-oh
Because the things you want to do will slip away from you
It won't be long now
So just keep on being strong now
Rap-pa=pum

Look at my style
Me hear them saying 'l'm sorry girl'
And both times no one feels to stay the night over
Nineteen days pass since I last see the girl
Be at the bedroom over, got no fight over

Regular she cuss me
Tell her friends, then mos, how she no trusts me
Well if I saw you down from here, let me pay
Since the last three months, you know you want me

Me won't pick up me phone, no dial-dial-oo
Don't put pressure on me, I'll ask you
Here baby let me love you, you know I wan't some
No me wish you know about my, my manual
