I gave you the key when the door wasn't open, just admit it
See I gave you faith turned your doubt in to hoping, can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me here, where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down I didn't leave ya
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?

I gave you attention when nobody else was payin'
I gave you the shirt off my back what you sayin'
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playin', that's for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was prayin', oh lord

Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you the most
