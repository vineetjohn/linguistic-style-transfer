Made a meal and threw it up on Sunday
I've got a lot of things to learn
Said I would and I'll be leaving one day
Before my heart starts to burn.

So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new... Don't you know
The cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away

Times are hard when things have got no meaning
I've found a key upon the floor
Maybe you and I will not believe in the things we find behind the door

So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new... Don't you know
The cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away

Stand by me (nobody knows the way it's gonna be)
Stand by me (nobody knows the way it's gonna be)
Stand by me (nobody knows the way it's gonna be)
Stand by me (nobody knows, yeah, nobody knows the way it's gonna be)

If you're leaving will you take me with you
I'm tired of talking on my phone
There is one thing I can never give you
My heart will never be your home

So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new... Don't you know
The cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away

Stand by me (nobody knows the way it's gonna be)
Stand by me (nobody knows the way it's gonna be)
Stand by me (nobody knows the way it's gonna be)
Stand by me (nobody knows, yeah, nobody knows the way it's gonna be)
The way it's gonna be, yeah

Maybe I can see, yeah... Don't you know
The cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away

Hey, hey!

Stand by me (nobody knows the way it's gonna be)
Stand by me (nobody knows the way it's gonna be)
Stand by me (nobody knows the way it's gonna be)
Stand by me (nobody knows, yeah, nobody knows the way it's gonna be)
