Dear No One - Tori Kelly
I like being independent
Not so much of an investment
No one to tell me what to do
I like being by myself
Don't gotta entertain anybody else
No one to answer to
But sometimes I just want somebody to hold
Someone to give me their jacket when its cold
Got that young love even when we're old
Yeah sometimes I want someone to grab my hand
Pick me up pull me close be my man
I will love you till the end
So if you're out there I'd swear to be good to you
But I'm done lookin' for my future someone
Cause when the time is right
You'll be here but for now
Dear no one this is your love song
I don't really like big crowds
I tend to shut people out
I like my space yeah
But I'd love to have a soul mate
And God give him to me someday
And I know it'll be worth the wait
So if you're out there I swear to be good to you
But I'm done lookin for my future someone
Cause when the time is right
You'll be here but for now
Dear no one this is your love song
But sometimes I just want somebody to hold
Someone to give me their jacket when its cold
Got that young love even when we're old
Yeah sometimes I want someone to grab my hand
Pick me up pull me close be my man
I will love you till the end
So if you're out there I swear to be good to you
But I'm done lookin for my future someone
Cause when the time is right
You'll be here but for now
Dear no one this is your love song
Dear no one
Dear no one
Dear no one
Dear no one this is your love song
