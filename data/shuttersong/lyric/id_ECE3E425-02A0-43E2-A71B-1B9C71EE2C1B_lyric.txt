Freak (feat. Pitbull) - Enrique 
Mr  Worldwide
Let's go
I tried to let it go
But I'm addicted to your chemicals
I got a piece  I want an overdose
I love the way she gets so physical
Fucks like an animal
In night  I just imagine how you put your love on me
Lights off  lightd on
Ready for some action
Baby  come and give it to me
Cause I'm a freak
The way you're popping and dropping
All over me
No  I don't want you to stop it
Yeah  I'm a freak
Baby  I can't lie
When you move like that
I got a one track mark
Cause I'm a freak
Yeah  I'm a freak
Cause I'm a freak
Yeah  I'm a freak
Yeah  baby there you go
Stealing my heart just like a criminal
No turning back  this time is critical
You move your body like a miracle
Baby  here we go
In night  I just imagine how you put your love on me
Lights off  lightd on
Ready for some action
Baby  come and give it to me
Cause I'm a freak
The way you're poppin' and dropping
All over me
No  I don't want you to stop it
Yeah  I'm a freak
Baby  I can't lie
When you move like that
I got a one track mark
Cause I'm a freak
Yeah  I'm a freak
Cause I'm a freak
Yeah  I'm a freak
Baby you pop and lock it
Drop it  I watch it for sure
Baby you rollin and rocking
Move it  I use it  let's go
You know I leak it and do the things that they make you explode
You don't believe me  mami 
Just let me go low
Because I'm a freak  that's a no
Now can I get big  big  big  baby back it up nice and slow
I just wanna skip  skip  skip  ride out and go
I came  I saw  I conquered  on to the next  let's go
Cause I'm a freak
The way you're popping and dropping
All over me
No  I don't want you to stop it
Yeah  I'm a freak
Baby  I can't lie
When you move like that
I got a one track mark
Cause I'm a freak
Yeah  I'm a freak
Cause I'm a freak
Yeah  I'm a freak
It's The Cataracs
From the hotel room to the DJ booth
On the bathroom seat  yes  I'm just a freak
An when the sun goes down  gotta let it out
Baby don't blame me  I'm just a freak
