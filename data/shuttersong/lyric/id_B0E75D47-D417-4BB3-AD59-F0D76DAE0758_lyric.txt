When I met you in the summer
Took my heart a beat sound
We fell in love
As they leaves turned brown
And we could be together baby
Long the skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you like so soon
When I met you in the summer

When I met you in the summer
Took my heart a beat sound
We fell in love
As they leaves turned brown
And we could be together baby
Long the skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you like so soon
When I met you in the summer

When I met you in the summer
Summer...
