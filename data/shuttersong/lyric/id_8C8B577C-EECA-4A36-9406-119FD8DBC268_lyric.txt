I'm at a stage in my life where I feel like I can conquer anything and everything

Sipping on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Balling in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor cause I been drinking that dirty
Bring that ace, bought a case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup I drink with me

Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing

And you know what I need from you when I get home
You better not be on the phone
Talking up a storm like you usually do
Talking up your friends like you usually do
Telling them I never spend time with you
It's hard to find a time we been

Sipping on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Balling in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor cause I been drinking that dirty
Bring that ace, bought a case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup I drink with me

Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing

I'm familiar with this cash flow
And if you juggin' you can vouch for me
I did it my way, you could vouch for me
I put the cocaine in the powder in the couch homie
Whenever I step outside the house I keep that glockie on me
Bad bitches wanna come buy the paparazzi on me
I got so many bad bitches that I barely wanna
I'm barely paying attention, baby I need substance
I know you spend some time putting on some makeup and your outfit but

Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing

You doing me dirty
You doing me dirty
You doing me dirty
You doing me dirty
You know
How we let it get like this I don't know
But that nigga can't save your soul, nah
Doing me dirty, you doing me dirty
Haven't a nigga heard from you
How can you live with yourself
Haven't even heard from you
How can you live with yourself
Ungrateful, ungrateful
Your momma be ashamed of you
I haven't even heard from you, not a single word from you
Ungrateful
I'm too good for you, too good for you
You should go back to a perfect match for you, unstable
Doing me dirty (dirty, dirty)
You're making me nervous
I haven't even heard from you
You look drained, you look exhausted
Girl them late nights ain't good for you
Really starting to show on you
Don't hit me up when it's good for you
Ungrateful
