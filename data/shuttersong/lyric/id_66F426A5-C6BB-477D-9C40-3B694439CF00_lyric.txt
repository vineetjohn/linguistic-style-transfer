Days like these
I just want you back
I can't breathe
I can't even speak
No, la la la la la la la la la

Gotta rise
Gotta fight
Cause it's something I wanted
Oh, he's gotta go
I can see in the light
It's not right
Now I know
I don't need him

Ohh, let your body talk
Even when it feels so lost
Spinning when the tears
They fall, you gotta just let it go

La la la la la la la la la

Days like these
I don't want you back
Now I feel free
Gonna keep it like that, yeah

Gotta rise
Gotta fight
Cause it's something I wanted
Ohh, he's gotta go
I can see in the light
It's not right
Now I know
I don't need him

Ooh, let your body talk
Even when it feels so lost
Spinning when the tears
They fall, you gotta just let it go

Ohh, let your body talk
Even when it feels so lost
Spinning when the tears

They fall, you gotta just let it go
Ehh
Ehh
Ehh

Ehh
Days like these
I can even speak like
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Ohh, let your body talk
Even when it feels so lost
Spinning when the tears
They fall, you gotta just let it go
Ohh, let your body talk
Even when it feels so lost
Spinning when the tears
They fall, you gotta just let it go
Let your body talk!
