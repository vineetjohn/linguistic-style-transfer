What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing?
Would the song still survive without 5 golden rings?
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe?
What would happen if God never let it snow?
What would happen if Christmas Carols told a lie?
Tell me what would you find?

You'd say that today holds something special
Something holy and not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

What if angels did not pay attention to
All the things that we wish they would always do?
What if happiness came in a cardboard box?
Then I'd think there was something we all forgot
What would happen if presents all went away?
Tell me, what would you find?

You'd say that today holds something special
Something holy and not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

We get so caught up in all of it
Business and relationships, 100 mile an hour lives
And it's this time of year and everybody's here
It seems the last thing on your mind

It's that the day holds something special
Something holy and not superficial
So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
But here's something you should know that is for sure

Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something more
There's gotta be more
There's gotta be more
