Yo, okay
All my niggas with me
All my niggas with it
All my niggas balling
All my niggas athletic
All my niggas A1
All got street cred
All my niggas balling
All my niggas athletic
Pulled up in the phantom
Pulled off with a dancer
Got a pocket full of money
Kinda hard to keep my pants up
Nigga tryna run them bands up
Fuck a bitch with my hands up
Lil Que fucked the Xans up
Kinda hard to understand her
Duffle bags in the Escalade
Call the bitch there a bread truck
Got the bitch going retarded
Call uber for a spare truck
All these niggas never scared us
All these niggas never ran up
Bitch tryna put the head on me
Niggas tryna put the feds on me
Niggas tryna take meds on me
Everything for the players only
Niggas sunny like Arizona
Gunshots just for saying something
Spraying shit like aerosol
You a foul and that's a fair ball
Nigga can't reach the goal
Keep shooting that there air ball

Watch out lil bitch

Watch out lil ho
My partners still smoke on parole
They say that I'm crazy
I used to talk to a stove
I tell it to lock, shit I tell it a lot
Go to the dealership, fishtail off the lot
You know I'm coming straight up the block
You know I'm coming straight out the top
Shawty said she want 5 million
Cause I told her to leave and call her a thot
Shit, you can like it or not, damn
I'm coming straight out the pot, yam
Still got some eq in my stock, man
Nigga I ain't gotta lie, lie
Nigga I ain't gotta try, try
You waving that thing in the sky, sky
We waving that thing at your body, body
We waving that thing at your eye, eye
Look at the watch on my wrist, wrist
Yeah I don't mind watching my wrist, wrist
Told that lil bitch I'll pass, pass

Nigga watch the assist, swish
I run the track like the marathon

You niggas softer than silicone

You know what it's like when the feeling gone

I know what it's like when the ceiling gone
I had a sit down with Farrakhan

Turn the White House to the Terror Dome

I used to serve at the chevron
I used to serve with my necklace on, bitch

Watch out lil bitch
Watch out lil bitch
Watch out lil bitch
Watch out lil bitch
You getting mad
I'm getting rich
You getting mad
And I'm getting rich
Watch out lil bitch
