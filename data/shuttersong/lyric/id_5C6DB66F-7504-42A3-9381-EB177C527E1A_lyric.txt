I used to be so happy
But without you here I feel so low
I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
It's buried deep inside me but I feel there's something you should know

I will never forget you
You'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side 'til the day I die

'Til the day I die
('til the day I die)

'Til the day I die
('til the day I die)

Funny how we both end up here but everything seems alright
I wonder what will happen
If we went back and put up a fight
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
So what in this world do you think
could ever take you off my mind
(take you off my mind)
I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side 'til the day I die

Feeling it, loving it
Everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had something special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
But I'm still tired and I can't hide my connection with you

Feeling it, loving it

'Til the day I die...

'Til the day I die...
'Til the day I die...
'Til the day I die...

'Til the day I die...
'Til the day I die...
'Til the day I die...

I will never forget you...

I will never, never, never, never
never, never, never, never...

I will never forget you...

'Til the day I die.
