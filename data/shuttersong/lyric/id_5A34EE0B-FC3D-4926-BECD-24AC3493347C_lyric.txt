Say it's true, there's nothing like me and you
I'm not alone, tell me you feel it too

And I would run away
I would run away, yeah..., yeah
I would run away
I would run away with you

Cause I am falling in love with you
No never I'm never gonna stop
Falling in love with you

Close the door, lay down upon the floor
And by candlelight, make love to me through the night
(through the night, through the night...)

Cause I have run away
I have run away, yeah..., yeah
I have run away, run away
I have run away with you

Cause I am falling in love (falling in love) with you
No never I'm never gonna stop
Falling in love with you...
With you...

My Love
With You...
And I would runaway
I would runaway, yeah..., yeah

I would runaway (runaway)
I would runaway with you
Cause I am falling in love (falling in love) with you
No never I'm never gonna stop
Falling in love with you...
Falling in love (falling in love) with you
No never I'm never gonna stop falling in love with you
