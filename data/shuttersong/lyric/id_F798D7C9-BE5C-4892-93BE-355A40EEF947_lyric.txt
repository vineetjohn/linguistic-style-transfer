Face down on a broken street
There's a man in the corner in a pool of misery.
I'm in a white van as a red sea covers the ground
Metal crash I can't tell what it is
But I take a look and now I'm sorry I did.
5: 30 on a Friday night 33 good people cut down

I don't believe anymore
I don't believe anymore

Face down on a pillow of shame
There are some girls with a needle tryin to spell my name
My body's not a canvas
My body's now a toilet wall.

I don't believe anymore
I don't believe anymore

Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
Raised by wolves
We were raised by wolves
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
If I open my eyes,
You disappear

Boy sees his father crushed under the weight
Of a cross in a passion where the passion is hate.
Blue mink Ford, I'm gonna detonate in your den
Blood in the house,
Blood on the street
The worst things in the world are justified by belief
Registration 1385-WZ

I don't believe anymore
I don't believe anymore

Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
Raised by wolves
We were raised by wolves
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
If I open my eyes,
You disappear
