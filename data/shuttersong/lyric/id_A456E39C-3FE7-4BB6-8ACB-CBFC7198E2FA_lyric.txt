I was pulling out my hair the day I got the deal
Chemically calm
Was I meant to feel happy
That my life was just about to change?

One life pretending to be
The cat who got the cream
Oh, everybody said,
"Marina is a dreamer."
People like to tell you what you're gonna be
It's not my problem if you don't see what I see
And I do not give a damn if you don't believe
My problem, it's my problem
That I never am happy
It's my problem, it's my problem
On how fast I will succeed

Are you satisfied with an average life?
Do I need to lie to make my way in life?

High achiever don't you see
Baby, nothing comes for free
They say I'm a control freak
Driven by a greed to succeed
Nobody can stop me

Cause it's my problem
If I wanna pack up and run away
It's my business if I feel the need to
Smoke and drink and sway
It's my problem, it's my problem
If I feel the need to hide
And it's my problem if I have no friends
And feel I want to die

Are you satisfied with an average life?
Do I need to lie to make my way in life?

Are you satisfied with an easy ride
Once you cross the line
Will you be satisfied?

Sad inside
In this life
Unsatisfied praying
Sad inside
In this life
Unsatisfied waiting

Are you satisfied with an average life
Do I need to lie to make my way in life

Are you satisfied with an easy ride
Once you cross the line
Will you be satisfied?

Black, white
(Are you satisfied, are you satisfied?)
Black, white
(Are you satisfied, are you satisfied?)
Black, white
(Are you satisfied, are you satisfied?)
Black, white
(Are you satisfied, are you satisfied?)
