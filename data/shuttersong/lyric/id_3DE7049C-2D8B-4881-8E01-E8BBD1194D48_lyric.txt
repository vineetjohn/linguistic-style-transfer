She says, "I'm walking in a straight line"
But that's not really her style
And they all got the same heartbeat
But her's is falling behind

Nothing in this world could
Ever bring them down
Yeah, they're invincible
And she's just in the background

And she says, 
I wish that I could be like the cool kids,
'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids

He says, "I'm talking with a big smile"
But they haven't got a clue
Yeah, they live in the good life
Can't see what he is going through

They're driving fast cars
But they don't know where they're going
In the fast lane
Living life without knowing

And he says,
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids

I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to get it
I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids

Hey, 
Ooh
Cool kids, cool kids, cool kids
Cool kids, cool kids, cool kids

And they said,
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids

I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids

I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to get it
I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids

Yeah
Cool kids, cool kids
Yeah
I wish, I wish, I wish
