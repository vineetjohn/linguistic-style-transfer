"I Would"
 
Lately I found myself thinking
Been dreaming about you a lot
And up in my head I'm your boyfriend
But that's one thing you've already got
 
He drives to school every morning
While I walk alone in the rain
He'd kill me without any warning
If he took a look in my brain
 
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E 
Well if it was me then I would (I would)
Would he hold you when you're feeling low 
Baby you should know that I would (I would)
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E 
Well if it was me then I would (I would)
Would he hold you when you're feeling low 
Baby you should know that I would
 
Back in my head we were kissing
I thought things were going alright
With a sign on my back saying 'kick me'
Reality ruined my life
 
Feels like I'm constantly playing
A game that I'm destined to lose
'Cause I can't compete with your boyfriend
He's got 27 tattoos
 
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E 
Well if it was me then I would (I would)
Would he hold you when you're feeling low 
Baby you should know that I would (I would)
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E 
Well if it was me then I would (I would)
Would he hold you when you're feeling low 
Baby you should know that I would (I would  I would)
 
Would he please you 
Would he kiss you 
Would he treat you like I would (I would) 
Would he touch you 
Would he need you 
Would he love you like I would 
 
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E 
Well if it was me then I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low 
Baby you should know that I would
 
Would he please you  Would he please you 
Would he kiss you  Would he kiss you 
Would he treat you like I would  (like I would)
Would he touch you  Would he touch you 
Would he need you  Would he need you 
Would he love you like I would 
 
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E 
Well if it was me then I would (I would)
Would he hold you when you're feeling low 
Baby you should know that I would  I would  yeah  I would  yeah
