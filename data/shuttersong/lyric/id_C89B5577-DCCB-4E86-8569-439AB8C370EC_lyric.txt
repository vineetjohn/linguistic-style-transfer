I come home in the morning light
My mother says when you gonna live your life right?
Oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones
And girls they want to have fun
Oh girls just want to have fun

The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells what you gonna do with your life?
Oh daddy dear you know you're still number one
But girls they want to have fun
Oh girls just want to have -

That's all they really want 
Some fun
When the working day is done, oh
Girls - they want to have fun
Oh girls just want to have fun

Girls, they want
Wanna have fun
Girls
Wanna have 

Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I want to be the one to walk in the sun
Oh girls they want to have fun
Oh girls just want to have 

That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Girls - they want to have fun
Oh girls just want to have fun,

Girls, they want
Wanna have fun
Girls
Wanna have 

They just wanna
They just wanna
