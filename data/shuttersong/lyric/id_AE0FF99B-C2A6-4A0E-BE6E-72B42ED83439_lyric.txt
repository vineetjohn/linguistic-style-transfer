Swinging in the backyard
Pull up in your fast car
Whistling my name.

Open up a beer
And you say get over here
And play a video game.

I'm in his favorite sun dress
Watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown.

I say you the bestest
Lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on.

Go play a video game

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you,
Baby, now you do.

Singing in the old bars
Swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame

Kissing in the blue dark
Playing pool and wild darts,
Video games.

He holds me in his big arms
Drunk and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of

Watching all our friends fall
In and out of 'Old Paul's'
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games.

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew.
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you,
Baby now you do.

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby now you do,
Now you do.
