Yeah
Ya'll know what it is
Katy Perry
Juicy J, aha
Let's rage

I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
'Cause I'm capable of anything
Of anything and everything

Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse

(Hey)
Are you ready for, ready for
(Hey)
A perfect storm, a perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
(Hey)

There's no going back

Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
If you choose to walk away, don't walk away

It's in the palm of your hand now baby
It's a yes or no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it up to me
Up to me, give it up to me

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse

Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, a perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
(love trippin')

There's no going back

Oh
She's a beast
I call her Karma
(Come back)
She eat your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer
(Woo)

Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart was on steroids
'Cause her love was so strong

You may fall in love
When you meet her
(Meet her)
If you get the chance you better keep her
(Keep her)

She's sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She'll turn cold as a freezer
(Freezer)

That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I'm gon' put her in a coma
(Woo)

Damn I think I love her
Shawty so bad
I'm sprung and I don't care
She got me like a roller coaster
Turn the bedroom into a fair
(A fair)

Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil' mama so dope
I messed around and got addicted

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
(You should know)

Baby do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse
(Like a dark horse)

Are you ready for, ready for
(Ready for)

A perfect storm, a perfect storm
(A perfect storm)

'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
(Mine)

There's no going back
