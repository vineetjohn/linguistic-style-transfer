Every time our eyes meet
This feeling inside me
Is almost more than I can take
Baby, when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away

I've never been this close to anyone or anything
I can hear your thoughts, I can see your dreams
I don't know how you do what you do

I'm so in love with you

It just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side

Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do

Baby, I'm amazed by you
The smell of your skin

The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark
Your hair all around me

Baby, you surround me
You touch every place in my heart
Oh, it feels like the first time every time
I wanna spend the whole night in your eyes
I don't know how you do what you do

I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better

I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side

Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby, I'm amazed by you
Every little thing that you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Oh, every little thing that you do
Baby, I'm amazed by you
