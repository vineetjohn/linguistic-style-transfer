What do you mean
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean
What do you mean
Said we're running out of time what do you mean
What do you mean
Better make up your mind
What do you mean
You're so indecisive of what I'm saying
Trying to catch the beat make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end where do I start
First you wanna go left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day make love all night
First you up and you're down and then between
Oh I really want to know
What do you mean
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean
What do you mean
Said we're running out of time what do you mean
What do you mean
Better make up your mind
What do you mean
You're overprotective when I'm leaving
Trying to compromise but I can't win
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching
You had me from the start won't let this end
First you wanna go left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day make love all night
First you up and you're down and then between
Oh I really want to know
What do you mean
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean
What do you mean
Said we're running out of time what do you mean
What do you mean
Better make up your mind
What do you mean
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean
What do you mean
Said we're running out of time what do you mean
What do you mean
Better make up your mind
What do you mean
