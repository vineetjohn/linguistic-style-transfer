[Intro:]
Ayy, yeah baby,
Zoom zoom, squah,
Zoom zoom, ayy ayy

[Hook:]
Baby, won't you come my way?
Got something I want to say
Cannot keep you out my brain
But first off I'm a start by saying this, ayy
All headshots if you think you could take my bitch, ayy
And I'm too turnt, when I shoot, swear I won't miss, ayy
Ba-Baby, won't you come my way?
Baby, won't you come my way?

Ba-Ba-Baby
This is something you should know, I don't ever chase no hoes
I spotted you, you had that glow, watch me pull out all this dough
Take you where you want to go, flexing on your ex, I know
He ain't ever take you out, barely even left your house
How dare that nigga run his mouth when his pockets in a drought
The last single he put out didn't even make it out
And he dumb as hell and I swear his ass don't think, ayy
If he disrespect, two shots and I won't blink, ayy
Never really cared what the fuck these niggas think, ayy
I got deep pockets and I swear my shit's so sick, ayy
And he mad as fuck, big ZooWap all she sing, ayy
And he mad as fuck, big ZooWap in her dreams, ayy
Well he mad as fuck when they say she scream for me, ayy
Big ZooWap what these niggas should be, ayy

[Monty:]
Baby girl, you can stay the night 'till the morn'
All this ice on my arm
What you like, what you want?
And I might put you on
Bitch, it's mine can't you see?
And I rock seventeen
All these knots in my jeans
Me and Zoo turnin' up
Got your boo in the cut
And she sue cause it's looking like the roof going up
Counting all this bread, I don't talk to feds
Try and take my bitch, you gonna take two to the head
Cause baby you the baddest (Baby you the baddest)
All this money, I'm a cash it (All this money, I'm a cash it)
And I'm swervin' all in traffic (And I'm swervin' all in traffic)
While I'm trapping out the mansion (While I'm trapping out the mansion)
And I'm moving through the tri-state (And I'm moving through the tri-state)
Do two-hundred on the highway (Do two-hundred on the highway)
And I'm swerving in my i8 (And I'm swerving in my i8)
Baby, you should come my way (Baby, you should come my way)
Squah!
