So you say you wanna get away
We don't need a plane I could be your escape
Take you to a place

Where there's no time no space

I could be your private island
On a different planet
Anything could happen
Listen to the waves
Let them wash away your pain

I could be your fantasy
I could be your fantasy

Underneath the palm trees
You can leave your worries
Listen to the waves

Say you wanna get so high
Breathe me in like air tonight
Listen to the waves

Listen to the waves

So you say you wanna get so high
Breathe me in like air tonight

Let yourself unwind get lost in the
Garden of my mind
I could be your private island
Underneath the palm trees
You could leave your worries
Listen to the waves
Let them wash away your pain

I could be your fantasy
I could be your fantasy
Underneath the palm trees
You can leave your worries
Listen to the waves
Say you wanna get so high
Breathe me in like air tonight
Listen to the waves
Listen to the waves
