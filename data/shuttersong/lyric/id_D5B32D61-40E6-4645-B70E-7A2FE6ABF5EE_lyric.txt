Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah yeah
Take off those heels, lay on my bed
Whisper dirty secrets while I'm pulling on your hair
Poison in our veins, but we don't even care
Candles dripping on your body, baby this ain't truth or dare
Everybody wonders where we run off to
My body on your body, baby sticking like some glue
Naughty, let's get naughty, girl it's only one or two
The fevers fucking running, feel the heat between us two!

I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride, I'm, I'm gon' ride on you baby
On you lady, all night, all night!
I'm gonna take care of your body
I'll be gentle, don't you scream
It's getting hotter, make it softer
Feel your chest on top of me.
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride, I'm, I'm gon' ride on you baby
On you lady, all night, all night!
I'm gon' make you feel that loving
Getting weak all in your knees.
Kiss your body from the tip-top

All the way down to your feet!

Oh, oh, oh, and we can go slow, slow
Yeah we can go slow, oh, oh, oh
Lay on your back, you like it right there
Don't have to say it twice
Love, There's nothing here to fear

Taking it back, back to where it's clear
Rolling on and on, sounds of love are in the air!

I'm gon' ride, I'm gon ride
I'm gon' ride, I'm, I'm gon' ride on you baby
On you lady, all night, all night!
I'm gonna take care of your body
I'll be gentle, don't you scream
It's getting hotter, make it softer
Feel your chest on top of me.
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride, I'm, I'm gon' ride on you baby
On you lady, all night, all night!
I'm gon' make you feel that loving

Getting weak all in your knees.
Kiss your body from the tip-top

All the way down to your feet!

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
The sun's coming up, oh
You're on my side, oh
I rub your thighs, oh
You look in my eyes, oh
And I just see the skies (see the skies)
I'm so high but I ain't smoked yet
I'm just coming down from this!
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride, I'm, I'm gon' ride on you baby
On you lady, all night, all night!
I'm gonna take care of your body
I'll be gentle, don't you scream
It's getting hotter, make it softer
Feel your chest on top of me.
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride, I'm, I'm gon' ride on you baby
On you lady, all night, all night!
I'm gon' make you feel that loving
Getting weak all in your knees.
Kiss your body from the tip-top
All the way down to your feet
