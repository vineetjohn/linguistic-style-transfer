Mac Miller:
Say, I¡¯m thinking ¡¯bout her every second, every hour
Do my singing in the shower
Picking petals off the flowers like
Do she love me, do she love me not?
I ain¡¯t a player, I just crush a lot
Ariana Grande:
You give me that kinda something
Wanted all the time, needed everyday
On a scale of one to ten I¡¯m at 100
Never get it off, I can¡¯t stay away
Pre-chorus:
If you want, I got it, I got it everyday
You can go on playing it for me
Stay by your side, I¡¯ll never leave you
And I ain¡¯t going nowhere cause you¡¯re a keeper
Chorus:
So don¡¯t you worry, baby you got me
I got a bad boy, must admit it
You got my heart, don¡¯t know how you did it
And I don¡¯t care this is it babe
I don¡¯t want another way to feel you next to me
I love the way you make me feel
I love the way
(I love the way)
Baby I love the way you make me feel
I love the way, the way you love
