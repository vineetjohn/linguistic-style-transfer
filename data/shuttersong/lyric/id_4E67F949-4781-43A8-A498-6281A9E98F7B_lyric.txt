Gold dive diving, diving oh
Gold dive diving, yeah eh eah
Gold dive diving, dive oh
Gold dive diving

Stop the clocks can we just slow it down
He reads your thoughts they go to a higher ground
Invite the guy you like inside the door
Gold, Gold, Gold, Gold, Gold

Let your self be one with the ocean floor
I know gold is not enough, She's a diamond I'm the rock
While I'm laying down I try my luck
Though I know gold is not enough

To catch her I'd have someone like yourself (someone like yourself)
Through crystal balls I don't see no-one else (yeahh)
No I don't feel
No no no no no Heartbeat no x8

Cause gold is not enough
She's a diamond I'm the rock
While laying down I try my luck
Though I know gold is not enough

Oh gold is not enough
She's a diamond I'm the rock
While laying down I try my luck
Don't I know gold is not enough?
Gold diving
Gold diving
Gold diving
Gold x4
