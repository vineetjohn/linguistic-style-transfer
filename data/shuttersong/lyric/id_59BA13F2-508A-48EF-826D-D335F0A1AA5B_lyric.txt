American Psycho

Woah woah woah

I'm an American

I'm an American

I'm, I'm, I'm an American psycho


I think I fell in love again

Maybe I just took too much cough medicine

I'm the best worst thing

That hasn't happened to you yet

The best worst thing

You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out

You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out

And you can kill me, kill me or let God sort 'em out

And you can kill me, kill me or

American Psycho

Woah woah woah

I'm an American

I'm an American

I'm, I'm, I'm an American psycho


I wish I dreamt in the shape of your mouth

But it's your thread count I really care about

Stay up 'til the lights go out

Stay up, stay up

You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out

You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out

And as we're drifting off to sleep

All those dirty thoughts of me

They were never yours to keep


Altered boys, altered boys

We're the things that love destroyed

(I'm an American, I'm an American)

You, me, us, them

We're just resurrection men

(I'm an American, I'm an American)

Us, we were only there, to make you live again

(I'm an American, I'm an American)

Us, we were pity sex, nothing more and nothing less

(I'm an American)
