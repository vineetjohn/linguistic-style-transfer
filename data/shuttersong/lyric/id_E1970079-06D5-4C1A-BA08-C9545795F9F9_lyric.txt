Yeah, you're such a gentleman
You always open doors for me
But you see us kind of different
It's like, you always have to be
The first one to open his mouth
The last one to throw in the towel
It's time to show your self-out
Boy you're trying

Just a little bit too hard
I thought I told you when we met
That all I get from who you are
But I think you like an argument
I don't need to speak up my mind
I'm too grown, I'm taking my time
I'm sick of hearing you rhyme
You're some baby

You don't have to come first
Second is okay 'cause you ain't ever beating me

I say it once
You say it twice
You know I like a little competition from time to time
You think I'm wrong
But I know I'm right
You lose this ain't no kind of competition
I like a man with ambition
For when you gonna know it's time to let go
'Cause I think I'm about to lose my mind

Tell me does this scare you?
That I'm living my dream
No I don't mean to hurt you
But you make me wanna scream
You smile while grinding your cheeks
You clap while stomping your feet
You act like I'm 17
I'm so tired

You don't have to come first
Second is okay 'cause you ain't ever beating me

I say it once
You say it twice
You know I like a little competition from time to time
You think I'm wrong
But I know I'm right
You lose this ain't no kind of competition
I like a man with ambition
For when you gonna know it's time to let go
'Cause I think I'm about to lose my mind

I can do it better
You know I can do it better

What are you trying to prove?
What is it with you?
Always thinking
I can do it better
You know I can do it better
Baby, I can't stand
All these arguments
Why you wanna fight?
Why you always fight?
You ain't always right
I can do it better every day and every night
I can do it better every day and every night

I say it once
You say it twice
You know I like a little competition from time to time
You think I'm wrong
But I know I'm right
You lose this ain't no kind of competition
I like a man with ambition
For when you gonna know it's time to let go
'Cause I think I'm about to lose my mind
