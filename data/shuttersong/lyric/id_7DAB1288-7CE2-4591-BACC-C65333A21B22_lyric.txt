Daisy is darling, Iris is sweet
Lily is lovely, Blossom's a treat
Of all the sweethearts - a guy could meet
Well I finally chose an American beauty rose

Camelia's tragic, she can't be mine
Magnolia's magic, it makes Maggie shine
Laurel will hug you, Orchid's divine
Still I finally chose an American beauty rose

She's clingier than Ivy, and she's zingier than black-eyed Susan
And springier than Mabel in June
I'm daffy as a daffodil, it's laughable the way I thrill
When roses are in bloom

Pansy is pretty, Willow is tall
Violet's kisses, tulips (two lips) recall (Violet's kiss is Tulip's recall)
How can I choose one, I love 'em all
Still I finally chose an American beauty rose
