We fall for each other at the wrong time
Only for a moment but I don't mind
Guess I don't know where to draw the line, the line, the line
We're playing the same game every night

Up in the clouds
Yeah you know how to make me want you
When we come down, oh I know
Yeah I know, it's over

You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
You're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

Why is it so different when we wake up?
Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch
Don't you know that you're doing just enough, but not enough
But I know what's next and I want it so much

Up in the clouds
Yeah you know how to make me want you
When we come down, oh I know, yeah I know, it's over

You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
You're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good good
I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good good

You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
You're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

You've got a hold on me
You're like a wasted dream
I gave you everything
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober
