Load up on guns and Bring your friends

It's fun to lose And to pretend

She's over bored And self assured

Oh no, I know A dirty word

hello, hello, hello, how low?

hello, hello, hello, how low?

hello, hello, hello, how low?

hello, hello, hello.

With the lights out it's less dangerous

Here we are now Entertain us

I feel stupid and contagious

Here we are now Entertain us

A mulatto An albino A mosquito My Libido

Yay, yay, yay

I'm worse at what I do best

And for this gift I feel blessed

Our little group has always been

And always will until the end

hello, hello, hello, how low?

hello, hello, hello, how low?

hello, hello, hello, how low?

hello, hello, hello.

With the lights out it's less dangerous

Here we are now Entertain us

I feel stupid and contagious

Here we are now Entertain us

A mulatto An albino A mosquito My Libido

Yay, yay, yay

And I forget Just why I taste

Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile

I found it hard It was hard to find

Oh well, whatever, nevermind

hello, hello, hello, how low?

hello, hello, hello, how low?

hello, hello, hello, how low?

hello, hello, hello.

With the lights out it's less dangerous

Here we are now Entertain us
