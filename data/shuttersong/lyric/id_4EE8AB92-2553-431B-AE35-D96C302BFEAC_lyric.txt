All the leaves are brown
And the sky is grey
And the sky is grey
I've been for a walk
I've been for a walk
On a winter's day
On a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm
If I was in L.A.
If I was in L.A.
California dreaming
On such a winter's day
Stopped into a church
I passed along the way
Well, I got down on my knees
Got down on my knees
And I pretend to pray
I pretend to pray
You know the preacher likes the cold
Preacher likes the cold
He knows I'm gonna stay
Knows I'm gonna stay
California dreaming
California dreaming
On such a winter's day
All the leaves are brown
All the leaves are brown
And the sky is grey
And the sky is grey
I've been for a walk
I've been for a walk
On a winter's day
On a winter's day
If I didn't tell her
If I didn't tell her
I could leave today
I could leave today
California dreaming
California dreaming
On such a winter's day
California dreaming
On such a winter's day
California dreaming
On such a winter's day
On such a winter's day
