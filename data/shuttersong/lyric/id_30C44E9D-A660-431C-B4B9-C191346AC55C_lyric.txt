Everything is good and brown
I'm here again with a sunshine smile upon my face
My friends are close at hand
And all my inhibitions have disappeared without a trace
I'm glad, oh that I found somebody who I can rely on

This is the return of the space cowboy, interplanetary good vibe zone
Say at the speed of cheeba, you and I go deeper
Maybe I'm gonna have to get high just to get by
You know I got that, I got that cheeba cheeba kinda space cowboy vibe

Everything is good oh and green
Say I'm red again and I don't suppose I'm coming down
I can see clearly, so high in sky
A man with psychedelic picture frames of happiness to shade his eyes
He's glad, oh that he found, somebody who he can rely on

This is the return of the space cowboy
Inter-planetary good vibe zone
Say at the speed of cheeba, you and I go deeper
You and I, you and I, you and I, hey
