I'm hurting, baby, I'm broken down
I need your loving, loving
I need it now
When I'm without you
I'm something weak
You got me begging, begging
I'm on my knees

[Pre-Chorus:]
I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killing me when you're away, ooh, baby,
'Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

[Chorus:]
Your sugar
Yes, please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah, you show me good loving
Make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar
Yes, please
Won't you come and put it down on me?

My broken pieces
You pick them up
Don't leave me hanging, hanging
Come give me some
When I'm without ya
I'm so insecure
You are the one thing, one thing
I'm living for

[Pre-Chorus:]
I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killing me when you're away, ooh, baby,
'Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

[Chorus:]
Your sugar
Yes, please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here,
'Cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah, you show me good loving
Make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar! (sugar!)
Yes, please (yes, please)
Won't you come and put it down on me?

Yeah
I want that red velvet
I want that sugar sweet
Don't let nobody touch it
Unless that somebody's me
I gotta be your man
There ain't no other way
'Cause girl you're hotter than a southern California day

I don't wanna play no games
You don't gotta be afraid
Don't give me all that shy shit
No make-up on
That's my

[Chorus:]
Sugar
Yes, please (please)
Won't you come and put it down on me (down on me)?
I'm right here (right here), 'cause I need ('cause I need)
Little love, a little sympathy
So, baby, (yeah) you show me good loving
Make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar! (sugar!)
Yes, please (yes, please)
Won't you come and put it down on me?

[Chorus:]
Sugar
Yes, please
Won't you come and put it down on me?

Little love, a little sympathy

Your sugar! (sugar!)

Won't you come and put it down on me? (down on me, down on me)
