Wrapped around my soul
 
Hard forgiving, hard forget
 
Faith is in our hands
 
Castles made of sand
 
No more guessing, no regrets
 
And you came my way on a winner's day
Shouted loudly come out and play
Can't you tell I got news for you
Sun is shining and so are you
 
And we're gonna be alright
Dry your tears and hold tight
 
Can't you tell I got news for you
 
Sun is shining and so are you
 
And we're gonna be alright
Dry your tears and hold tight
Can't you tell I got news for you
Sun is shining and so are you
 
Diamonds to behold, waiting to unfold
 
Bite the bullet, bite your tongue
 
Love beyond believe
 
Wait the seven sense
 
Come uneven, come undone
 
And you came my way on a winner's day
Shouted loudly come out and play
Can't you tell I got news for you
Sun is shining and so are you
 
And we're gonna be alright
 
Dry your tears and hold tight
 
Can't you tell I got news for you
 
Sun is shining and so are you
 
Sun is shining and so are you
 
Sun is shining and so are you
Sun is shining and so are you
Sun is shining and so are you
 
Sun is shining and so are you
 
Sun is shining and so are you
 
Can't you tell I got news for you
 
Sun is shining and so are you
 
And we're gonna be alright
 
Dry your tears and hold tight
Can't you tell I got news for you
Sun is shining and so are you
Na is shining and so are you
 
Sun is shining and so are you
 
Sun is shining and so are you
 
Sun is shining and so are you
 
Sun is shining and so are you
Sun is shining and so are you
 
Sun is shining and so are you
 
Sun is shining and so are you
