A shot in the dark
A past, lost in space
And where do I start
The past, and the chase
You want to be gone
Like a wolf, a predator
I feel like a deer in the light

You loved me and I froze in time
Hungry for that flesh of mine
But I can't compete with the she wolf
Who has brought me to my knees
What do you see in those yellow eyes

Cause I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces

Falling to pieces
Did she lie and wait
Was obey to pull you in
The thrill of the kill
You feel, there's a sin
I lay with the wolfs
And now it seems, I thought I was part of you

You loved me and I froze in time
Hungry for that flesh of mine
But I can't compete with the she wolf
Who has brought me to my knees

What do you see in those yellow eyes
Cause I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
Falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
Falling to pieces
