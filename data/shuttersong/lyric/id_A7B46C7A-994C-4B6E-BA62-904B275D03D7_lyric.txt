Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you

Acting on your best behavior
turn your back on Mother Nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

It's my own desire
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide

Help me make the
most of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever

Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while

the walls come tumbling down
When they do, I'll be right behind you
So glad we've almost made it
So sad we had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world
Everybody wants to rule the world
Everybody wants to rule the world
