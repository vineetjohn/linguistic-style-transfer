I do my best
To find some kind of glow
I'm givin' it some heart and soul, now
From the darkest grays
The sun bursts, clouds break
Yeah, we see that fire
From the streets of Babylon
To the road that we've been on now
The kaleidoscope claims another

Whoa oh oh oh
Well this is life in color (color)
Today feels like no other (other)
And the darkest grays
The sun bursts, clouds break

Whoa oh oh oh
Well this is life in motion (motion)
And just when I could run this race no more
The sun bursts, clouds break
This is life in color

You've seen my worst
Yet you see some hope in me
The black and white sets us free
Like the queen to the rook
Your decision was a sure thing
Honey yeah, a sure thing
No wonder I feel
Like I'm missing a heavy load
But no matter what daylight brings to us
We all know

Whoa oh oh oh
Well this is life in color (color)
Today feels like no other (other)
And the darkest grays
The sun bursts, clouds break

Whoa oh oh oh
Well this is life in motion (motion)
And just when I couldn't run this race anymore
The sun bursts, clouds break
This is life in color
This is life in color

Ooooh ooh

Well this is life in color
Today feels like no other
And the darkest grays
The sun bursts, clouds break
Whoa oh oh oh
Well this is life in motion (motion)
Just when I couldn't run this race anymore
The sun bursts, clouds break
This is life in color
This is life in color, yeah
