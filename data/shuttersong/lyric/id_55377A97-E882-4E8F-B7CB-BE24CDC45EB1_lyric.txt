Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud, heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat (beat)
Forevermore
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me (me)

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat (beat)
Forevermore
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me (me)

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York

Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me

Welcome to New York (new soundtrack)
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York (the lights are so bright but they never blind me)
Welcome to New York (so bright, they never blind me)

Welcome to New York.
