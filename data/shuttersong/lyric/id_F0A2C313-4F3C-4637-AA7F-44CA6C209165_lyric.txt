Coming Over - Dillon Francis
Is it alright if I come round
Is it too late if I come now
Would you stay up to figure this out
Some way
If I stay here would you come back
If I stay cool would you be mad
Would you want me if I want you
That way
Cause all I can think about is coming over coming over
All I can think about is coming over coming over
All I can think about is coming over coming over coming over
Isn't it strange
Isn't it strange
Isn't it strange
Isn't it strange
Isn't it strange that every time
I look at your name I'm suddenly high
For you to feel the same I would do almost anything
I'd give away this give away that
All of my shoes and all of my hats
All I need's you and a bit of music
Cause all I can think about is coming over coming over
All I can think about is coming over coming over
All I can think about is coming over coming over coming over
Isn't it strange
Isn't it strange
Isn't it strange
Isn't it strange
Cause all I can think about is coming over coming over
All I can think about is coming over coming over
All I can think about is coming over coming over coming over
