I can't run anymore
I fall before you
Here I am
I have nothing left
Though I've tried to forget
You're all that I am
Take me home
I'm through fighting it

Broken
Lifeless
I give up
You're my only strength
Without you
I can't go on
Anymore

Ever again

My only hope
(All the times I've tried)
My only peace
(To walk away from you)
My only joy
My only strength
(I fall into your abounding grace)
My only power

My only life
(And love is where I am)

My only love

I can't run anymore
I give myself to you
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
In all my bitterness
I ignored all that's real and true
All I need is you
When night falls on me
I'll not close my eyes
I'm too alive
And you're too strong

I can't lie anymore
I fall down before you
I'm sorry

I'm sorry

My only hope
(All the times I've tried)
My only peace
(To walk away from you)
My only joy

My only strength
(I fall into your abounding grace)
My only power
My only life

(And love is where I am)
My only love

Constantly ignoring

The pain consuming me
But this time it's cut too deep
I'll never stray again

My only hope
(All the times I've tried)
My only peace
(To walk away from you)
My only joy
My only strength
(I fall into your abounding grace)
My only power
My only life
(And love is where I am)
My only love
My only hope
(All the times I've tried)
My only peace
(To walk away from you)
My only joy
My only strength
(I fall into your abounding grace)
My only power
My only life
(And love is where I am)
My only love
