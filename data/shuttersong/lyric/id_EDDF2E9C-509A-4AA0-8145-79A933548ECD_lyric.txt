I love the way she fills her clothes
She looks just like them girls in vogue
I love the way she plays it cool
I think that she is beautiful

She's so lovely
She's so lovely
She's so lovely
She's so lovely

She's so lovely
She's so lovely
She's so lovely
She's pretty

A fittie
She's got a boyfriend though and that's a pity
She's flirty turned thirty
Ain't that the age a girl gets really dirty
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
How we'll make it through this
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

I love the way she bites her lip
I love the way she shakes her hips
I love the way she makes me drool
i think that she is beautiful

She's so lovely
She's so lovely
She's so lovely
She's so lovely

She's so lovely
She's so lovely
She's so lovely
A stunner

I wonder
Was she this fit when she was ten years younger
Come see me discreetly
She says she's got a trick or two to teach me
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
How we'll make it through this

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
How we'll make it through this

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
How we'll make it through this
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
How we'll make it through this

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I think that you are lovely
I think that you are lovely
I think that you are lovely
I think that you are lovely
I think that you are lovely
I think that you are lovely
I think that you are lovely
I think that you are beautiful
She's so lovely
She's so lovely
She's so lovely
She's so lovely
She's so lovely
She's so lovely
She's so lovely
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
How we'll make it through this
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
How we'll make it through this
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
How we'll make it through this
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know...
