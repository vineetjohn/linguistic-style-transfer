If you had a day would you give me a moment?
Would you allow our play to leave no bone unbroken?

Let's love like seventeen
I'm in love with poisoning
Only bring your pretty frightful gifts to me
Lets love and kill like seventeen now

If I weren't so cold
We couldn't freeze this moment.
And as we won't grow old
We'll leave no heart unbroken

Let's love like seventeen
I'm in love with poisoning
Only bring your pretty frightful gifts to me
Lets love and kill like seventeen now

Tomorrow cannot be like this
And even know it's such a similar...
Tomorrow cannot be like this
Tomorrow they will take us in

We'll leave no heart unbroken
Let's love like seventeen
I'm in love with poisoning

Only bring your pretty frightful gifts to me
Lets love and kill like seventeen now
Let's love like seventeen
I'm in love with your new screams
Only bring those pretty frightful things to me
Let's love and kill like seventeen now
Let's run and kill like seventeen now
Lets love and kill like seventeen
