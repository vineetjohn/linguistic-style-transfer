I'm in here
can anybody see me?

Can anybody help?
I'm in here, a prisoner of history

Can anybody help?
Can't you hear my call?
Are you coming to get me now?
I've been waiting for
You to come rescue me
I need you to hold
All of the sadness I can not
Living inside of me.

I'm in here, I'm trying to tell you something
Can anybody help?

I'm in here, I'm calling out but you can't hear
Can anybody help?

Can't you hear my call?
Are you coming to get me now?
I've been waiting for
You to come rescue me
I need you to hold
All of the sadness I can not
Living inside of me.

I'm crying out, I'm breaking down
I am fearing it all
Stuck inside these walls
Tell me there is hope for me
Is anybody out there listening?

Can't you hear my call?
Are you coming to get me now?
I've been waiting for
You to come rescue me,
I need you to hold
All of the sadness I can not
Living inside of me.
Can't you hear my call?
Are you coming to get me now?
I've been waiting for
You to come rescue me,
I need you to hold
Living inside of me.
I'm in here, can anybody see me?
Can anybody help?
