Oooooh ohhhhh
Oooooh ohhhhh

I hung up the phone tonight
Something happened for the first time
Deep inside
It was a rush, what a rush (What a rush)
'Cause the possibility

That you would ever feel the same way about me
It's just too much, just too much (Just too much)
Why do I keep running from the truth?
All I ever think about is you

You've got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
And I just got to know
Do you ever think when you're all alone?
All that we could be, where this thing could go?

Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it real or just another crush?
Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back, like the way you do?
'Cause I'm trying, trying to walk away
But I know this crush ain't goin' away
Goin' away
Has it ever crossed your mind
When we're hangin', spendin' time girl
Are we just friends?
Is there more?

Is there more?
See, it's a chance we've gotta take
'Cause I believe that we can make this into
Something that will last, last forever
Forever (Do you ever think when you're all alone?)

All that we could be, where this thing could go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it real or just another crush?
Do you catch a breath when I look at you?

Are you holding back, like the way you do?
'Cause I'm trying, trying to walk away
But I know this crush ain't goin' away
Goin' away
Why do I keep running from the truth? (Why do I keep running?)
All I ever think about is you (All I ever think about)
You've got my hypnotized (Hypnotized)
So mesmerized (Mesmerized)
And I just got to know
Do you ever think (Ever think) when you're all alone (All alone)
All that we could be, where this thing could go? (Go)

Am I crazy or falling in love? (Crazy)
Is it real or just another crush? (Another crush, yeah, yeah)
Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back, like the way you do?
'Cause I'm trying, trying to walk away (Whoa)
But I know this crush ain't goin' away
(This crush ain't) Goin' away (Goin' away)
Goin' away
Goin' away
