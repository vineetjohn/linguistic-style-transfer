FML - Kanye West

I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
I'm the only one that's in control
I been feeling all I've given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God I'm willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul my soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
See before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his lexapro
Remember that last time in mexico
Remember that last time the episode
Asking me why the hell I text in code
Four times that you say don't text me hoe
Told you four times don't test me hoe
Now we finna lose all self control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the giuseppe store
But I'mma have the last laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
Yeah I'mma have the laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
And I
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
See through the veil
And forget all of your cares
Throw them throw them away
Don't stop your loving
Don't stop for nothing
No not for nothing
They don't wanna see me love you
Nah don't stop it
They always love it
They always wanna
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
