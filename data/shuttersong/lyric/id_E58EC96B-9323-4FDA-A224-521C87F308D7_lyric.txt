Waves - Mr. Probz
Written by£ºDennis Princewell Stehr/Jihad Rahmouni
My face above the water
My feet can't touch the ground
Touch the ground and it feels like
I can see the sands on the horizon
Everytime you are not around
I'm slowly drifting away drifting away
Wave after wave wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting drifting away
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the stream
I wish I could make it easy
Easy to love me love me
But still I reach to find a way
I'm stuck here in between
I'm looking for the right words to say
I'm slowly drifting drifting away
Wave after wave wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting drifting away
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the stream
