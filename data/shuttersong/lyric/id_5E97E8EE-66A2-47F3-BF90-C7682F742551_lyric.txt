Sat back with the window down
Eighty an hour and the radio loud
The same songs with the same old rhymes
Tell me to shake it off and swing from the lights

But I can't help it drive away from all the mess you made
You sent this hurricane, now it won't go away
And I promised I'd be there, but you don't make it easy
Darling, please believe me

Cause loving you, loving you is too hard
All I do, all I do is not enough
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you

Loving you, loviitng you leaves me hurt
All I do, all I do is get burned
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you

Count stacks of the routine lies
Funny how easy you could see my blindside
Still the same songs with the same old beats
Sure, I could stay, but there's a place I'd rather be

And I can't help it drive away from all the mess you made
You sent this hurricane, now it won't go away
And I promised I'd be there, but you don't make it easy
Darling, please believe me

Cause loving you, loving you is too hard
All I do, all I do is not enough
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you

Loving you, loving you leaves me hurt
All I do, all I do is get burned
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you

See, I remember all the times you made me; covered in crazy
I can't forgot about the way you played me
Like I was never gonna change your world
It ended long ago; so, please just let me go
It ended long ago; so, please just let me go

Loving you, loving you is too hard
All I do, all I do is not enough
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you leaves me hurt
All I do, all I do is get burned
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you
Oh, loving you, loving you
All I do, all I do
Loving you, loving you
Oh, oh, loving you, loving you
