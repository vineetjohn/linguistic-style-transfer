I never take a day off, work around the clock
my engineer gettin' paid off
rock like aseop, light the weed and take off
so high i cannot see adolf
now i got these rappers all breakin up a sweat
cause everytime i get up on the mic I come correct
and i learned it from the best, always dressed in something fresh
lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest
yes, they heard i used to rock guess
but now i'm rocking clothes that ain't in the stores yet
travel back in time, i'm in a vortex
trying to make it work out think i need more reps
used to take the bus now the boy board jets
cause kids got me buzzing like a fucking hornet
they say i got next, tell em that i got now
it's all disney, boy my family proud
make 'em say ow, make 'em say oh
the hoes that tell me yes, the same ones that tell ya no
whoa, i ain't just an average joe
way above the average flow, boy my life is most dope

No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
pursuit to be happy only laughing like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesing from cheek to cheek
and I ain't gonna wait for nothing cause that just ain't my style
life couldn't get better, this gon' be the best day ever

If it ain't about the dream, than it ain't about me
gon' a couple four weeks without a good night's sleep
imagination, making, musical creation
the journey that i'm facing plus the paper that i'm chasing
got me crazy after sane with the lames i see you hating
but there's nothing that can change it, thumbs up i'm maintaining
no complaining when it's raining, i'll be in another zone
move out my mothers home to a world i call my own
I ain't gonna play around no more
find the difference from the ground and the floor
if we gotta fight, i'll be down for the war
thumbs up, homie i'll be sure

No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
pursuit to be happy only laughing like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
it got me cheesing from cheek to cheek
and I ain't gonna wait for nothing cause that just ain't my style
life couldn't get better, this gon' be the best day ever
