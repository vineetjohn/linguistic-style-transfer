Can your heart be mine in search
Cause I have no time to help you find
All the words
Melodies and memories
Stories that sound absurd
I will tell no lies

As long as you look me in the eyes
I'll go wherever you are
I'll follow behind

Heard about all the things you done
And all the walls you've been in
Heard about all the love you lost
It was over before it began
Heard about all the miles you've gone
Just to gone to start again
Heard about all the things you've been through
It sounds like you need a friend, a friend

Please don't wait
I'm not coming home tonight
I wanna love you but I can't

As long as you look me in the eyes
I'll go wherever you are
I'll follow behind

Heard about all the things you done
And all the walls you've been in
Heard about all the love you lost
It was over before it began
Heard about all the miles you've gone
Just to gone to start again
Heard about all the things you've been through
It sounds like you need a friend, a friend

I never doubted myself
But I doubted you
I'm tired of looking by myself
And not with you
