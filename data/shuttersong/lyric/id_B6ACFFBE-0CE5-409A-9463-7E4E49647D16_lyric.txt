Lately I've been thinkin', thinkin' ‘bout what we had
I know it was hard, it was all that we knew, yeah.
Have you been drinkin', to take all the pain away?
I wish that I could give you what you, deserve

‘Cause nothing could ever, ever replace you
Nothing can make me feel like you do.
You know there's no one, I can relate to
And know we won't find a love that's so true.

There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm.
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together.

I gave you everything, baby, everything I had to give
Girl, why would you push me away?
Lost in confusion, like an illusion
You know I'm used to making your day.

But that is the past now, we didn't last now
Guess that this is meant to be.
Tell me was it worth it? We were so perfect
But baby I just want you to see

There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm.
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together.
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm.
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together.
