Fallingforyou - The 1975
What time you coming down 
We started losing light 
I'll never make it right
If you don't want me around 
I'm so excited for the night 
All we need's my bike and your enormous house
You said some day we might
When I'm closer to your height
'Til then we'll knock around  endlessly
You're all I need
Don't you see me now 
I think I'm falling  I'm falling for you 
Don't you need me 
I  I think I'm falling  I'm falling for you 
And on this night and in this light 
I think I'm falling  I'm falling for you
Maybe you'll change your mind
I think I'm falling  I think I'm falling
I'm caught on your coat again
You said  "Oh  no  it's fine "
I read between the lines
And touched your leg again  again
I'll take you one day at a time 
Soon you will be mine 
Oh but I want you now (I want you now)
When the smoke is in your eyes 
You look so alive 
Do you fancy sitting down with me  Maybe 
You're all I need
According to your heart 
My place is not deliberate 
Feeling of your arms
I don't wanna be your friend 
I wanna kiss your neck
Don't you see me 
I  I think I'm falling  I'm falling for you
Don't you need me 
I  I think I'm falling  I'm falling for you
And on this night and in this light
I think I'm falling  I'm falling for you
Maybe you'll change your mind
