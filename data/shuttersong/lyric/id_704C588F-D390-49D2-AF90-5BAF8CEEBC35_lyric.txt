Wait for your caller
The call never came
Ready to fall in
Ready to claim

I'm ready for it all, love...
I'm ready for the change
Meet under sunlight
Meet me again
In the rain
In the rain

Behind the walls, love
I'm trying to change
I'm ready for it all, love...
I'm ready for the pain
So meet under blue sky
Meet me again
In the rain
In the rain
In the rain
The rain...

Got to find yourself alone in the swirl,
You've got to find yourself alone...
Ooh...
