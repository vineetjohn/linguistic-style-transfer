Don't think sorry's easily said
Don't try, turnin' tables instead
You've taken lots of chances before
But I ain't gonna give anymore

Don't ask me
That's how it goes
'Cause part of me knows what you're thinkin'

Don't say words you're gonna regret
Don't let the fire rush to your head
I've heard the accusation before
And I ain't gonna take any more

Believe me
The sun in your eyes
Made some of the lies worth believing

I am the eye in the sky, looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules, dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind

And I don't need to see any more
To know that

I can read your mind
(Looking at you)
I can read your mind
(Looking at you)
I can read your mind
(Looking at you)
I can read your mind

Don't leave false illusion behind
Don't cry, I ain't changing my mind
So find another fool like before
'Cause I ain't gonna live anymore

Believing
Some of the lies
While all of the signs are deceiving

I am the eye in the sky, looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules, dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind

And I don't need to see any more
To know that

I can read your mind
(Looking at you)
I can read your mind
(Looking at you)

I can read your mind
(Looking at you)
I can read your mind
I am the eye in the sky, looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules, dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
And I don't need to see any more
To know that
I can read your mind
(Looking at you)
I can read your mind
(Looking at you)
I can read your mind
(Looking at you)
I can read your mind
