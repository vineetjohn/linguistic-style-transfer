The sun is setting, in your eye
Here by my side, and the movie is playing,
but we won't be watching tonight
Every look, every touch, makes me wanna give you my heart
I be crushin' on you baby
Stay the way you are cause…

I never knew, I never knew, you could haaave mo-onlight in your hands.
Til the night I have you, you (ohh)
In the mooonlight
Mooooonlight

I kissed his fingertips, as a wish and he's all mine
He's giving me Elvis with some James Dean in his eyes
put his lips, on my neck, makes me wanna give him my body
I be fallin' fallin' baby
And I just can't stop cause

I never knew, I never knew, you could haaave moonlight in your hands.
Til the night I have you, you (ohh)
In the mooonlight
Moooooonlight

Baby I be fallin', in the moooonlight
Moooooonlight.

He's so bossy, he makes me dance
Tryna sit in the back of his whip
And just cancel my plans
Sweet like candy
But he's such a man
He knows just what it does
When he's holding me tight
And he calls me ‘Moonlight' too
