It's a long way home
When you're on your own
And your only friends
Are traffic lights
Speaking in morse code...
Yeah, the road is long
And I am tired...
But with you on my horizon
I will drive until it all breaks down...
'Cause I can't breathe
Without you near...
You keep me safe
Keep me sane
Keep me honest.
You keep me alive
On the edge of tonight!
Chasing tomorrow
With fire in my eyes, yeah!
You're like a siren in the dark
You're the beat playing in my heart.
You keep me alive
On the edge of tonight, yeah...
Spent my whole damn life
Tryn'na get things right...
And for every one
Of my mistakes
You gave me all these chances.
When the road's too long
And I am tired...
With you on my horizon
And I'll drive until it all breaks down
You keep me alive
On the edge of tonight!
Chasing tomorrow
With fire in my eyes, yeah!
You're like a siren in the dark
You're the beat playing in my heart.
You keep me alive
On the edge of tonight.
Oh, woah...
Oh, woah-oh...
You keep me safe
You keep me sane
You keep me honest
(Honest, honest...)
Oh, woah...
Oh, woah-oh...
You keep me safe
You keep me sane
You keep me honest
(Honest, honest...)
You keep me alive
(You keep me alive!)
On the edge of tonight
(On the edge of tonight!)
We're chasing tomorrow
(Chasing tomorrow!)
With fire in our eyes, yeah!
You're like a siren in the dark
(Siren in the dark!)
You're the beat playing in my heart.
(The beat playing in my heart!)
You keep me alive
On the edge of tonight, yeah...
We're on the edge of tonight!
(Oh, woah...)
The edge of tonight...
(Oh, woah...)
You keep me safe
You keep me sane
You keep me honest!
(Honest, honest...)
Standing on the edge of tonight!
(Oh, woah...)
On the edge of tonight...
(Oh, woah...)
The edge of tonight...
(Oh, woah...)
The edge of tonight...
(Oh, woah...)
