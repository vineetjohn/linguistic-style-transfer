Oh, hey...
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
To you
Mmm... mmm... mmm...

Oh, yeah, babe
My whole life has changed
Since you came in, I knew back then
You were that special one

I'm so in love, so deep in love
You make my life complete
You are so sweet, no one competes
Glad you came into my life

You blind me with your love, with you I have no sight
Girl, you open me, I'm wide open
And I'm doing things I never do
But I feel so good, I feel so good

Why'd it take so long, finding you
This is my story and I'm telling you
It's not fiction, it's surely a fact
Without you right here having my back

I really don't know just where I'd be at
My whole life has changed (My whole life has changed)
Since you came in, I knew back then (Ooh... oh...)
You were that special one (You were baby)

I'm so in love, so deep in love
You make my life complete (You make, make my life complete)
You are so sweet (Oh, oh), no one competes
Glad you came into my life (Ooh...)

You blind me with your love, with you I have no sight
I analyzed myself, I was buck wild
Never thought about settling down
But all the time I knew I was ready

But not with all my friends around
But girl, I put you first now (I put you first now)
You made me, helped mold me (Helped mold me, baby)
Turned me into a man, I'm so responsible

And I owe it all to you
My whole life has changed (My whole life has changed)
Since you came in, I knew back then (Oh, oh)
You were that special one (You were that special one)
I'm so in love, so deep in love (Oh, oh, oh...)

You are so sweet, no one competes
Glad you came into my life (So glad you came in)
You blind me with your love (Blind me, baby)
with you I have no sight
{God has blessed me} God has blessed me, baby
Girl, He was good to me when He sent you {I'm so happy, baby}

I'm so happy, I'm so happy, baby, oh, yes i am
{Share my world} Come and share my world, baby
oh... whoa... yeah. yeah
