Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

Black dog
Drinks from the water
Trying to cool his tongue
Like the king
Finds no peace
His work is never done
Night falls
Smoke on the water
Darkness closes in
Cold white hand, in the deep
Will drown you for your sins

It's a lifelong expedition
Second-guessing your decisions
Trying to find out what's been missing
Pages keep on filling

Crying out
Ooh go and wake the king
Call to arms
For those who kiss the ring
Stand your ground
The walls are coming down
It's do or die
Do or die

Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

Mad man
Blood on the altar
The Queen will have his head
His ghosts will shake those rattling chains
Long after he's dead
No soul knows his trouble
High upon his throne
Loved by few and judged by many
He bares that weight alone

It's a lifelong expedition
Second-guessing your decisions
Trying to find out what's been missing
And the pages keep on filling

Crying out
Ooh go and wake the king
Call to arms
For those who kiss the ring
Stand your ground
Yeah the walls are coming down
It's do or die
Do or die
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
