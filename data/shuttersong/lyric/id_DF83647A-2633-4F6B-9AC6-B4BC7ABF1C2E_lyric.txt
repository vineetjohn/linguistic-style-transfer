"Alive"

My mother told me I should go and get some therapy
I asked the doctor, "Can you find out what is wrong with me?
I don't know why I wanna be with every girl I meet.
I can't control it.
Yeah, I know it's taking over me.
I'm going crazy.
Can't contain it.
So tell me just what I should do?"

She said, "Hey, it's alright.
Does it make you feel alive?
Don't look back,
Live your life,
Even if it's only for tonight."
She said, "Hey, it's alright
If it makes you feel alive."

Went to a party just after the doctor talked to me
I met a girl, I took her right up to the balcony
I whispered something in her ear that I just can't repeat
She said, "OK," but she was worried what her friends will think
She's going crazy
Can't contain it
She asked me, "What should I do, oh?"

I said, "Hey, it's alright.
Does it make you feel alive?
Don't look back,
Live your life,
Even if it's only for tonight."
I said, "Hey, it's alright
If it makes you feel alive."

We got to live before we get older
Do what we like
We got nothing to lose
Shake off the weight of the world from your shoulders
Oh, we got nothing to prove

I said, "Hey, it's alright.
Does it make you feel alive?
Don't look back,
Live your life,
Even if it's only for tonight."

I said, "Hey, it's alright.
Does it make you feel alive?
Don't look back,
Live your life,
Even if it's only for tonight."
I said, "Hey, it's alright
If it makes you feel alive."
