I heard she broke your heart again
So now you're gonna come and see me
We're back to the start again
When's she gonna set me free?

I've been there time and time again
The girl's no good for me and you
She hurts me too

I heard she broke your heart again
I heard she broke your heart
Well, that girl's a heartbreaker

I heard she broke your heart again
I heard she broke your heart
Well, that girl's a heartbreaker

Well now, that girl may have friends in the business
And great qualities that I have yet to see
But in my eyes, she's done us wrong
Enough times for you to side with me

I heard she broke your heart again
I heard she broke your heart
Well, that girl's a heartbreaker

I heard she broke your heart again
I heard she broke your heart
Well, that girl's a heartbreaker

Heartbreaker, I'll break her
Heartbreaker, I'll break ya
Heartbreaker, I'll break her
Heartbreaker, I'll break ya
Heartbreaker, I'll break her
Heartbreaker, I'll break ya
Heartbreaker, I'll break her
Heartbreaker, I'll break ya
