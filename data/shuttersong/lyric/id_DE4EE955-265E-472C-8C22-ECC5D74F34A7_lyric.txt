Ballerina Girl
You are so lovely
With you standing there
I'm so aware
Of how much I care for you

You are more than now
You are for always
I can see in you
My dreams come true
Don't you ever go away

You make me feel like
There's nothing I can't do
And when I hold you
I only want to say
I love you

Ballerina Girl
The joy you bring me
Every day and night
Holding you tight
How I've waited for your love

Sometimes I've wondered
If you'd ever come my way
Now that I've finally found you
This is where my heart will stay

I'm never gonna break your heart
Never will we drift apart
'Cause all I wanna do
Is share my whole life with you

'Cause you make me feel like
There's nothing I can't do
I guess I finally realized
There's nothing else like loving you
Ballerina Girl
You are so lovely
I can see in you
My dreams come true
Don't you ever go away
Ballerina Girl...
