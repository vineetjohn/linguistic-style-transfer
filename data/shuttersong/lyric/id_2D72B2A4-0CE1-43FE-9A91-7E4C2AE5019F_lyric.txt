When I signed my deal
I felt pressure
Don't want to see the numbers
I want to see heaven
You say could you write a song for me
I said I'm sorry I won't do that happily
When I go home
I tend to close the door
I never wanted more
So sing with me
Can't you see
I don't have
Money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for
I do it for the love
I don't have
Money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for
I do it for the love
I do it for the love
I do it for the love
Please don't get me wrong
I wanna keep it moving
I know what that requires
I'm not foolish
Please can you make this work for me
Cause I'm not a puppet I will work against your strings
When I go home
I tend to close the door
I never wanted more
So sing with me
Can't you see
I don't have
Money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for
I do it for the love
I don't have
Money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for
I do it for the love
I do it for the love
I do it for the love
When the sun will set
Don't you fret
No I have no money on my mind
No money on my mind
No money on my mind
No I have have money on my mind
When the sun will set
Don't you fret
No I have no money on my mind
No money on my mind
No money on my mind
No I have have money on my mind
Just love
