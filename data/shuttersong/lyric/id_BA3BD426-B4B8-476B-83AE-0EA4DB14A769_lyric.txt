I'm more than just an option
Hey, hey, hey
Refused to be forgotten
Hey, hey, hey
I took a chance with my heart
Hey, hey, hey
And I feel it taking over

I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart

I'm more than just a number
Hey, hey, hey
I doubt you'll find another
Hey, hey, hey
So every single summer
Hey, hey, hey
I'll be the one that you remember

And I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart

It's more than just a mission
Hey, hey, hey
You hear but you don't listen
Hey, hey, hey
You better pay attention
Hey, hey, hey
And get what you been missing

I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart

Too many times I've been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do
But give all I have to you and

I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I bet if I give all my love
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart
I bet if I give all my love
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart
