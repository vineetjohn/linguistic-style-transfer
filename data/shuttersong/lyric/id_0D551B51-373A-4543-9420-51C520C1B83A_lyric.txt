Do you remember me?

From before

From before

And birds, oh birds

Can you recall my songs?

Birds, oh birds

Can you recall my songs?

From before

From before

From before

From before

Fire, oh fire

I can still feel your warmth

Fire, oh fire

I can still feel your warmth

Like before

Like before

Like before
