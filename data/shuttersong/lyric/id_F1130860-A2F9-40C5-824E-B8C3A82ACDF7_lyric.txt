All I want to get is, a little bit closer
All I want to know is, can you come a little closer?

Here comes the breath before we get, a little bit closer
Here comes the rush before we touch, come a little closer

The doors are open, the wind is really blowing
The night sky is changing overhead

It's not just all physical
I'm the type who won't get oh so critical
So let's make things physical
I won't treat you like you're oh so typical
I won't treat you like you're oh so typical

All you think of lately is getting underneath me
All I dream of lately is how to get you underneath me

Here comes the heat before we meet, a little bit closer
Here comes the spark before the dark, come a little closer

The lights are off and the sun is finally setting
The night sky is changing overhead

It's not just all physical
I'm the type who won't get oh so critical
So let's make things physical
I won't treat you like you're oh so typical
I want you close, I want you
I won't treat you like you're typical
I want you close, I want you
I won't treat you like you're typical

Here come the dreams of you and me
Here come the dreams
Here come the dreams of you and me
Here come the dreams

It's not just all physical
I'm the type who won't get oh so critical
So let's make things physical
I won't treat you like you're oh so typical
I want you close, I want you
I won't treat you like you're typical
I want you close, I want you
I won't treat you like you're typical
I won't treat you like you're typical
I won't treat you like you're typical

All I want to get is, a little bit closer
All I want to know is, can you come a little closer?
