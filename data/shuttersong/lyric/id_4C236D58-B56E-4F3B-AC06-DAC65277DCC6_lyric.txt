Is the sun in your eyes, easy rider?
Do the flame-colored skies light your fire?
We are heavy metal lions
They will never understand
The kind of people you or I am
Bow your heads and take your hands

They were angels forever
Forever angels
They were angels forever
Forever angels

Does the ocean inspire, easy rider?
Do the stars and the wind take you higher?
You are California proud?
You are angels of the night?
Rock & roll guardians now
The last keepers of the light

They were angels forever
Forever angels
They were angels forever
Forever angels

Paradise is a hell-colored flame sky
Is it nice to feel free and wild?
Paradise is the game of do-or-die
They were angels forever
Forever angels
They were angels forever
Forever angels
