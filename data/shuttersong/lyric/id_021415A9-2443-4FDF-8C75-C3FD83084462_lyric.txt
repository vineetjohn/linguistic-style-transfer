Fighting shadows
In their haunting guise
Smiting the wicked baron
And unleash my might

When we face our final hour
In the darkest rift
Come what ever may
I'll be the death of you
After channeling my power
Your end will be swift
Now there's nothing in my way
You'll feel my deathfire grasp!

Clashing minions
Ravaged fields of war
Manifest my dominion
Total chaos restored

When we face our final hour
In the darkest rift
Come what ever may
I'll be the death of you
After channeling my power
Your end will be swift
Now there's nothing in my way
You'll feel my deathfire grasp!

When we face our final hour
In the darkest rift
Come what ever may
I'll be the death of you
After channeling my power
Your end will be swift
Now there's nothing in my way
You'll feel my deathfire grasp!
