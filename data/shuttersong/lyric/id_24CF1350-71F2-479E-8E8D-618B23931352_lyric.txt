You think I'm pretty
without any make-up on
You think I'm funny when I tell the
punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I'll let the walls come down, down
Before you met me I was alright
But things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February
You'll be my valentine, valentine
Let's go all the way tonight

No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever
You make me
Feel like I'm living a

Teenage Dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort
out of sheets
I finally found you
My missing puzzle piece
I'm complete
Let's go all the way tonight

No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever
You make me

Feel like I'm living a
Teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance
And don't ever look back

Don't ever look back
I might get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
You make me
Feel like I'm living a
Teenage Dream

The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops

When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
I might get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream
Tonight, tonight, tonight
