I half remembered, half way across the world
Twice removed from a second home
The shadow of a ghost in an old haunt
With a lease on my life 'cause I can't afford to own
When being young starts getting old
A new place saves face, or so I'm told
Be the new kid, on an old block
A chalk outline on a playground blacktop

I'm just a moment, so don't let me pass you by
We could be a story in the morning, but we'll be a legend tonight
I'm just a moment, so don't let me pass you by
And they can speak our names in a dead language
'Cause you and I, we're alive
But just for the moment

I'm twice the man that I thought I was yesterday
Half the time, I'm a world away
A flicker of a soul casting silhouettes
On the face of a town that could not get me to stay
And when the spark's gone, former lovers just looking for a bus to throw me under
I'll be the new kid on an old block
A chalk outline on a playground blacktop

I'm just a moment, so don't let me pass you by
We could be a story in the morning, but we'll be a legend tonight
I'm just a moment, so don't let me pass you by
They can speak our names in a dead language
'Cause you and I, we're alive
But just for the moment
Just a moment
