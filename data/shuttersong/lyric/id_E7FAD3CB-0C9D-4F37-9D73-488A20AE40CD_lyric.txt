You pull my strings, and push my soul
You fool my heart with every note
You drop the beat and kiss my face
You make me move, then cut the base
And you work so hard to get me
Just to let me go
Yeah you put me in the spotlight
Just to steal the show
And you try to take me home
Like you're DiMaggio, oh
It's such a joke
Why are you singing me love songs
What good is a love song?
What good is a love song, without the love
Why are you singing me love songs
What good is a love song?
What good is a love song, without the love
Why are we acting like lovers
We dont know each other
Even though we used to rule the world
Why are you singing me love songs
What good is a love song?
A love song without the love
You're so confused, it's getting old
you wear your ring, but leave me cold
You're beautiful, but cause me pain
You play my heart like it's a game
And you work so hard to get me
Just to let me go
Yeah you put me in the spotlight
Just to steal the show
And you try to take me home
Like you're DiMaggio, oh
It's criminal
Why are you singing me love songs
What good is a love song?
What good is a love song, without the love
Why are you singing me love songs
What good is a love song?
What good is a love song, without the love
Why are we acting like lovers
We dont know each other
Even though we used to rule the world
Why are you singing me love songs
What good is a love song?
A love song without the love
This is the bending for the break
When we forget the harmony
This is how water colors fade
Into destined memories
Why are you singing me love songs
What good is a love song?
What good is a love song, without the love
Why are you singing me love songs
What good is a love song?
What good is a love song, without the love
Why are we acting like lovers
We dont know each other
Even though we used to rule the world
Why are you singing me love songs
What good is a love song?
A love song without the love
