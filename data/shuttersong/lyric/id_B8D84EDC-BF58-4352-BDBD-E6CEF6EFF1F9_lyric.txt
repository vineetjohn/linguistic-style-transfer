Give me a flammable light
I'm cold as a match ready to strike
So here I go
Here lies a city on fire

Singing along

Now here I go
It's starting with a spark
And burning to the dark

Now here I go
There is a river I've found
Into the wild

Under the ground
So here I go
A button on a string

And I heard everything
Now here I go
Well...
Oh sweet ignition be my fuse
You have no choice you have to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye I'm on my way

But in the end we all
Come from what's come before
So here I go
Well...
Oh sweet ignition be my fuse
You have no choice you have to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye I'm on my way
I threw it all away because
I had to be what never was
Been so hungry I could lie
Took my word, I took your wine
And held you in my bloody hands
These rattled bones and rubber bands
Washed them in the muddy water
Looking for a dime and found a quarter

But you can't make me change my name
They'll never make me change my name
Pay no mind now ain't that something
Fuck it all I came from nothing

(Interlude / Something From Nothing)
I'm something from nothing
You are my fuse
I'm something from nothing

You are my fuse
It goes oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
It goes oh, oh, oh
All rise!
No you can't make me change my name
You'll never make me change my name
Pay no mind no wait that's something
Fuck it all I came from nothing
I'm something
From nothing
I'm something
From nothing
