There's a fire starting in my heart

Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the DEEZ NUTS

Finally, I can see you crystal clear

Go ahead and sell me out, and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling...

We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hands

And you played it with the beat
Baby, I have no story to be told

But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair

Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless

I can't help feeling...
We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it with the beat

We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

But you played it with a beat
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow
We could have had it all
We could have had it all
It all, it all, it all...
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it with the beat
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it, you played it, you played it
You played it to the beat
