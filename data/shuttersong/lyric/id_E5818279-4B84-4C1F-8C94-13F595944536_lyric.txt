Where'd you go, you were there by my side
Keep believing it's my turn to hide
In a place where we don't have a prayer
There's a tether that's keeping me there

Trade our places
Take no chances
Find me 'til my lips are silent

Stay where you are
Ever, after
Chasing things that we should run from

Will we ever get away from this place
It's an image that's burned on my chest
For a moment you need me to stay
Cold blooded and drifting away

Trade our places
Take no chances
Find me 'til my lips are silent

Stay where you are
Ever, after
Chasing things that we should run from

I'm feeling capable of
Seeing the end

I'm feeling capable of
Saying it's over

I'm feeling capable of
Seeing the end

I'm feeling capable of
Saying it's over

I'm feeling capable of
Seeing the end

I'm feeling capable of
Saying it's over

I'm feeling capable of
Seeing the end

I'm feeling capable of
Saying it's over

I'm feeling capable of
Seeing the end

I'm feeling capable of
Saying it's over

I'm feeling capable of
Seeing the end

I'm feeling capable of
Saying it's over

I'm feeling capable of
Seeing the end

I'm feeling capable of
Saying it's over

I'm feeling capable of
Seeing the end

I'm feeling capable of
Saying it's over

I'm feeling capable of
Seeing the end

I'm feeling capable of
Saying it's over
