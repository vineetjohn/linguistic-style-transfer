We've crossed the line tonight, tonight
And I ease a hello but the heart is goodbye
So drive to the end of the yellow lines

Tell me, cause, tell me
Cause I need to know if it's really gonna be you
Who'll be around and stay around
Take the right from me
Pick a side for me, never hide from me
What's goin' on?
Goin' on, goin' on
Cause I wanna know
I wanna know who to trust if it isn't you
If it isn't you
Then it's alright
It takes time to put your guard down

And once it's down and comfortable
Then it feels right, then it feels right
So when it feels right, say yeah, say yeah
And if you're fallin', I'm fallin'
I'm fallin', fallin' after you
And if you love it, I love it
I love it, I love it, I love it too

Tell me if I doubt you I'm wrong for it, I'm wrong for it
If anybody's in my corner, it's you
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know
That nobody, no face could take you away
Cause there's a life to this thing we got
There's a life to the things we do
To tell the truth, I only want you, baby

And as soon as you feel comfortable
When it feels right, and it feels right, when it feels right
Say yeah
And if you're fallin', I'm fallin'
I'm fallin', fallin' after you
And if you love it, I love it
I love it, I love it, I love it too

And if you're fallin', I'm fallin'
I'm fallin', fallin' after you
And if you love it, I love it
I love it, I love it, I love it too

At the end of it all, I'm coming back to you
At the end of it all, I'm coming back to you
At the end of it all, I'm coming back to you
At the end of it all, I'm coming home to you
At the end of it all, I'm coming back for you
There's no one else

We crossed the line
The line
We crossed the line
The line
We crossed the line
The line
We crossed the line
The line
