"What? What's that?"

Another day,
Of painted walls and football on the TV
No one sees me
I fade away,
Lost inside a memory of someone's life
It wasn't mine

I was already missing before the night I left
Just me and my shadow and all of my regrets
Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I?
Invisible

Wasted days,
Dreaming of the times I know I can't get back
Seems I just lost track
Looking on
As all of life's colours seem to fade to grey
I just walked away

I was already missing before the night I left
Just me and your shadow and all of my regrets
Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I?
Invisible

Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I?
Invisible
Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I?
Invisible

Another day,
The walls are built to keep me safe
I can't escape,
It's too late
