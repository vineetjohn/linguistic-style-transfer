You call to me... and I fall at your feet
How could anyone ask for more
(How could anyone ask for more)
And our time apart... like knives in my heart
How could anyone ask for more
(How could anyone ask for more)

But if there's a pill to help me forget
God knows I haven't found it yet
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to

'Cause trying not to love you only goes so far
Trying not to need you is tearing me apart
Can't see the silver lining from down here on the floor
And I just keep on trying but I don't know what for
'Cause trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more
Only makes me love you more

And this kind of pain... only time takes away
That's why it's harder to let you go
(That's why it's harder to let you go)
And nothing I can do... without thinking of you
That's why it's harder to let you go
(That's why it's harder to let you go)

But if there's a pill to help me forget
God knows I haven't found it yet
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to

'Cause trying not to love you only goes so far
Trying not to need you is tearing me apart
Can't see the silver lining from down here on the floor
And I just keep on trying but I don't know what for
'Cause trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more

So I sit here divided, just talking to myself
Was it something that I did? Was there somebody else?
When a voice from behind me that was fighting back tears
Sat right down beside me and whispered right in my ear
Said I've been dying to tell you

That trying not to love you only went so far
That trying not to need you was tearing me apart
Now I see the silver lining from what we're fighting for
And if we just keep on trying we could be much more
'Cause trying not to love you, yeah
Oh, yeah, trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more
Only makes me love you more
