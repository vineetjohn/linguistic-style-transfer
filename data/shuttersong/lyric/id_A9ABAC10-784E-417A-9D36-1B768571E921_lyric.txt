Lately I found myself thinking (thinking)
Been dreaming about you a lot (a lot)
And up in my head I'm your boyfriend (boyfriend)
But that's one thing you've already got

He drives to school every morning (morning)
While I walk alone in the rain (the rain)
He'd kill me without any warning (warning)
If he took a look in my brain

Would he say he's in L-O-V-E
Well if it was me then I would (I would)
Would he hold you when you're feeling low
Baby you should know that I would (I would)

Would he say he's in L-O-V-E
Well if it was me then I would (I would)
Would he hold you when you're feeling low
Baby you should know that I would

Back in my head we were kissing
I thought things were going alright (alright, alright, alright)
With a sign on my back saying kick me
Reality ruined my life

(On the top of the world!)

Feels like I'm constantly playing
A game that I'm destined to lose
Cause I can't compete with your boyfriend
He's got 27 tattoos

Would he say he's in L-O-V-E
Well if it was me then I would (I would)
Would he hold you when you're feeling low
Baby you should know that I would (I would)

Would he say he's in L-O-V-E
Well if it was me then I would (I would)
Would he hold you when you're feeling low
Baby you should know that I would

I would, I would

Would he please you
Would he kiss you
Would he treat you like I would
Would he touch you
Would he need you
Would he love you like I would

Would he say he's in L-O-V-E
Well if it was me then I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low

I would, I would
