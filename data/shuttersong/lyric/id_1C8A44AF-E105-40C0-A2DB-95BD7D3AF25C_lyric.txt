I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was trying to keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I found my way back 'round

They tell me I should fix my grill cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing but it's funny how
My shit is crooked look at how far I done got without it
I keep my twisted grill, just to show them kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Oh, you a woman? I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you
Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror but its clear that you can't face what's wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paint brush on
Your roommate yelling,"Why  you gotta take so long?"
What it's  like to have  a crooked smile
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
 You're the one that was tryna keep me way down
 Like  a  sun  all  you  know if I'm on my way down
To  all the women with the flaws,  know it's hard my darling
 You wonder why  you're lonely and your man's not calling
 You keep falling victim cause  you're insecure
And when I tell  you that  you're beautiful  you can't be sure
Cause  you see that no one wants  you back and it got  you asking
So  all  you see is what  you lacking,
not what  you packing
Take it from  a man that loves what  you got
And baby  you're  a star,
don't let 'em tell  you  you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? if it's not, girl  you don't care
Cause what's real is something that the eyes can't see
That the hands can¡¯t touch,
that them broads can¡¯t be, and that¡¯s  you
Never let 'em see  you frown
And if  you need  a friend to pick  you up, I¡¯ll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell  you ain¡¯t laughed in  a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
 You're the one that was tryna keep me way down
 Like  a  sun  all  you  know if I'm on my way down
Crooked smile, we could style on 'em (back 'round)
Crooked smile, we could style on 'em (back 'round)
 You¡¯re the one that was trying to keep me way down.
 Like the  sun, I  know  you  know I found my way back round
We only fronting  like the people on the screen
 You  know them movie stars,
picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ¡®em
Look at the nation, that¡¯s  a crooked
smile braces couldn¡¯t even straighten
Seem  like half the race is either on probation, or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, cause we in hell already
I asked if my skin pale,
would I then sell  like Eminem or Adele?
Yo one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck  all of that beef shit, nigga let¡¯s make  a mil
Hey
