I woke up and saw the sun today
You came by without a warning
You put a smile on my face
I want that for every morning
What is it I'm feeling?
'Cause I can't let it go
If seeing is believing
Then I already know
I'm falling fast
I hope this lasts
I'm falling hard
For you
I say, let's
Take a chance
Take it while we can
I know you
Feel it too
I'm falling fast
I'm falling fast
Doesn't matter what we do
You make everything
Seem brighter
I never knew I needed you
Like a sad song needs
A sea of lighters
What is it I'm feeling?
'Cause I can't let it go
If seeing is believing
I already know
I'm falling fast
God
I hope this lasts
'Cause
I'm falling hard for you
I say, let's
Take a chance
Take it while we can
'Cause
I know you feel it too
I'm falling fast
I'm falling fast
I hope you know
I hope it lasts
I'm falling hard
I'm falling fast
We can go
No holding back
For you
I hope you know
I hope it lasts
I'm falling hard
I'm falling fast
For you
We can go
No holding back
I'm falling fast
I hope this lasts
I'm falling hard for you
I say, let's
Take a chance
Take it while we can
I know you feel it too
I'm falling fast
I'm falling fast
