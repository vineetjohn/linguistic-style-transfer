
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you.

Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up
Let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up
It's grand, just holding your hand
We're riding along with a song

Of a wintery fairy land.

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take the road before us
And sing a or two

Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you.

There's a birthday party
At the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs

We love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch
The chestnuts pop; Pop! Pop! Pop!

There's a happy feeling
Nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffee
And the pumpkin pie

It'll nearly be like a picture print
By Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things
We remember all through our lives!

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring-ting-tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling, \
