The wound heals but it never does
That's cause you're at war with love
You're at war with love

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change

These battle

Never let a wound ruin me
But I feel like ruins wooing me
Arrow holes that never close from cupid on a shooting spree
Feeling stupid cause I know it ain't no you and me

But when you're trying to beat the odds up
Been trying to keep your nods up and you know that you should know

And let her go but the fear of the unknown
Holding another lover strong sends you back into the zone
With no Tom Hanks to bring you home

A lover not a fighter on the frontline with a poem
Trying to write yourself a rifle
Maybe sharpen up a song

To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone
I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched
I wish that I could stop loving you so much

Cause I'm the only one that's trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her

I wish you weren't the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
Cause it'll never be over, until you tell me it's over

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away

They ain't never gonna change
These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away

They ain't never gonna change
These battle
You shouldn't have but you said it
It shouldn't have happened but you let it
Now you're down on the ground screaming medic
The only thing that comes is the post-traumatic stresses
Shields, body armors and vests
Don't properly work, that's why you're in a locker full of hurt
The enemy within and all the fires from your friends
The best medicine is to probably just let her win
I wish I couldn't feel, I wish I couldn't love
I wish that I could stop cause it hurts so much
And I'm the only one that's trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her
I wish you weren't the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
Cause it'll never be over, until you tell me it's over
These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle
Cause you've set me on fire
I've never felt so alive, yeah
Hoping wounds heal, but it never does
That's because you're at war with love
And I'm at the point of breaking
And it's impossible to shake it
See, you hoped the wound heals, but it never does
That's cause you're at war with love
Hope it heals, but it never does
These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle
