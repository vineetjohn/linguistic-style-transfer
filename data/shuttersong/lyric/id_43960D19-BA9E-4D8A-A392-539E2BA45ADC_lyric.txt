If I sing, but don't have love
I waste my breath with every song
I bring an empty voice, a hollow noise
If I speak with a silver tongue
Convince a crowd, but don't have love
I leave a bitter taste with every word I say

So let my life be the proof of Your love
Let my love look like You, and what You're made of
How You lived, how You died
Love is sacrifice
So let my life be the proof
The proof of Your love

If I give to a needy soul
But don't have love, then who is poor?
It seems all the poverty is found in me

So let my life be the proof of Your love
Let my love look like You, and what You're made of
How You lived, how You died
Love is sacrifice
So let my life be the proof
The proof of Your love

When it's all said and done
When we sing our final song

Only love remains

Only love remains

Let my life be the proof
The proof of Your love
Let my love look like You, and what You're made of
How You lived, how You died
Love is sacrifice
So let my life be the proof
The proof of Your love
