Get jazzy on it

[Jason Derulo:]
I'm that flight that you get on, international
First class seat on my lap girl, riding comfortable

'Cause I know what the girl them need,
New York to Haiti
I got lipstick stamps on my passport,
You make it hard to leave

[Jason Derulo:]
Been around the world, don't speak their language
But your booty don't need explaining
All I really need to understand is
When you will talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Get jazzy on it

[Jason Derulo:]
You know the words to my songs
No habla inglés
Our conversations ain't long
But you know what is

I know what the girl them want,
London to Taiwan
I got lipstick stamps on my passport
I think I need a new one

[Jason Derulo:]
Been around the world, don't speak their language
But your booty don't need explaining
All I really need to understand is
When you will talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me

[Jason Derulo:]
Uno, met your friend in Rio
Dos, she was all on me-oh
Tres, we can ménage à three though
Quatro, ooh (2 Chainz!)

[2 Chainz:]
Dos Cadenas, close to genius
Sold out arenas, you can suck my penis
Gilbert Arenas, guns on deck
Chest to chest, tongue on neck
International oral sex
Every picture I take, I pose a threat
Bought a jet, what do you expect?
Her pussy's so good I bought her a pet
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it
Got her saved in my phone under "Big Booty"
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it
Got her saved in my phone under "Big Booty"

All I really need to understand is
When you will talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me (you you you)
Talk dirty to me (yeah yeah)
Talk dirty to me (talk to me)
Talk dirty to me (oh yeah)
Get jazzy on it

What? I don't understand!
