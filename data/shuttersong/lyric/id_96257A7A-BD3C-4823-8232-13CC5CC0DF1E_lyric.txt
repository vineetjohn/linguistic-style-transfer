I don't work hard when it's easy
I put in work when it's hard
Girl they never believed in love until I had yours
This is more than a season
And I'm not just sprung
I'm not afraid to tell you that you're the one
But when I wake up thinking 'bout
The one that I can run to when I'm feeling down
Life is so good when you're around
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now
Cause I'll take you home to mama, let you meet my friends
Cause you don't come with drama
So I want you till the world ends
You're way more than worth it
But I don't feel like I deserve it
You got the pieces
You're my kind of perfect
