We were running through the town 
Our senses had been drowned 
A place we hadn't been before 

We learned to live and then 
Our freedom came to an end 
We have to break down this wall 
Too young to live a lie 
Look into my eyes 

Ready, set, go it's time to run 
The sky is changing we are warned 
Together we can make it while the world is crashing down 
Don't you turn around 

We are looking back again 
Our loneliness and pain 
Never been so wide awake 

Breathe slowly in and out 
I can see the morning break 
Too young to live a lie 
Look into my eyes 

Ready, set, go it's time to run 
The sky is changing we are warned 
Together we can make it while the world is crashing down 
Don't you turn around 

Leave it all behind you now 
The final wall is breaking down 
We are all it's all about 
Nothing can stop us now 

I promise you right know 
I never let you down 
Ready, set, go it's time to run 
The sky is changing we are warned 
Together we can make it while the world is crashing down 
Don't turn around 

Ready, set, go it's time to run 
The sky is changing we are warned 
Together we can make it while the world is crashing down 
Don't you turn around 

Don't you turn around 
Don't you turn around
