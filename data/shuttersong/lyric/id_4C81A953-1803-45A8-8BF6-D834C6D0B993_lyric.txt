Get that bodies rockin from side to side (side to side)
Thank God the week is done
I feel like a zombie gone back to life (back to life)

Ain't I seen you before?
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes

Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again

Not tomorrow that just right now, now, now, now, now, now
Gonna set the roof on fire
Gonna burn this down, down, down, down, down, down
Hands up, when the music drops
We both put our hands up
Put your hands on my body
Swear I seen you before

Hear no evil, or speak no evil, or see no evil
