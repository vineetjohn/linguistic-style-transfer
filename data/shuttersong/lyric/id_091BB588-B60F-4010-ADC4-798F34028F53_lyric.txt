Come on my sweet longing
Take me from a ride
I know where we're going
And I don't mind the night

Same old town, same dull street
Same sad eyes, same old greed
But a change will come and move me on
I can feel it now I'm ready to run
Ready to run

There's a sign in the sky
And as I'm reaching high
I can feel I can make it tonight
I've been waiting so long
For a feeling so strong
For a chance to walk into the light

Some believes in angels
Others go insane
Some say just be patient
Till someone calls your name

I don't pray, don't pretend
I won't wait until the end
Now a change will come and move me on
I can feel it now I'm ready to run

There's a sign in the sky
And as I'm reaching high
I can feel I can make it tonight
I've been waiting so long
For a feeling so strong
For a chance to walk into the light
