Bye baby, they ain't fly baby
Looking at the whip frame, that's a nice 'Cedes
Used to throw it to me, like Tom Brady
With the long blonde hair, that's Marcia Brady
I'm all about your Lately Chelsea high Handler, handle her
Got your legs racing hard on vacation
No exaggeration, said you amazing
Moving too fast, can't pace it

Hey boy, when I first met you
Thought it was special

Hey boy, up at Two Lover's Point
When I kissed you I meant it

Can we go back? (I'll make it happen though)
Boy can we go back? (let's do it soon boo)

So I'mma have to do you better than the first time

You gotta nigga blowing up your caller ID
Guess it was all a set up, you got me
