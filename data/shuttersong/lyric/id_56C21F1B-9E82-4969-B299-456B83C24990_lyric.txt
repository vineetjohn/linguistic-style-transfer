It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it
When I see you again
We've come a long way
From where we began
I'll tell you all about it
When I see you again
When I see you again

Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew
Good things we've been through
That I'll be standing right here talking to you
About another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up
Look at things different see the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place

How could we not talk about family
When family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you're going to be with me
For the last ride

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it
When I see you again
We've come a long way
From where we began
I'll tell you all about it
When I see you again
When I see you again

First you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turn to a friendship
A friendship turn into a bond
And that bond will never be broken
And love will never get lost

And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reach
So remember me when I'm gone

How could we not talk about family
When family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you
Were standing there by my side
And now you're going to be with me
For the last ride

So let the light guide your way
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it
When I see you again
We've come a long way
From where we began
I'll tell you all about it
When I see you again...
