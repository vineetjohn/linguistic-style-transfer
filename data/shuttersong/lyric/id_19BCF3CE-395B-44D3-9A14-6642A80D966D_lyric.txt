 Something's not right
 Something 's  not  right
We had forever
We never got it together
I waited for you
For you I made it better
They kept telling me that it was unlikely
All I had to do was keep you beside me
 Something 's  not  right
There aren 't many stars in the sky tonight
 Something 's  not  right
Cause I know that it 's day but it 's dark outside
And I feel a weight in my heart tonight
We had forever
We never got it together
I waited for you
For you I made it better
They kept telling me that it was unlikely
All I had to do was keep you beside me
 Something 's  not  right
There aren 't many stars in the sky tonight
 Something 's  not  right
Cause I know that it 's day but it 's dark outside
Like the feeling of rain on a Summer light
O-o-o-o-o-oh
A-a-a-a-a-ah
Mmmm
