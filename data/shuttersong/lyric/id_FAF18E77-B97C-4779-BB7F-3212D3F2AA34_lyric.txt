Is your head spinning?
Is your heart racing?
Is there fire in your veins?

Are your bones burning?
Is your skin yearning?
'Cause you're driving me insane

I kinda feel like I feel like I saw the light
You got me way up a thousand miles
Can we stay right here in this atmosphere like we're flying out in space?

Don't look down
Up this high, we'll never hit the ground
Don't look down
See that sky, we're gonna reach it now

Do you feel the lightning inside of you?
Will you follow through if I fall for you?
Don't look down
Up this high, we'll never hit the ground

Are your hands shaking?
Are your fears breaking?
Are you climbing over walls?

Are the times changing?
Is the noise fading?
'Cause I wanna get it all

I kinda feel like I feel like I saw the light
You got me way up a thousand miles
Can we stay right here in this atmosphere?
Or are you afraid to fall?

Don't look down
Up this high, we'll never hit the ground
Don't look down
See that sky, we're gonna reach it now

Do you feel the lightning inside of you?
Will you follow through if I fall for you?
Don't look down
Up this high, we'll never hit the ground

Don't look down

Do you feel the lightning inside of you?
Will you follow through if I fall for you?
Don't look down
Up this high, we'll never hit the ground
