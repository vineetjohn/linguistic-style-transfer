come on girl
Hey pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever
Like I've never, ever known

You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk
Your talk, your dress
I feel your fever
From miles around
I'll pick you up in my car
And we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby
And tell me twice
That you're the one for me
The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)

You really turn me on

(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet
(You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone)
I like the feelin' you're givin' me

Just hold me baby and I'm in ecstasy
Oh I'll be workin' from nine to five

To buy you things to keep you by my side
I never felt so in love before
Just promise baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me

The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on

(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet
(You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone)
Go on girl!
Go on! Hee! Hee! Aaow!

Go on girl!
I never felt so in love before
Promise baby, you'll love me forevermore

I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied

'Cause you're the one for me...
The way you make me feel

(The way you make me feel)

You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet
(You knock me off of my feet)

My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone)

ain't nobody's business
the way you make me feel
ain't nobody's business
ain't nobody's business
you really turn me on
you knock me off of my feet
my lonely days are gone
The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone
the way you make me feel
(You really turn me on)
(You knock me off of my feet)
(My lonely days are gone)
Give it to me - give me some time
Come on be my girl - I wanna
be with mine
Ain't nobody's business
(You knock me off of my feet)
