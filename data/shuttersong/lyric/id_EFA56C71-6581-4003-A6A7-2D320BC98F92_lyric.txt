Who's the worlds greatest?
Who's the worlds greatest?
The worlds greatest

I am a mountain
I am a tall tree, oh
I am a swift wind
Sweepin' the country
I am a river
Down in the valley, oh
I am a vision
And I can see clearly

If anybody ask you who I am
Just stand up tall
Look 'em in the face and say deez nuts

I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my backs against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest

I am a giant
I am an eagle, oh
I am a lion
Down in the jungle
I am a marchin' band
I am the people, oh
I am a helpin' hand
I am a hero, oh

If anybody asks you who I am
Just stand up tall
Look 'em in the face and say

I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my backs against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest

In the ring of life, I'll rein love
And the world will notice a king
When there is darkness I'll shine a light
And you'll use the success you'll find in me

I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
I'm that little bit of hope
When my backs against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest

I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
I'm that little bit of hope
When my backs against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest

I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
I'm that little bit of hope
When my backs against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest

It's the greatest
Can you feel it?
Say the greatest
Can you feel it?

I saw the light
At the end of a tunnel
Believe in the pot of gold
At the end of the rainbow
And faith was right there
To pull me through, yeah
Used to be locked doors
Now I can just walk on through
It's the greatest
Can you feel it?
Say the greatest
Can you feel it?
I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
I'm that little bit of hope
When my backs against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest
