Mom and Dad they quite don't
understand it
All the kids they laugh as if they planned it
Why do girls want to pierce their nose
And walk around in torn pantyhose
oh yeah
I like the ones who say they listen
to the punk rock
I like the kids who fight against how
they were brought up
They hate the trends and think it's
fucked to care.
Its cool when they piss people off with
what they wear, oh yeah
So give me one good reason
Why we need to be like them
Kids will have fun and offend
They don't want to and don't fit in
Hate the jocks, the preps, the
hippie-fuckin' scumbags
Heavy-metalers with their awful
pussy hair bands
Counting seconds until we can get away
Ditchin' school almost every single day
oh yeah
So give me one good reason
Why we need to be like them
Kids will have fun and offend
They don't want to and don't fit in
Give me one good reason
why we need to be like them
Kids will have fun and offend
They don't want to and don't fit in
