Seems like it was yesterday
When I saw your face
You told me how proud you were

But I walked away
If only I knew
What I know today
Ooh, ooh

I would hold you in my arms
I would take the pain away
Thank you for all you've done

Forgive all your mistakes
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To hear your voice again

Sometimes I wanna call you
But I know you won't be there
Oh, I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do

And I've hurt myself by hurting you
Some days I feel broke inside
But I won't admit

Sometimes I just wanna hide
Because it's you I miss
And it's so hard to say goodbye

When it comes to this
Ooh, yeah
Would you tell me I was wrong?
“
For everything I just couldn't do
— Christina Aguilera

Would you help me understand?
Are you looking down upon me?
Are you proud of who I am?
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To have just one more chance
To look into your eyes
And see you looking back
Oh
I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself
Ooh
If I had just one more day
I would tell you how much that I've missed you
Since you've been away
Oh, it's dangerous
It's so out of line
To try and turn back time
I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself
By hurting you
