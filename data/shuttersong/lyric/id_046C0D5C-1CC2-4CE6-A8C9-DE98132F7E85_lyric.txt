This will be the day
That u will hear me say
That I will never run away
I am here for u
Love is meant for two
Now tell me what u're gonna do

If I gave u diamonds and pearls
Would u be a happy boy or a girl
If I could I would give u the world
But all I can do is just offer u my love

Which one of us is right
If we always fight
Why can't we just let love decide
(Let love decide)
Am I the weaker man
Because I understand
That love must be the master plan
(Love is the master plan)

If I gave u diamonds and pearls
Would u be a happy boy or a girl
If I could I would give u the world
But all I can do is just offer u my love

D to the I to the A to the M
O to the N to the D to the pearls of love
D to the I to the A to the M
(To the M)
O to the N to the D to the pearls of love

There will come a time
(There will come a time)
When love will blow your mind
(Your mind)
And everything u'll look 4 u'll find
(Take a look inside, yeah)
That will be the time
(That'll be the time)
That everything will shine
(Forever)
So bright it makes u colorblind
(U will be color blind)

If I gave u diamonds and pearls
Would u be a happy boy or a girl
If I could I would give u the world
All I can do is just offer u my love

If I gave u diamonds and pearls
(Pearls)
Would u be a happy boy or a girl
(Yeah, yeah)
If I could I would give u the world
(Give u the world)
All I can do is just offer u my love
(All I can do)

If I gave u diamonds and pearls
(Diamonds)
Would u be, would u, would u
(Would u, would u
Would u be happy little baby)
A happy boy or a girl
(If I could I would)
Give u the world.
