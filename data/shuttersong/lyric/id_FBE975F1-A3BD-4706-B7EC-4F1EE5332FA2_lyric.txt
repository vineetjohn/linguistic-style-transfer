You feel the weight of imposition
Bear heavy on your own decision, decision
Fate to face, they multiply
The crush of language and the cedent school ties
The subtle angles of tradition, tradition

Eton for portent
St. Paul's for context
Oxbridge for vision
No need to make this popular
One man for progress
One man for past tense
One man for vision

No need to make this popular

With your school cap blowing in the breeze
It's about time
That you made education not a funnel but a wide line
NEET to Youth

As gove to tact
A million faces that are staring straight past
A mix of ignorance and fission, fission

Eton for portent
St. Paul's for context
Oxbridge for vision
No need to make this popular

One man for progress
One man for past tense
One man for vision
No need to make this popular

I'd rather starve than become a member of your old boy's club
Sooner depart than than see the ascension of the Bullingdon
Because I want to make a breakthrough
A tired addendum to working hard
I'd rather starve than become a member of your old boy's club
Because I want to make a breakthrough
A tired addendum to working hard
I'd rather starve than become a member of your old boy's club
Because I want to make a breakthrough
A tired addendum to working hard
Because I want to make a breakthrough
A tired addendum to working hard
