I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant
And Bel-Air now
Hot summer nights mid July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, the city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful
Will you still love me
When I got nothing but my aching soul
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will
I've seen the world, lit it up
As my stage now
Channeling angels in
The new age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful
Will you still love me
When I got nothing but my aching soul
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will
