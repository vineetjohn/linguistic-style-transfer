Wild thing
You make my heart sing
You make everything, groovy
Wild thing

Wild thing, I think I love you
But I wanna know for sure
So come on, and hold me tight
I love you

Wild thing
You make my heart sing
You make everything, groovy
Wild thing

Wild thing, I think you move me
But I wanna know for sure
So come on, and hold me tight
You move me

Wild thing
You make my heart sing
You make everything, groovy
Wild thing

Come on, come on, wild thing
Shake it, shake it, wild thing
