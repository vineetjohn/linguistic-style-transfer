Mr. Worldwide
T-Pain
El que no olle consejo
No llega a viejo
So listen up

Ooh La La La
Let her go ...
If your girl wanna play, let her go, so let her go (La la la¡­)
If your girl wanna play, let her go, so let her go (La la la¡­)
If your girl wanna play, let her go, so let her go (La la la¡­)
If your girl wanna play, let her go

[Chorus - T-Pain]
Hey baby girl what you doing tonight
I wanna see what you got in store
Hey baby - giving it your all when you¡¯re dancing on me
I wanna see if you can give me some more
Hey baby - you can be my girl I can be your man
and we can pump this jam however you want
Hey baby, pump it from the side pump it upside down
or we can pump it from the back to the front
Hey baby

Ooh baby baby, La La La La La La La.. (Aaah)
Ooh baby baby, La La La La La La La.. (Aaah)
Ooh baby baby, La La La La La La La.. (Aaah)
Ooh baby baby, La La La La La La La.. (Hey Baby)

Ooh drop it to the floor, make me wanna say it
Yeah you can shake some more, make me wanna say it
Ooh you got it, because you make me wanna say
Don¡¯t stop it - I want you tonight

I¡¯m a Dade county,
self paid, self made millionaire
I used to play around the world,
now I¡¯m around the world - getting paid
Girl problems, no problems
don't hate the game, that won¡¯t solve em
I wanna get with you mami,
now let me see what the lord split you dale

[Chorus - T-Pain]
Hey baby girl what you doing tonight
I wanna see what you got in store
Hey baby - giving it you all when you¡¯re dancin¡¯ on me
I wanna see if you can give me some more
Hey baby - you can be my girl I can be your man
and we can pump this jam however you want
Hey baby, pump it from the side pump it upside down

Make money, make money
this chico right here gotta eat, baby
You scared money - don¡¯t make money,
that¡¯s how it goes in the street baby
But enough about the nonsense,
baby girl take a shot to your conscience
not a goon or a goblin, but I¡¯m a monster
'Cause I hit all the baddest women in the world, gangster
Ooh baby, baby, La La La La La La La [x4]

Hey Baby
Ooh drop it to the floor, make me wanna say it
Yeah you can shake some more, make me wanna say it
Ooh you got it, because you make me wanna say
Don¡¯t stop it - I want you tonight
