Just the Way You Are - Bruno Mars
Oh her eyes  her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair  her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah I know  I know
When I compliment her
She won't believe me
And it's so  it's so
Sad to think she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me do I look okay
I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl  you're amazing
Just the way you are
The way you are
The way you are
The way you are
The way you are
The way you are
The way you are
The way you are
The way you are
The way you are
The way you are
The way you are
The way you are
The way you are
The way you are
The way you are
The way you are
The way you are
The way you are
The way you are
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile 
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
