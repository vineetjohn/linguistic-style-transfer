Good Enough - Little Mix
I am the time that you left in the dust
I am the future you lost in the past
Seems like I never come hate
With no receipt  I disappear
You stole the love that I saved for myself
And I watched you give it to somebody else
But these scars no longer I hide
I found the light you shut inside
Couldn't love me if you tried
Am I still not good enough 
Am I still not worth that much 
I'm sorry for the way my life turned out
Sorry for the smile I'm wearing now
Guess I'm still not good enough
Does it burn 
Knowing I used all the pain
Does it hurt 
Knowing you blew to my flame
Don't look back
Don't need your regrets
Think are you let my love behind
Couldn't change me if you tried
Am I still not good enough 
Am I still not worth that much 
I'm sorry for the way my life turned out
Sorry for the smile I'm wearing now
Guess I'm still not good enough
Raise your cups
'Cause I know my worth
Those words you made I called you waiting nothing  yeah
Your love worth it
And I never win
You want the best
So sorry that's clearly not me
This is all I can be
Am I still not good enough 
Am I still not worth that much 
I'm sorry for the way my life turned out
Sorry for the smile I'm wearing now
Guess I'm still not good enough
