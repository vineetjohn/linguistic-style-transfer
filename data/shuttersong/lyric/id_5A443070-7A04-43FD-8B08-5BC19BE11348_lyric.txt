Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow.
Sometimes I believe, at times I'm rational.
I can fly high, I can go low.
Today I got a million,
Tomorrow, I don't know.

Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow.
Sometimes I believe, at times I'm rational.
I can fly high, I can go low.
Today I got a million, Tomorrow, I don't know.

Stop claiming what you own and think about the show.
We're all playing the same game, waiting on our loan.
We're unknown and known, special and a clone.
Hate will make you cautious, love will make you glow.

Make me feel the warmth
make me feel the cold
It's written in our story
it's written on the walls
This is our call, we rise and we fall
Dancin' in the moonlight,
don't we have it all?
