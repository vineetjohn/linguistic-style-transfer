She's got tangled hair and cigarettes
Cursing like a sailor on the ocean in her eyes
But she's not my type at all
Five star dinner with a t-shirt on
Laughing too loud and a bit too long
And I
Think she's not my type at all
She's got pieces of me wrapped around her fingertips
Started slow but moving quickly to her heaven
No she's not my type at all
No she's not my type at all
She's got a plastic ring on her left hand from her boyfriend
And a chip on her shoulder from her mom
And she's not my type at all
It's all so right
It's all so wrong
Probably be gone by the end of this song
Cause she's not my type at all
She's got pieces of me wrapped around her fingertips
Started slow but moving quickly to her heaven
Cause she's not my type at all
No she's not my type at all
No she's not, no she's not, no she's not
No she's not my type at all
I am something else
When she says my name
Heaven bound
I lose myself
But she's not my type at all
No she's not my type at all
She's got pieces of me wrapped around her finger.
She's got pieces wrapped around her fingertips
Started slow but moving quickly to her heaven
Heaven
No she's not my type at all
No she's not my type at all
No she's not my type at all
