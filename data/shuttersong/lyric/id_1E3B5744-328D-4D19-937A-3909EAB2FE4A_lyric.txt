Every street corner you'll hear, you can hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing, meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear, you can hear

Silver bells, silver bells, silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling, hear them sing, hear them sing
Soon it will be Christmas day

Strings of streetlights even stop lights blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch, this is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle you'll hear, you can hear

Silver bells, the corner Santa Claus, silver bells, is busy now because
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, you'll hear it in the air, hear them ring, you'll hear it everywhere
Soon it will be Christmas day
Very soon it will be Christmas day
