You can't fool me
I saw you when you came out
You got your momma's taste
But you got my mouth

You will always have a part of me
Nobody else is ever gonna see
Gracie girl

With your cards to your chest
Walking on your toes
What you got in the box
Only Gracie knows

And I would never try to make you be
Anything you didn't really wanna be
Gracie girl

Life flies by in seconds
You're not a baby
Gracie, you're my friend
You'll be a lady soon
But until then
You gotta do what I say

You nodded off in my arms watching TV
I won't move you an inch
Even though my arm's asleep

One day you're gonna wanna go
I hope we taught you everything
You need to know
Gracie girl
There will always be a part of me
Nobody else is ever gonna see
But you and me
My little girl
My Gracie girl
