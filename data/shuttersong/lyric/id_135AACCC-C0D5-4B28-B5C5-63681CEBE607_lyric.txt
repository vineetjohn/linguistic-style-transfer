Let's stay here today,
stay here forever.
And bring on the rain.
With you, I've got cover.

When it's cold outside,
I know I'm not the only one alone.
And you're the only reason
why I'll ever come back home.

Baby, let's turn it up now.
Turn me on, and turn it up now.
Baby, let's turn it up now.
Turn me on, and turn it up now.
I'm going crazy without you here lately.
I've been going crazy for you.
Crazy for you.

Breathe slow, I can feel your tremble.
Tonight, I'll listen and I'll follow.
My words skip, I fall, I crumble.
Don't say a word, 'cause I know.

Baby, let's turn it up now.
Turn me on, and turn it up now.
Baby, let's turn it up now.
Turn me on, and turn it up now.
I'm going crazy without you here lately.
I've been going crazy for you.
Crazy for you.

I feel so lost at sea,
but know the wave that'll carry me back to safety.
And I feel so lost at sea,
but you're the wave that'll carry me back to safety.

(Baby, turn it up now, turn me on)
Turn it up now.

Baby, let's turn it up now.
Turn me on, and turn it up now.
I'm going crazy without you here lately.
I've been going crazy for you.
Crazy for you.

Let's turn it up,
let's turn it up now.
(Turn it up, turn it up)

Baby, let's turn it up.
(Turn it up, turn it up, up, up)
I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy,
I've been going crazy for you.
Lately I've been missing you.
