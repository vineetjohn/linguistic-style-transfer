I never needed you to be strong
I never needed you for pointing out my wrongs
I never needed pain
I never needed strain
My love for you was strong enough, you should have known

I never needed you for judgment
I never needed you to question what I spend
I never asked for help
I take care of myself
I don't know why you think you've got a hold on me

And it's a little late for conversations
There isn't anything for you to say
And my eyes hurt, hands shiver
So look at me and listen to me
Because

I don't want to stay another minute
I don't want you to say a single word
Hush hush; hush hush
There is no other way I get the final say
Because
I don't want to do this any longer
I don't want you
There's nothing left to say
Hush hush; hush hush
I've already spoken
Our love is broken
Baby, hush hush

I never needed your corrections
On everything from how I act to what I say
I never needed words
I never needed hurt
I never needed you to be there everyday

I'm sorry for the way I let go
Of everything I wanted when you came along
But I am never beaten,
Broken not defeated
I know next to you is not where I belong

And it's a little late for explanations
There isn't anything that you can do
And my eyes hurt, hands shiver
So you will listen when I say
Baby

I don't want to stay another minute
I don't want you to say a single word
Hush hush; hush hush
There is no other way I get the final say
Because
I don't want to stay another minute
I don't want you to say a single word
Hush hush; hush hush
There is no other way I get the final say
Because
I don't want to do this any longer
I don't want you
There's nothing left to say
Hush hush; hush hush
I've already spoken
Our love is broken
Baby, hush hush

First I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
But I spent oh so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
But I grew strong
I learned how to carry on

Hush Hush; Hush Hush

I've already spoken
Our love is broken
Baby

Oh no, now I,
I will survive
As long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give
And I will survive
I will survive

Hush Hush; Hush Hush

There is no other way I get the final say

I don't want to do this any longer
I don't want you
There's nothing left to say
Hush hush; hush hush
I've already spoken
Our love is broken
Baby, hush hush
