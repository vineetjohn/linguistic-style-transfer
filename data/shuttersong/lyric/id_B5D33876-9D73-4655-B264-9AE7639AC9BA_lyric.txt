When light goes down,
I see no reason
For you to cry.
We've been through this before
In every time,
in every season
God knows I've tried
So please don't ask for more.
Can't you see it in my eyes
This might be our last goodbye
Carrie, Carrie,
things they change my friend
Carrie, Carrie,
maybe we'll meet again

I read your mind,
with no intentions
Of being unkind,
I wish I could explain

It all takes time,
a whole lot of patience
If it's a crime,
how come I feel no pain.

Can't you see it in my eyes
This might be our last goodbye
Carrie, Carrie,
things they change my friend
Carrie, Carrie,
maybe we'll meet again

Can't you see it in my eyes
This might be our last goodbye
Carrie, Carrie,
things they change
Carrie, Carrie, Carrie
Carrie, Carrie,
maybe we'll meet again
or somewhere again

when lights go down.
