Money rains from the sky above
But keep the change cuz I've got enough 
A little time and some tenderness 
You'll never buy my love

No other thing that's as precious to 
(No other! There's no other!)
And a heart that's real and a heart that's true 
Somethin' that you've got to love this girl 

They'll by them 
Or them over 
They'll by them you 
O-or them over 
They'll by them you 
Or them over 
They'll by them you 
Or them over 

These treasures don't really come for free 
Your paychecks don't mean that much to me 
Just take my hand and hold me tight 
You'll never buy my love 

You buy me this and you buy me that 
(To win over! Win me over!)
You got me wrong and that's a fact 
Somethin' that you've got to love this 

Will you realize when I'm gone 
That I dance to a different song 
Will you realize when I'm gone 
That I dance to a different song 
It's a shame but I've got to go 

They'll by them 
Or them over 
They'll by them you 
O-or them over 
They'll by them you 
Or them over 
They'll by them you 
Or them over
