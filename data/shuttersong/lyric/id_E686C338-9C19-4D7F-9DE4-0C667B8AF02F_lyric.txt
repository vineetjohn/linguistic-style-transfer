We always find a way to fuck things up
At the worst time you know
We've never been the smartest

You know you could have anyone
But standing on the edge I said
I don't want no one else

They say, it's time to grow up
And stop with these foolish games
But I say, they're wrong

She said go, go, go, I don't wanna take it slow
There's plenty of time for us to finally get it right
Why don't we crash and burn tonight?

Shoulda know we were too young to feel this much
It could kill us, you know
My nearly departed

Said you were currupting me
I was naive, but no one knew
I kept it to myself

They say, it's time to grow up
And stop with these foolish games
But I say, they're wrong

She said go, go, go, I don't wanna take it slow
There's plenty of time for us to finally get it right
Why don't we crash and burn tonight?

This is how we'll always be
And they will see that we were right
And they were wrong
So I'll put it in a song
So you can sing along

She said go, go, go, I don't wanna take it slow
She said go, go, go, I don't wanna take it slow

Go, go, go, I don't wanna take it slow
There's plenty of time for us to finally get it right
Why don't we crash and burn tonight

Crash and burn tonight!
