She ought to do right by me

Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me

I think I'm gonna be sad

She said that living with me
Was bringing her down, yeah
For she would never be free
When I was around, oh

She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

My baby don't care
