I know exactly how you feel
It doesn't matter what you say
I see the sun begin to set
And we gotta, gotta get away
I gotta patch of open road
I already miss you with all of my soul
So before we both get old
I think we gotta, gotta get away

I keep wishing for all the tickets
Stack 'em on my wall
Let's rip them down
And leave the town before the cops can call
And bring us back
Cover our tracks in the dust
I think we must

Take on the world
Let's go crazy
Love will tell us where to go
I'll be your girl, be my baby
Love will tell us where to go
Oh oh oh through a dark night
Oh oh oh without a sunrise
Oh oh oh and we will be alright
Love will tell us where to go
Love will tell us where to go
Love will tell us where to go

The wheels on this train keep turning
We're flying with the birds
And the worlds so bright
It hurts when we're on the getaway
I'm the Bonnie to your Clyde
You're the mood and I'm the tide
I, I want this for all of my life
Since the night that we got away

I keep wishing for all the tickets
Stack 'em on my wall
Let's rip them down
And leave the town before the cops can call
And bring us back
Cover our tracks in the dust
I think we must

Take on the world
Let's go crazy
Love will tell us where to go
I'll be your girl, be my baby
Love will tell us where to go
Oh oh oh through a dark night
Oh oh oh without a sunrise
Oh oh oh and we will be alright
Love will tell us where to go
Love will tell us where to go
Love will tell us where to go

When things get rough
When we have loved
We've got enough to tell us where to go
When we get lost
When love is all that we got
To tell us where to go
Then we're alright
We'll be alright
Love will tell us where to go
Then we're alright
We'll be alright
Love will tell us where to go

Take on the world
Let's go crazy
Love will tell us where to go
I'll be your girl, be my baby
Love will tell us where to go
Oh oh oh through a dark night
Oh oh oh without a sunrise
Oh oh oh and we will be alright
Love will tell us where to go
Love will tell us where to go
Love will tell us where to go
