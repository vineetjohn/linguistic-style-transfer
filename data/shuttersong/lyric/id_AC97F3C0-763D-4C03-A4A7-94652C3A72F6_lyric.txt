Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know...
It's been coming for some time...

When it's over so they say
It'll rain a sunny day
I know...
Shinin' down like water...

I wanna know...
Have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know...
Have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day?

Yesterday and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard
I know...
Been that way for all my time...

'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow
I know...
It can't stop, I wonder...

I wanna know...
Have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know...
Have you ever seen the rain...
Coming down on a sunny day?
I wanna know...
Have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know...
Have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day?
