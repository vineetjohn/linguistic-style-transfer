Is it getting better 
Or do you feel the same 
Will it make it easier on you now 
You got someone to blame
You say
One love
One life
When it's one need
In the night
One love
We get to share it
Leaves you baby if you
Don't care for it
Did I disappoint you 
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth 
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without
Well it's
Too late' Tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one' but we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other    One
Have you come here for forgiveness 
Have you come to raise the dead 
Have you come here to play Jesus 
To the lepers in your head
Did I ask too much 
More than a lot 
You gave me nothing
Now it's all I got
We're one but we're not the same
Well we hurt each other
Then we do it again
You say love is a temple
Love a higher law
Love is a temple
Love the higher law
You ask me to enter
But then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on
To what you got
When all you got is hurt
One love ' One blood
One life ' You got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters ' Brothers
One life ' But we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other
One
