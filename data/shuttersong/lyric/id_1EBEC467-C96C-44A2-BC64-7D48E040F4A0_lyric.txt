 Stealing hearts was your pastime
I saw girls falling hook line
You stole kisses and threw them aside
Hits and misses  your love side
You've changed for the better ye
You've changed for the better ye
Making waves  was  your hobby
And I asked you to hold me
And I knew it
You do it in front of the world
And I'll end up different from the other girls
You've changed for the better ye
You've changed for the better ye
You've changed for the better
You've changed for the better
You've changed for the better ye
You've changed for the better ye
You've changed for the better
You've changed for the better
