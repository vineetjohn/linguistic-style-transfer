To the night time she's burning
I wonder which way she was turning
And I still know the pain
She brought me live one day
She was always somewhere behind me
Thought that was something she was hiding
But now I found the truth
The thing she'll never use!

Liar, liar
She's on fire!
She's waiting there
Around the corner
Just a little air
And she'll jump on ya!

It's a quarter to midnight and she's leaving
Just when she thought I was sleeping
And I could not believe
The things that I had seen!
When it was the right time, I caught her
And she was there in the water
I found her with her trash
She heard me, answer back

Liar, liar
She's on fire!
She's waiting there
Around the corner
Just a little air
And she'll jump on ya!

Liar, liar oh oh oh
I need the sun to keep me dry
Liar, liar oh oh oh
The way you got me swimming through your lie
Liar, liar oh oh oh
Kept hearing voices in my mind, saying
Problem with the lies that she's in denial

Liar, liar
She's on fire!
She's waiting there
Around the corner
Just a little air
And she'll jump on ya!

Liar, liar
She's on fire!
She's waiting there
Around the corner
Just a little air
And she'll jump on ya!
