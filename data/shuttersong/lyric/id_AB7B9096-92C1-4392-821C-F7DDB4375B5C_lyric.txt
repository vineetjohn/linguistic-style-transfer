We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time

Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground

Smoke on the water
A fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out

He was pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
Swiss time was running out

It seemed that we would lose the race, now
Smoke on the water
A fire in the sky
Smoke on the water
(guitar solo)
Smoke on the water
A fire in the sky
Smoke on the water
