Chandelier - Sia
Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anything  when will I learn
I push it down  push it down
I'm the one "for a good time call"
Phone's blowin' up 
They're ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love  feel the love
1  2  3 1  2  3 drink
1  2  3 1  2  3 drink
1  2  3 1  2  3 drink
Throw em back 
Till I lose count
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier 
From the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night 
Feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier 
From the chandelier
And I'm holding on for dear life 
Won't look down won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light 
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Help me  I'm holding on for dear life 
Won't look down won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light 
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight
Sun is up  I'm a mess
Gotta get out now 
Gotta run from this
Here comes the shame 
Here comes the shame
1  2  3 1  2  3 drink
1  2  3 1  2  3 drink
1  2  3 1  2  3 drink
Throw em back
Till I lose count
I'm gonna swing
From the chandelier 
From the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow
Doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird
Through the night 
Feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier 
From the chandelier
And I'm holding on for dear life 
Won't look down won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full
Until morning light 
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Help me 
I'm holding on for dear life 
Won't look down won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full
Until morning light 
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight
On for tonight
I'm just holding on for tonight
I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight
On for tonight
I'm just holding on for tonight
I'm just holding on for tonight
I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight
On for tonight
