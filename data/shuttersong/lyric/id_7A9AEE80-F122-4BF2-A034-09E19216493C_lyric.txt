I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm.
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold.
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones.
It keeps my veins hot, the fire's found a home in me.
I move through town, I'm quiet like a fight
And my necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie it.

And now people talk to me, but nothing ever hits home.
People talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes.
I'm done with it (ooh)

This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my
heart
We're at the start, the colours disappear
I never watch the stars, there's so much down here

So I just try to keep up with the red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my
heart

I dream all year, but they're not the sweet kinds
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time
And now people talk to me, I'm slipping out of reach now
People talk to me, and all their faces blur
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison

And I'm locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me
I'm done with it (ooh)
This is the start of how it ever ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my
heart

We're at the start, the colours disappear
I never watch the stars, there's so much down here
So I just try to keep up with the red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my
heart
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat
