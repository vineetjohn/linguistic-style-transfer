Standing here in disarray
A calm serenity
The winds of change can devastate
And it took this much for me
With nowhere to run and no reason left to hide
Gonna hold on
All the walls around are broken down
Now I can hear the rising sun

Surrounded by everything I want
But nothing that I need
I was blinded by the absurdity
Losing all identity
Sometimes what you fear the most is what you need
To find that road
Right around that curve a lesson learned
Now that I have the eyes to see

A hurricane, a hurricane
Is sometimes the only way to wash away the pain
A hurricane, a hurricane
Is sometimes the only thing that brings you back again

With poison toys I'd isolate
But the wind was strong and true
But now I see where the treause is
'Cause they only blocked my view
I'm spiraling down but so oblivious
Got to find my way home
There's a heart that bleeds trapped in me
But how do I break this shell of stone

A hurricane, a hurricane
Is sometimes the only way to wash away the pain
A hurricane, a hurricane
Is sometimes the only thing that brings you back again

Sometimes I cried, the tears wouldn't fall
And sometimes I tried to break those walls
And feel your love
But I came alive
When I finally found my way

A hurricane, a hurricane
Is sometimes the only way to wash away the pain
A hurricane, a hurricane
Is sometimes the only thing that brings you back again
