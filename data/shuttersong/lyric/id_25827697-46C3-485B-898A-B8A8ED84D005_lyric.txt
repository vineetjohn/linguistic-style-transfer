Coldest water breaks over my soul
Let this heart just beat like your own

Because you're never far away
Even when you're far away, I promise

You're always on mind
It's like I'm with you all the time
You showed me what it is to feel love
And you took me far above the rest

No I'm never leaving, I don't have a reason
You keep believing in our love, we'll only keep it
You give me the strength to hold on
