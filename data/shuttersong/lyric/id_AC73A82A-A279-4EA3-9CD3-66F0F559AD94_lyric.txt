Volcano - The Vamps/Silentó
Give me a tear drop I'll give you an ocean
Give me a breath and I'll give you a storm
Give me a spark and I'll give you explosions
Love's just a mountain 'til it overflows
Volcano
Silento
I give you the multitude of everything you wish
Don't have to take a portion you can have the whole dish
Leave it up to me let me take all of the expense
Baby when I caught your heart I knew I didn't miss
Meet me on the field and I'll give you the whole yard
You came and lit my fire so our future will spark
There's something like a story now we write our own book
This volcano just see one thing got the whole world shook
Run deep like the ocean I'll drown in your love
You never have to wonder why I spend my whole life with you
Give me a tear drop I'll give you an ocean
Give me a breath and I'll give you a storm
Give me a spark and I'll give you explosions
Love's just a mountain 'til it overflows
