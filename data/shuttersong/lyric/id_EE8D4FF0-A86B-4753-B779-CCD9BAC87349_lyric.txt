You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't treat you quite as good as I should

Maybe I didn't love you quite as often as I could

Little things I should've said and done

I never took the time

You were always on my mind

You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you all those lonely lonely times

And I guess I never told you I'm so happy that you're mine

If I made you feel second best

I'm so sorry I was blind

You were always on my mind

You were always on my mind

Tell me tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied

Little things I should've said and done

I never took the time

You were always on my mind

You were always on my mind

You were always on my mind

You were always on my mind

You were always on my mind

You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't treat you

Maybe I didn't love you

Maybe I didn't hold you

I guess I never told you
