California
Then we fell into the shining sea
The weight that drags your heart down
Well  that¡¯s what took me
Where I need to be
Which is here  out on Zuma
Watching you cry like a baby
California  at the dawn
You thought would never come
But it did like it always does
All I know
And all I need to know
Is there is no  there is no end to love
I didn¡¯t call you
Words can scare a thought away
Everyone¡¯s a star in our town
It¡¯s just your light gets dimmer
If you have to stay
In your bedroom  in a mirror
Watching yourself cry like a baby
California  blood orange sunset
Brings you to your knees
I¡¯ve seen for myself
There¡¯s no end to grief
That¡¯s how I know
That¡¯s how I know
And why I need to know
That there is no
Yeah  there is no end to love
All I know and all I need to know
Is there is no
Yeah  there is no end to love
All I know and all I need to know
Is there is no love
There is no end to love
We come and go
But stolen days you don¡¯t give back
Stolen days are just enough
