We're never done with killing time.
Can I kill it with you...
Till the veins run red and blue?
We come around here all the time
Got a lot to not do.
Let me kill it with you.

You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again.
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrist over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here.
We might be hollow, but we're brave.

And I like you
I love these roads where the houses don't change
And I like you
Where we can talk like there's something to say
And I like you
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
And I like you
We move in between streets
I'd like it if you stayed

Now wear long sleeves, and the heating comes on.
You buy me orange juice.
We're getting good at this.
Dreams of clean teeth.
I can tell that you're tired
But you keep the car on
While you're waiting out front.

You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrist over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow, but we're brave

And I like you
I love these roads where the houses don't change
And I like you
Where we can talk like there's something to say
And I like you
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
And I like you
We move in between streets
I'd like it if you stayed

We're never done with killing time
Can I kill it with you?
Till our veins run red and... blue
We come around here all the time
Got a lot to not do, let me kill it with you

I love these roads where the houses don't change
