Your skin is warm like an oven,
your kiss is sugary sweet
Your fingers feel like cotton when you put your arms around me
I feel like I'm just missing something whenever you leave
You've got all the ingredients
except you loving me
And respectfully

I'm not a piece of cake for you to just discard
While you walk away with the frosting of my heart
So I'm taking back what's mine, you'll miss
The slice of heaven that I gave to you last night

You smell just like vanilla, you taste like buttercream
You're filling up my senses with empty calories
I feel like I'm just missing something whenever you leave
You've got all the ingredients except you needing me
So respectfully

I'm not a piece of cake for you to just discard
While you walk away with the frosting of my heart
So I'm taking back what's mine, you'll miss
The slice of heaven that I gave to you last night

If I am just a piece of cake
I am just a piece of cake (cake)
Then, you're just a piece of meat
You're just a piece of meat to me
If I am just a piece of cake
I am just a piece of cake (cake)
Then, you're just a piece of meat
You're just a piece of meat to me

I'm not a piece of cake for you to just discard
While you walk away with the frosting of my heart
So I'm taking back what's mine, you'll miss
The slice of heaven that I gave to you last night
The slice of heaven that I gave
The slice of heaven that I gave to you
The slice of heaven that I gave to you last night
