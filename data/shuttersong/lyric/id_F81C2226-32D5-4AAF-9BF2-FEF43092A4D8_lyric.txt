Everywhere is freaks and hairies
Dykes and fairies, tell me where is sanity
Tax the rich, feed the poor
'Til there are no rich no more

I'd love to change the world
But I don't know what to do

So I'll leave it up to you

Population keeps on breeding
Nation bleeding, still more feeding economy
Life is funny, skies are sunny
Bees make honey, who needs money, No none for me
I'd love to change the world
But I don't know what to do
So I'll leave it up to you
Oh yeah!
World pollution, there's no solution
Institution, electrocution
Just black and white, rich or poor
Senators stop the war
I'd love to change the world
But I don't know what to do
So I'll leave it up to you
