I lost the signal and put you away
Swore upon the sun I'd save you for a rainy day.
Loosen the noose and let go of the rope
I know if it's never coming back it has to go.

I keep calling your name, (keep calling your name)
I wanna hold you close but I never wanna feel ashamed.
So I keep calling at night, (keep calling at night)
I wanna hold you close, I just never wanna hold you tight.

Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling it off, calling it off just to keep crawling into your arms.
Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling it off, calling it off just to keep crawling into your arms.
I've found the weakness and put it to play
Swore upon the stars I'd keep you till the night was day.
Shake my head dizzy so I'll never know
You said if you're never coming back you have to go.

I keep calling your name, (keep calling your name)
I wanna hold you close but I never wanna feel ashamed.
So I keep calling at night, (keep calling at night)
I wanna hold you close, I just never wanna hold you tight.

Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling it off, calling it off just to keep crawling into your arms.
Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling it off, calling it off just to keep crawling into your arms.
Calling it off just to keep crawling into your arms

Calling it off just to keep crawling into your arms.

Oh my goodness, here I go again
Pulling you back to me, pulling you back into my arms so savagely.
I don't think I understand, 'cause I don't really know myself
I keep calling you up, calling you up.
Calling you up
Calling you up

Calling you up.
(So I call).
Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling it off, calling it off just to keep crawling into your arms.
Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling it off, calling it off just to keep crawling into your arms.
Calling it off just to keep crawling into your arms
Calling it off just to keep crawling into your arms.
