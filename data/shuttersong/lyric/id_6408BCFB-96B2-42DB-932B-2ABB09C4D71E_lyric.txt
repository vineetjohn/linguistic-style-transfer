Going out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kinda dress
Everything she never had, she's showing off

Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair

She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that you really want
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about you lately

Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes
Everything you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you
Chasing it tonight, doubts are running ‘round her head
He's waiting, hides behind his cigarette

Heart is beating loud, and she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast, moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet

Having no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about you lately
Does it ever drive you crazy

Just how fast the night changes
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you
Going out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kinda dress
Reminds her of a missing piece of innocence she lost

We're only getting older baby
And I've been thinking about you lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby
It will never change, baby
It will never change me and you
