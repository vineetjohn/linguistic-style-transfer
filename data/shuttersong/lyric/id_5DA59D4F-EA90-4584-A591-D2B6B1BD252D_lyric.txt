I Knew You Were Trouble. - Taylor Swift
Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights  you got me alone
You found me  you found me  you found me
I guess you didn't care  and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me  without me  without me
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down  oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh  oh  trouble  trouble  trouble
Oh  oh  trouble  trouble  trouble
No apologies  he'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning  you're drowning  you're drowning
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see  now I see  now I see
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me  hey 
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down  oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh  oh  trouble  trouble  trouble
Oh  oh  trouble  trouble  trouble
And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her 
Or anyone  or anything  yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down  oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh  oh  trouble  trouble  trouble
Oh  oh  trouble  trouble  trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble  trouble  trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble  trouble  trouble
