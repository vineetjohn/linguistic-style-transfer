It's perfect outside
It's like God let me die love the weather
I ain't seen some of them in forever
It's one of those never forget it,
better stop and take it in kinda scenes.
Everything's just right yeah except for one thing

You should be here,
standing with your arm around me here
Cutting up, cracking a cold beer, saying cheers
hey y'all it's sure been a good year
It's one of those moments,
that's got your name written all over it
And you know that if I had just one wish
it'd be that you didn't have to miss this
You should be here

You'd be taking way too many pictures on your phone
Showing them off to everybody that you know back home
And even some you don't yeah
They say now you're in a better place
And I would be too if I could see your face

You should be here,
standing with your arm around me here
Cutting up, cracking a cold beer, saying cheers,
hey y'all it's sure been a good year
It's one of those moments,
that's got your name written all over it
And you know that if I had just one wish it'd be that you didn't have to miss this.
Aw you should be here

You'd be loving this, you'd be freaking out, you'd be smiling, yeah
I know you'd be all about what's going on right here right now.
God I wish somehow you could be here
Oh you should be here

Yeah this is one of those moments that's got your name written all over it
And you know that if I have just one wish it'd be that you didn't have to miss this
Aw you should be here
You should be here
