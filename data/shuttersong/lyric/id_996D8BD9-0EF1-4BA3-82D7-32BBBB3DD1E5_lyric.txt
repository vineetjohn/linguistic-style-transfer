My lover's got humour

She's the giggle at a funeral

Knows everybody's disapproval

I should've worshipped her sooner

If the heavens ever did speak

She is the last true mouthpiece

Every Sunday¡¯s getting more bleak

The fresh poison each week

I was born sick, but I love it

Command me to be well

 

Amen

Amen

Amen

 

Take me to church

I'll worship like a dog

At the shrine of your lies

I'll tell you my sins

So you can sharpen your knife

Offer me that deathless death

Oh, good God, let me give you my life

 

Take me to church

I'll worship like a dog

At the shrine of your lies

I'll tell you my sins

So you can sharpen your knife

Offer me that deathless death

Oh, good God, let me give you my life

 

If I'm a pagan of the good times

My lover's the sunlight

To keep the goddess on my side

She demands a sacrifice

To drain the whole sea

Get something shiny

Something meaty for the main course

That's a fine looking high horse

What you got in the stable?

Got a lot of starving faithful

That looks tasty

That looks plenty

This is hungry work

 

Take me to church

I'll worship like a dog

At the shrine of your lies

I'll tell you my sins

So you can sharpen your knife

Offer me that deathless death

Oh, good God, let me give you my life

 

Take me to church

I'll worship like a dog

At the shrine of your lies

I'll tell you my sins

So you can sharpen your knife

Offer me that deathless death

Oh, good God, let me give you my life

 

No masters or kings

When the ritual begins

There is no sweeter innocence

Than our gentle sin

In the madness and soil

Of that sad earthly scene

Only then I am human

Only then I am clean

 

Take me to church

I'll worship like a dog

At the shrine of your lies

I'll tell you my sins

So you can sharpen your knife

Offer me that deathless death

Oh, good God, let me give you my life

 

Take me to church

I'll worship like a dog

At the shrine of your lies

I'll tell you my sins

So you can sharpen your knife

Offer me that deathless death

Oh, good God, let me give you my life

 

Take me to church
