 sometimes it hurts instead
 Sometimes  it lasts in love
But  sometimes  it  hurts  instead
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised
In a summer haze
Bound by the surprise
Of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight  it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me,  it isn't over
Never mind
I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best
For you too
Don't forget me I beg
I'll remember you said
 Sometimes  it lasts in love
But  sometimes  it  hurts  instead
Nothing compares
No worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes
They're memories made
Who would have known
How bitter sweet
This would taste
Never mind
I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best
For you
Don't forget me I beg
I'll remember you said
 Sometimes  it lasts in love
But  sometimes  it  hurts  instead
Never mind
I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best
For you too
Don't forget me I beg
I'll remember you said
 Sometimes  it lasts in love
But  sometimes  it  hurts  instead
 Sometimes  it lasts in love
But  sometimes  it  hurts  instead
