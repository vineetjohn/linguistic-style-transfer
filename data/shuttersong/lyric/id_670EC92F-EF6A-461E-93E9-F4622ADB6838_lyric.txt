Dream, beyond dreams
Beyond life you will find your song
Before sound, to be found close your eyes
Then rise, higher still, endless thrill
To the land of love beyond love
Come alive and you'll find
Forever watching you arrive

You are the night, you are the ocean
You are the light behind the cloud
You are the end and the beginning
A world with time is not allowed

There's no such thing as competition
To find a way we lose control
Remember love, the holy mission?
This is the journey of the soul

The perfect song is written with silence
It speaks of places never seen
Your home's a promise long forgotten
It is the birthplace of your dreams
