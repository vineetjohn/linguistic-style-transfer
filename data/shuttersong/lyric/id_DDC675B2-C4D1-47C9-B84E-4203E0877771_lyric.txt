
 

I know you've been goin' through some things, uh huh

I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?

I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty

 

The way you move it's like you could use a vacation

Drink in your hand and the harder you dance

I swear right now it look like you on a vacation

Gotta get away, make it happen

Whatever happened just had to happen

On vacation, yeah

I know you've been, I know you've been

 

Dancin', dancin', dancin' like you fucking got a reason

Dancing like it's something to believe in

Dancing like it's fuckin' dancing season

Blame it on the alcohol or blame it on sativa

The harder your heart keep beating

Only feel bad while you're thinkin'

Pop, pop, pop like Pepsi Co. the best we smoke

Plus the tan look like you flew in from Mexico

Go go, let me see how wild it get

Bust it wide as it get

You need to be taken care of and pampered

But just like a pamper, he on that childish shit

I know you've been silencing your phone

(Silencing your phone, ignoring calls from home)

I know you've been tryna get along

What's up, it's on, no games, we grown

I know you feel like sometimes that y'all don't speak the same language

I know that you just wanna let it go with all the bitches that you came with

 

I know you've been going through some thangs, wanna get away

Baby, let me be your vacation

That other trick you've been fuckin' with, is a trip

You know she be playin', baby I am just saying

I know you know I am down for whatever, yeah

You know I'm just here to make you feel better, yeah

Take a load off on my private island

Come inside and go into hiding

I know that you've been sacrificing your time

And need time to unwind and let go

So let go and let's go and let's roll and we roll

 

Excited, activated get ignited

So many charges on my card, oh God I think it got indicted

Get a, get a night, get a day, get a room, get a place

Get a drink, pop a bottle, maybe we can get away

You a star, you need space, we can shoot up by the town

Have you ever been to Texas? South By Southwest

Where we can smoke a zip like we can't get arrested

Where they might know us off any intersection

I mean baby I know you've been, wanna be that baddest

Wanna be with somebody who ain't never had it

No status, just all cinematics, you just got casted

 

I know you've been crying and poutin'

Know you're tired of arguing

But no screaming and shouting

And you know we on a roll like we did good in college

Throwin' hundreds and thousands

Like they not hundreds and thousands

Why? Cause I know you've been going through some things

(I know you've been going through some things you can't explain

With your main thing that shit insane I know you just tryna maintain, that shit is lame, you can't complain)

I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?

(Don't love the same, I know you've been diving through pain

I know goin' runnin' so crazy, I know you runnin' on empty

That shit can fuck with your mente

I know this shit, don't you tempt me, I know you...)

 

The way you move it's like you could use a vacation

Drink in your hand and the harder you dance

I swear right now it look like you on a vacation

Gotta get away, make it happen

Whatever happened just had to happen

On vacation, yeah

I know you've been, I know you've been

 

I know it look like like you need a vacation

How 'bout Hawaii, maybe Jamaica, maybe Asia

Take you places other niggas can't take ya

Don't forget the make up

Yeah
