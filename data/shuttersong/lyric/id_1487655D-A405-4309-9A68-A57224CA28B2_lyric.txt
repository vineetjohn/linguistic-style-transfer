This one goes out to you and yours
Worldwide
I say hey I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see
The less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I ve been a lot of places all around the way
I ve seen a lot joy and I ve seen a lot of pain
But I don t want to write a love song for the world
I just want to write a song about a boy and a girl
Junkies on the corner always calling my name
And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games
When I saw you getting down well I hoped it was you
And when I looked into your eyes I knew it was true
I say Hey I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see
The less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
Now I m not a highly metaphysical man
But I know when the stars are aligned you can
Bump into person in the middle of the road
Look into their eyes and you suddenly know
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
Dancing in the night in the middle of June
My momma told me don t lose you
Cause the best luck I had was you
I said Hey I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
And I said rocking in the dance hall moving with you
I said Hey momma hey momma close to you
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
I said hey papa hey papa close to you
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
I said Hey Momma close to you
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you I said
Hey momma hey momma hey momma hey momma
Hey momma hey momma hey momma hey momma
What you gonna do
My momma told me don t lose you
Cause the best luck I had was you
And I know one thing that I love you
I said hey I'll be gone today
But I ll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see the less I know
I said hey I'll be gone today
But I ll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see the less I know
But I know one thing that I love you
