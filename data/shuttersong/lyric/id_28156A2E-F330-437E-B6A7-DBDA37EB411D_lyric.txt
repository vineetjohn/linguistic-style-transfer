Can I call, wake you up on a Sunday?
Late night, I think we need a gateway
Headlights, hold tight, turn the radio loud (turn the radio loud)
Let me know where to go and I'll get you there
Tell the truth and I'll show you how to dare
Flashlights, held tight, we can own this town

Never say goodbye

So kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
And tell me that I'll see you again
Cause I don't know
If I can let you go
So kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
I'm dying just to see you again
Let's make tonight the best of our lives, yeah
Here's to teenage memories
Whoa oh oh oh ohhh

Close your eyes you'll be mine and it's alright
Take a breath, no rest 'til the sunrise
Heartbeat, so sweet when your lips touch mine
We don't have to go home right now
We're never gonna stop cause we're dreaming out loud
We know what we want, we know we're gonna get it somehow

Never say goodbye

So kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
And tell me that I'll see you again
Cause I don't know
If I can let you go
So kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
I'm dying just to see you again
