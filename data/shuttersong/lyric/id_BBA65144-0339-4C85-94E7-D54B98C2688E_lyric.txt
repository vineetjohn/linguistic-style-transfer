
I need you  that I need you
I need you  that I need you
I need you  you  you  you  you  you
I need you  that I need you
I need you  that I need you
I need you  you  you  you  you  you
You  you  you you
I need you the most
I gave you the key when the door wasn't open  just admit it
See  I gave you faith  turned your doubt into hoping  can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me he where are you now that I need you 
Where are you now 
Where are you now that I need you 
Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down I didn't leave you
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need you 
Where are you now that I need you 
Where are you now that I need you 
Where are you now that I need you 
Where are you now that I need you 
I gave you attention when nobody else was payin'
I gave you the shirt off my back  what you sayin'  to keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playin'  that's for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was prayin'  oh Lord
Where are you now that I need you 
Where are you now that I need you 
I need you  that I need you
I need you  that I need you
I need you  you  you  you  you  you
I need you  that I need you
I need you  that I need you
I need you  you  you  you  you  you
I need you the most
Where are you now that I need you 
Where are you now that I need you 
Where are you now that I need you 
I need you the most
I need you the most  I need you the most
