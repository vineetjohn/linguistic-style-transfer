It´s been so long since I have touched you
I can´t remember how it feels
To have your loving arms around me
This is the pain I´ve never healed

I'll be waiting
'till the sky falls down
let the rain clouds come
I'll be waiting
'till the sky falls down
'till you're coming around, baby

All my life I have been searching
For someone honest just like you
You left me here without a reason
Every tear belongs to you

I´ll be waiting
´till the sky falls down
´till you´re coming around, baby

I´ll be waiting
´till the sky falls down
let the rain clouds come

I´ll be waiting
´till the sky falls down
let the rain clouds come
