I could stay awake just to hear you breathing
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Where every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

Don't wanna close my eyes,
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you baby
and I don't wanna miss a thing

'Cause even when I dream of you
the sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you baby and I don't want to miss a thing
Lying close to you feeling your heart beating

And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
Wondering if it's me you're seeing
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
I just wanna stay with you in this moment forever,

forever and ever
I don't wanna close my eyes,
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you baby

and I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
the sweetest dream would never do

I'd still miss you baby and I don't want to miss a thing
I don't wanna miss one smile,
I don't wanna miss one kiss
I just wanna be with you, right here with you,
just like this
I just want to hold you close,
I feel your heart so close to mine
And just stay here in this moment
for all the rest of time
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah)
YEAAAHH
Don't wanna close my eyes,
don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you baby
and I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
the sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you baby and
I don't want to miss a thing
I don't wanna close my eyes,
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you baby
and I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
the sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you baby
and I don't want to miss a thing
Don't wanna close my eyes,
I don't wanna fall asleep
Yeah, I don't wanna miss a thing
