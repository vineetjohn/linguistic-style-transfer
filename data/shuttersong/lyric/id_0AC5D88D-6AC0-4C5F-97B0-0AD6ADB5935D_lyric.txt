You've been deep in a coma
But I stood right here
When you thought there was no one
I was still right here
You were scared, but I told ya
"Open up your eyes"
Never saw me as someone who could love you well
Had to show you the hard way
Only time will tell
Revelations and heartaches make you realize

I was always in front of you


So wake up
Your sleeping heart
I know sometimes we'll be afraid
But no more playing safe, my dear
I'm here
So wake up

Your sleeping heart
I know sometimes we'll be afraid
But no more playing safe, my dear
So wake up
Your sleeping heart
And we will dream a dream for us
That no one else can touch, my dear
I'm here
So wake up

So wake up
Your sleeping heart
And we will dream a dream for us
That no one else can touch, my dear
I'm here
