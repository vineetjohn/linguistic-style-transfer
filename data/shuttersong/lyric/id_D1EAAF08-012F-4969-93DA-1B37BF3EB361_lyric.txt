Think I just remembered something
I think I left the faucet running
Now my words are filling at the top

Darling you're just soaking in it
But I know you'll get out the minute
You notice all your fingers pruning up

I'm tired of being careful, gentle, trying to keep the water warm
Let me under your skin
Uh oh there it goes, I said too much, it overflowed
Why do I always spill?

I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap

I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap

Think I got myself in trouble
So I fill the bath with bubbles
Then I'll put the towels all away
Should've never said the word "love"
Threw a toaster in the bathtub
I'm sick of all the games I have to play

I'm tired of being careful, gentle, trying to keep the water warm
Let me under your skin
Uh oh, there it goes, I said too much, it overflowed
Why do I always spill?

I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap

I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap

I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap

I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap
