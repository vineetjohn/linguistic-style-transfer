Does he tell you he loves you when you least expect it
Does he flutter your heart when he kisses your neck
No scientist, or biology
It's obvious, when he's holding me
It's only natural that I'm so affected

And my heart won't beat again
If I can't feel him in my veins
No need to question, I already know
It's in his dna

D-d-d-dna

It's in his dna
And he just takes my breath away
B-b-breath away
I feel it every day, and that's what makes a man
Not hard to understand
Perfect in every way
I see it in his face
Nothing more to say
It's in his d-d-d-dna
It's the blue in his eyes that helps me see the future

Fingerprints that leave me covered for days, yeah yeah
Now I don't have any first degree

But I know, what he does to me
No need to work it out, it's so familiar
And my heart won't beat again
If I can't feel him in my veins

No need to question, I already know
It's in his dna
D-d-d-dna

It's in his dna
And he just takes my breath away
B-b-breath away
I feel it every day, and that's what makes a man

Not hard to understand
Perfect in every way
I see it in his face
Nothing more to say
It's in his d-d-d-dna
It's all about his kiss
Contaminates my lips

Our energy connects
It's simple genetic
I'm the x to his y
It's the colour of his eyes
He can do no wrong

No he don't need to try
Made from the best
He passes all the tests
Got my heart beating fast
It's cardiac arrest
He's from a different strain
That science can't explain
I guess that's how he's made
In his d-d-d-dna
It's in his dna
D-d-d-dna
It's in his dna
And he just takes my breath away
B-b-breath away
I feel it every day, and that's what makes a man
Not hard to understand
Perfect in every way
I see it in his face
Nothing more to say
It's in his d-d-d-dna
