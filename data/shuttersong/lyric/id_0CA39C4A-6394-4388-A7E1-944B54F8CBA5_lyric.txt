" I was on stage and I was thinking of...
I felt like I know him though I know his heart
And I know what he wouldn't do to hurt me
But I didn't realize that
Feeling so confident, feeling so great about myself...
And then it just be completely shattered by one thing
By something so stupid
But then you make me feel crazy baby
Feel like it's my fault
I was in pain..."

You got me sippin' on something
I can't compare to nothing
I've ever known I'm hoping
That after this fever, I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odd's against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you'd disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Hell over trip no more, so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I bet the odd's against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
This is a modern fairytale
No happy ending, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments breaking me down
Down, down, down
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I bet the odd's against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
