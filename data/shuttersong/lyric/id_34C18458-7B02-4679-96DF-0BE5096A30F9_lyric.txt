I wanna be a bottle blonde
I don't know why but I feel conned
I wanna be an idle teen
I wish I hadn't been so clean

I wanna stay inside all day
I want the world to go away
I want blood, guts, and chocolate cake
I wanna be a real fake

Yeah, I wish I'd been, I wish I'd been, a teen, teen idle
Wish I'd been a prom queen, fighting for the title
Instead of being sixteen and burning up a bible
Feeling super, super, super! Suicidal

The wasted years
The wasted youth
The pretty lies
The ugly truth

And the day has come where I have died
Only to find, I've come alive

I wanna be a virgin pure
A 21st century whore
I want back my virginity
So I can feel infinity

I wanna drink until I ache
I wanna make a big mistake
I want blood, guts, and angel cake
I'm gonna puke it anyway

Yeah, I wish I'd been, I wish I'd been, a teen, teen idle
Wish I'd been a prom queen, fighting for the title
Instead of being sixteen and burning up a bible
Feeling super, super, super! Suicidal

The wasted years
The wasted youth
The pretty lies
The ugly truth

And the day has come where I have died
Only to find, I've come alive
Come alive, I've come alive
Oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh oh

I wish I wasn't such a narcissist
I wish I didn't really kiss
The mirror when I'm on my own
Oh God, I'm gonna die alone

Adolescence didn't make sense
A little loss of innocence
The ugliness of being a fool
Ain't youth meant to be beautiful?
Yeah, I wish I'd been, I wish I'd been, a teen, teen idle
Wish I'd been a prom queen, fighting for the title
Instead of being sixteen and burning up a bible
Feeling super, super, super! Suicidal
The wasted years
The wasted youth
The pretty lies
The ugly truth
And the day has come where I have died
Only to find I've come alive
