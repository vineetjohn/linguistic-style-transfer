When my baby is a mess
My baby is a dancing queen
When my baby wears a dress
It's like she's not even a human being

Nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else has you down, but me
I behold the beauty

But the beauty got a hold on me
With all the other boys in the running
Never thought this could happen at 20
Nobody else

Nobody else
Nobody else has you down, but me
When my baby is a mess
My baby is a dancing queen

When my baby wears a dress
It's like she's not even a human being
Nobody else
Nobody else

Nobody else has you down
Has you down
Has you down, but me
Singing a ooooohhhh
I've been singing a ooooohhhhh
I've been singing a ooooohhhhh
