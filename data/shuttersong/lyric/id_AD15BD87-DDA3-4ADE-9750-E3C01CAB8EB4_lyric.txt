I guess I'll hang around a little while
While you here, no
I don't feel like being somewhere else
I guess I wouldn't mind to fall in love
A little bit, ouch
I think I fell a little more

Hanging on to nothing
I wouldn't change a thing
Stay where you are now

Oh no I've said too much
Got both feet in
My dear you fear too much
I'm just a little bit love ridden
I'm falling in to you

I'm just another tourist making stops
But it's clear, no
I'll never leave without you
Tell another story of love
And loss and fear, now
We have another night to kill

Hanging on to nothing
I'd do it all again
Stay where you are now

Oh no I've said too much
Got both feet in
My dear you fear too much
I'm just a little bit love ridden
I'm falling in to you

Crash through clouds and then we'll know
Don't look back I want you so
Love ridden
I'm falling in to
Love ridden
I'm falling in to you

Oh no I've said too much
Got both feet in
My dear you fear too much
Just keep breathing
Oh no I've said too much
Got both feet in
I hope it's not too much
I'm just a little bit love ridden
I'm falling in to you
