Woke up sweating from a dream
With a different kind of feeling
All day long my heart was beating
Searching for the meaning

Hazel eyes
I was so color blind
We were just wasting time
For my whole life
We never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind
But now I realize

It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now I know it was always you, always you

All my hidden desires
Finally came alive
No, I never told lies
To you so why would I
Start tonight

Hazel eyes
I was so color blind
We were just wasting time
For my whole life
We never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind
But now I realize

It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now I know it was always you, always you

(Aah, yeah, you, you, you, always you, you, you)

Woke up sweating from a dream
With a different kind of feeling

It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now I know it was always you, always you
It was always you
