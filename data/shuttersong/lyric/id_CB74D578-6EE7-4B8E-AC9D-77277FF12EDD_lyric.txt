Oh yeaah… Ah ah ah…
Is ah big dancehall song in know
Madzart alongside Kevin Lyttle
You know how it is, you know how we go
You know

For the longest while we jamming in the party
And you're wining on me
Pushing everything
Right back on top of me (yeah hey)
But if you think you're gonna get away from me
You better change your mind
You're going home
You're going home with me tonight

So let me hold you
Girl caress my body
You got me going crazy
You turn me on

Let me jam you
Girl wine all around me
You got me going crazy
You turn me on

One hand on the ground & bumper cock sky high
Wining hard on me

Hollerin' for mercy (yeah hey)

Then I whisper in her ear so wine harder
And then she sat on me
Boy just push that thing
Push it harder back on me
So let me hold you
Girl caress my body
