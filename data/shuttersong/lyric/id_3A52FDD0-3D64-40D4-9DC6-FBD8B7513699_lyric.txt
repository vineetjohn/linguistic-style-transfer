Even though the dancing's done
Don't worry 'cause the night is young
Who cares where we go
We're ready for the afterglow

Someone hold the sunlight back
'Cause we want this night to last

Smoke and lasers, love and ravers
Afterglow, we're ready for the afterglow
Lights and action, strong attraction
Afterglow, we're ready for the afterglow

Love and ravers
Strong attraction

Afterglow, we're ready for the afterglow
Afterglow, we're ready for the afterglow

We're ready for the afterglow!
We're ready for the afterglow!
We're ready for the afterglow!

Even though the dancing's done
Don't worry 'cause the night is young
Who cares where we go
We're ready for the afterglow

Someone hold the sunlight back
'Cause we want this night to last

Smoke and lasers, love and ravers
Afterglow, we're ready for the afterglow
Lights and action, strong attraction
Afterglow, we're ready for the afterglow

Love and ravers
Strong attraction

Oh, oh
Afterglow, we're ready for the afterglow
Oh, oh
Afterglow, we're ready for the afterglow
