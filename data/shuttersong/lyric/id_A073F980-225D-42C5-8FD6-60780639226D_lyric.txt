I hate that I remember
I wish I could forget
What you did last December
You left my heart a mess (a mess)
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it, oh, yeah, oh, yeah?

(It's the rascals)

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special, oh, yeah, yeah.

But last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Thought we belonged together
At least that's what you said
I should've known better
You broke my heart again (again)
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it, oh, yeah?

But last Christmas
I gave you my heart, gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (gave it away)
This year
To save me from tears (you got it)
I'll give it to someone special

But last Christmas (oh, baby)
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (gave it away)
This year (you got it)
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Ooh, yeah
How could you leave Christmas morning?
You broke my heart with no warning
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it, oh, yeah?

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart (gave you my heart)
But the very next day you gave it away (you gave it away)
This year
To save me from tears (oh, baby)
I'll give it to someone special

This is our last (last) last (last) Christmas.
You broke my heart
Last (last) last (last) Christmas
You broke my heart
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special.
