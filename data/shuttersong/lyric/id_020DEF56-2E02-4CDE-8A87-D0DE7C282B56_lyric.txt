.You got a boyfriend and he's a total loser
All your friends tell you that he's got no future.
But they like me
Just saying.
He barely takes you out and if he does he slay
And when the check comes he always makes you pay.
I'd never do that
Just saying.
You should leave him, 'cause it really makes me sick
Just saying
Just saying.
You don't need him, I'll help you get over it
Just saying
Just saying.
When you change your mind, I'll be waiting.
'Cause I'm better than him
Just saying.
When you change your mind, I'll be waiting.

Got a big house, he says he lives alone
But when I drove by I can see his mum was home.
I got my own place
Just saying.
He says he loves you, but it's all an act
He's seeing someone else, well, behind your back.
You know I'd never do that
Just saying.
You should leave him, 'cause it really makes me sick
Just saying

You don't need him, I'll help you get over it
