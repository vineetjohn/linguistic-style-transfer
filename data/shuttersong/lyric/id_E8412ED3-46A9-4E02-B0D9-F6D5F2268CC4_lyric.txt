Sugar
Hey  I've got a mouth full of cavities
Sweet tooth  full of mama  like sugar to me
So my love with the lips  put a bug in the ear tone
Shawty gotta kiss  it's an emergency
Spit sprung for the taste  addicted to her gloss
One smile this way  baby  I rub it off
Put my tongue in your face
A little mistletoe  sippin' Gran Marnier  I'm a fan all day
Do me that favor  'cause I like your flavor
My manage behavior; I'm into your major
Sweeter so flavor  that's good for this player
My hood  now and later  throw back like a pager
Pretty much  you're givin' me a sugar rush
Lil' mama  give me high blood pressure when you blush
Lips feel soft as a feather when we touch
Shawty  that's what's up
My lips like sugar  my lips like sugar
This candy got you sprung  this candy got you sprung
So call me your sugar  so call me your sugar
You love you some  you love you some
