If you want my love
You gotta do what it does
If you want these sweet like sugar Gucci lips
You gotta give it up
I know you think I'm cool
But I ain't one of the boys
No, don't be scared that I'm gon' tie you down
But, I need a little more

Baby, don't call me a friend
If I hear that word again
You might never get a chance to see me naked in your bed
And I know girls ain't hard to find
But if you think you wanna try
Then consider this an invitation to kiss my ass goodbye

Or gimme that title, title
Come and gimme that title, title
Better gimme that title, title
Come and gimme that title, title

If it ain't no thang
I won't be hanging around
But don't blow up my shit at 3 AM saying, "How you need me now"
Don't call me "boo"
Like you're some kind of ghost
If you don't want me seeing other guys
Well, here's what you need to know

Baby, don't call me a friend
If I hear that word again
You might never get a chance to see me naked in your bed
And I know girls ain't hard to find
But if you think you wanna try
Then consider this an invitation to kiss my ass goodbye

Or gimme that title, title
Come and gimme that title, title
Better gimme that title, title
Come and gimme that title, title

Yo... said I'm a special kinda woman
I'm loving what you got, but I'm hating what you doing, yup
Gotta understand that I'm looking for a man who can get up on that bike...
Look ma, no hands!
You gotta just show me off, off
What you embarrassed?
If that's the case I'm long gone
You gotta treat me like a trophy, put me on the shelf
Or call me something else

Baby, don't call me your friend
If I hear that word again
You might never get a chance to see me naked in your bed
And I know girls ain't hard to find
But if you think you wanna try
Then consider this an invitation to kiss my ass goodbye

Or gimme that title, title
Come and gimme that title, title
Better gimme that title, title
Come and gimme that title, title
