"Otherside"

[Chorus:]
How long how long will I slide
Separate my side I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat
It's all I ever

I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up it brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I've got to take it on the otherside

Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind
I've got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

[Chorus:]
How long how long will I slide
Separate my side I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat
It's all I ever

Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
She wants to know am I still a slut
I've got to take it on the otherside

Scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread
I've got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

[Chorus:]
How long how long will I slide
Separate my side I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat
It's all I ever

Turn me on take me for a hard ride
Burn me out leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that
It's not my friend
I tear it down I tear it down
And then it's born again

[Chorus:]
How long how long will I slide
Separate my side I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat
It's all I ever

How long I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat
It's all I ever
