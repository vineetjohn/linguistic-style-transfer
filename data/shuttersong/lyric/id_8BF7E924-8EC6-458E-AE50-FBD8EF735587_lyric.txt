Sweet sensation

I am a man with a heavy heart and I dare not turn the pages
Fighting with automatic self destruction, aye
It's a blind faith, a cruel waste, one bitter taste
So I know I need this sweet sensation, oh

Sweet sensation
The music that we play will ease your mind
Sweet sensation
The music that we play will ease your mind

What is a man now to do with his mind when it's working overtime?
The best I can do is now dance with the devil
I keep my soul sane, I won't waste this time and space
So I know I need this sweet sensation, oh

Sweet sensation
The music that we play will ease your mind
Sweet sensation
The music that we play will ease your mind

I am a man with a heavy heart
I am a man with a heavy heart
It's a blind faith, a cruel waste, one bitter taste
So I know I need this sweet sensation, oh

Sweet sensation
The music that we play will ease your mind
Sweet sensation
The music that we play will ease your mind
I am a man with a heavy heart
I am a man with a heavy heart
It's a blind faith, a cruel waste, one bitter taste
So I know I need this sweet sensation
