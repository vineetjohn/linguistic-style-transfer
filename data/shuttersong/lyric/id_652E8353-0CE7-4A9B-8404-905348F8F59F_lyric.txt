Hello, I know it's been a while
I wonder where you are, and if you think of me
Sometimes cause you're always on my mind
You know I had it rough, trying to forget you but
The more that I look around, the more I realize
You're all i'm looking for

What makes you so beautiful
is you don't know how beautiful you are to me
You're not trying to be perfect
Nobody's perfect, but you are, to me
It's how you take my breath away
Fill the words that I don't say
I wish somehow, I could say them now
Oh, oh, I could say them now, yeah

Just friends, the beginning of the end
How do we make sense
When we're on our own
It's like you're the other half of me
I feel incomplete, I should've known
Nothing in the world compares to the feelings that we share
It's so not fair

What makes you so beautiful
is you don't know how beautiful you are to me
You're not trying to be perfect
Nobody's perfect, but you are, to me
It's how you take my breath away
Fill the words that I don't say
I wish somehow, I could say them now

Oh, it's not you, blame it all on me
I was running from myself
Cause I couldn't tell how deep that we
We were gonna be
I was scared it's destiny, but it hurts like hell
Hope it's not too late, just a twist of fate
