When you first left me I was wanting more
But you were fucking that girl next door
What you do that for?
When you first left me I didn't know what to say
I've never been on my own that way, just sat by myself all day

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found a light in the tunnel at the end
Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
And it's only because you're feeling alone

At first, when I see you cry
Yeah, it makes me smile, yeah it makes me smile
At worst I feel bad for a while
But then I just smile
I go ahead and smile

Whenever you see me you say that you want me back
And I tell you it don't mean jack, no it don't mean jack
I couldn't stop laughing, no I just couldn´t help myself
See you messed up my mental health I was quite unwell

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found a light in the tunnel at the end
Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
And it's only because you're feeling alone

At first, when I see you cry
Yeah, it makes me smile, yeah, it makes me smile
At worst I feel bad for a while
But then I just smile
I go ahead and smile
At first when I see you cry
Yeah it makes me smile, yeah it makes me smile
At worst I feel bad for a while
But then I just smile
I go ahead and smile
At first when I see you cry
Yeah it makes me smile, yeah it makes me smile
At worst I feel bad for a while
But then I just smile
I go ahead and smile
