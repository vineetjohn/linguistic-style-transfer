Can I have, can I have, can I have this dance
Can I have, can I have, can I have this dance
Lights flashing, we're dressed up and my song's on the stereo
All night dancing, staying up, ain't no better place to go
Moving the crowd, nothing to sound so loud like a modern day Van Gogh
Where we're crashing, end up
Yeah, no one may every know
I see you, and though we never met before
Well I can some how feel
That you're the one I want for sure
It's all new but it's you that I adore
Baby this could all turn into something more
Date nights, Could turn into late nights
Something that would nothing between you and me girl
Hot lights could turn into spot lights
So I make a move before I lose my chance
Could I have this dance (can I have this dance)
Look here babe, listen up cause I need you to understand(talk to me girl)
That this can't work if you don't take my hand, ya
I need you and it's something I believe
'Cause baby I don't ever want to leave
Date nights could turn into late nights
Something that would nothing between you and me girl
Hot lights could turn into spot light
So I make a move before I lose my chance
Can I have this dance
Can I have, can I have, can I have this dance
Can I have, can I have, can I have this dance
Oh oh, please don't leave my side
Oh oh, it's you I want tonight
Oh oh, and it feels so right
Yeah, it's right
Date nights could turn into late nights
Something that would nothing between you and me girl
Ohhh
Hot lights could turn into spot lights
So I make a move before I loose my chance
Can I have, can I have, can I have this dance
Can I have, can I have, can I have this dance
Can I have, can I have, can I have this dance
Can I have, can I have, can I have this dance
