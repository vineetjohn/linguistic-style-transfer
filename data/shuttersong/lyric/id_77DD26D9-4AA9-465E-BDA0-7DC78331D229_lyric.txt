Sweat drips in my eyes
Screams of lust we cry
Tonight, you are, everything
You are everything...
You are everything to me

No more as I wake
From this perfect dream...
I'll escape from Eden's walls
Can I not stay and live this lie?
For I must think only of myself

And to think that you will not be scared
Or surprised I severed all these ties
This is the end

I'll lose myself in anguish for tonight
Help me get over you

I feel so numb to see this bitter end...
(It has come to this...) End of beautiful illusions
(Broken pieces) Will not mend
(... One last kiss) To save our past now

This is the end

I'll lose myself in anguish for tonight
Help me get over you
One last false apology
Help me get over you

Now we must let go...

Urgency overwhelms me as I must restrain my flood of tears

I refuse to be slave to your false beauty again
I'll lose myself in anguish for tonight
Help me get over you
One last false apology
Help me get over you
In my mind blood drips from your eyes
A beautiful last goodbye
