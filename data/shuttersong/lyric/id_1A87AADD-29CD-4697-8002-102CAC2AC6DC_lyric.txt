War is overdue

The time has come for you
To shoot your leaders down
Join forces underground

Lose control
And increasing pace
Warped and bewitched
Time to erase
Whatever they say
These people are torn
Wild and bereft
Assassin is born, yeah

Aim, shoot, kill your leaders

They'll try to steal your life
So watch your back
You're not alone
But you must actualise
The first attack

Oppose and disagree
Destroy demonocracy

Lose control
And increasing pace
Warped and bewitched
Time to erase
Whatever they say
These people are torn
Wild and bereft
Assassin is born, yeah
