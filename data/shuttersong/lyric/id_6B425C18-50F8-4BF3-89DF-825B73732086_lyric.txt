I was almost about to lose my faith
Was still dreaming but feared it was too late

But then you came along to my surprise
And stole my heart before my very eyes

You took me right out of the blue
Simply by showing that you love me too
Only by giving me your everything
With a love so true you took me out of the blue

I was wondering what love was all about
I was trying but couldn't work it out

But then you came along to my surprise
And made my frozen mind come alive

You took me right out of the blue
Simply by showing that you love me too
Only by giving me your everything
With a love so true you took me out of the blue

You let me out of the darkness
You brought me out in the sun
I think you must be the only one for me
'cos you took me

Right out of the blue
Simply by showing that you love me too
Only by giving me your everything
Breathing air below my wings
You took me right out of the night
Simply by filling my heart with light
Only by giving me your energy
With a love so true you took me out of the blue
