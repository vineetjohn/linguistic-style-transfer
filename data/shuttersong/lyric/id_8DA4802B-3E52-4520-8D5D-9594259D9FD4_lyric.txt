Seems like everybody here is speakin' different languages
With that green prescription file
Blowin' up their faces

And they all look me up and down like I'm the fucking new kid
But I saw the sun rise on this town way before you did
And they're all skiing in the powder room
Making love to Jack and Jameson
But I'll stick with hell no's and headphones

Cause all of my friends are leaving soon
To find them, themselves another round
But I'll be here in this stranger's room
Just for now (just for now)
Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones

27 blocks ago
I didn't even say goodbye
People blowin' up my phone
Askin' me if I'm alright

And they're sending pictures, kissing on each other, like wasted
And on top on that, they're sending videos of them naked
I don't judge what's on your tongue
Yeah, I know you're having fun
But I'll stick with hell no's and headphones

Cause all of my friends are leaving soon
To find them, themselves another round
But I'll be here in this stranger's room
Just for now (just for now)
Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones
Don't want another drink
I just, just wanna be alone
No, I don't care 'bout what you think
I'm going home
Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones
Ha la la Ha la la
Hell no's and headphones
Ha la la Ha la la
Hell no's and headphones
Ha la la
Hell no's and headphones
Hell no's and headphones
