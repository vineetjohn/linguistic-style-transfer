Jingle Bell Rock - Sabrina
Jingle bell  jingle bell  jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell  jingle bell  jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air 
What a bright time  it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse  pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell rock
Jingle bell  jingle bell  jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air 
What a bright time  it's the right time
To rock the night away (Rock the night away)
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse  pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell around
What a bright time  it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse  pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell 
That's the jingle bell 
That's the jingle bell rock
