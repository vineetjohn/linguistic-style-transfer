I'll wait until you have to go,
I'll make it so you never ever know
How much I have messed it up!
We're running 'round like we don't care,
It's gonna leave its marks somewhere,
Do you want to show me something new?
(You go now, reached my top anyway)
(You go now, reached my top anyway)
Just tell me what I have to do,
To keep myself apart from you
All your colors start to burn
I know I wanted far too much,
Then I thought that wouldn't be enough
All this talk is closing you.
Take shelter,
Take the pressure,
Do what you want tonight, it's alright,
If you want to get used,
Then get used!
Take shelter,
Take the pressure,
Do what you want tonight, it's alright,
If you want to get used,
Then get used!
I don't really wanna stop myself
Nobody's gonna tell me I need help,
Are you coming over soon?
I need you at the darkest time
You hold me, and I have to shut my eyes
I'm shy, cannot be what you like.
(You go down, reached my top anyway)
(You go down, reached my top anyway)
Just tell me what I have to do,
To keep myself apart from you
All your colors start to burn.
And take shelter,
Take the pressure,
Do what you want tonight, it's alright,
If you want to get used,
Then get used!
Take shelter,
Take the pressure,
Do what you want tonight, it's alright,
If you want to get used,
Then get used!
I don't really need this pressure to go
If you wanna find love,
If you wanna find something more
I'll be the one to run for you.
I don't really need this pressure to go
If you wanna find love,
If you wanna fins something more
I'll be the one to run for you!
Take shelter,
Take the pressure,
Do what you want tonight, it's alright,
If you want to get used,
Then get used!
Take shelter,
Take the pressure,
Do what you want tonight, it's alright
If you want to get used!
