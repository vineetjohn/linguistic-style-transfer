I don't think they know the truth
Say they saw (A-A-to the L-I-Y-A-H)
I don't think they know, how could they know
I don't think they know the truth
Say they saw
I don't think they know, how could they know

Don't let them tell you any different
They don't know about us, they don't know about it
I owe it all to you
They don't know about us, they don't know about it
And as much as I messed up, always give me your best love
They don't know about us, they don't know about it

Sometimes I wonder what I did to deserve you
They don't know about us, they don't know about it
They gon' talk about it (gon' talk about it)
Gon' try to change your mind about it
Gon' tell you things you don't wanna hear
Cause we good. (Don't worry 'bout it)
So when they talk about (they talk about it)
Just let ‘em know we already got it
Just tell ‘em that we gon' work at it, we good (Don't worry 'bout it)

I don't think they know the truth
Say they saw
I don't think they know, how could they know
I don't think they know the truth
Say they saw
I don't think they know, how could they know

Don't listen to (How could they know)
What people say (How could they know)
They don't know about (How could they know)
‘Bout you and me (How could they know)

At my best you love me
They don't know about us, they don't know about it
Even though I act my worse
They don't know about us, they don't know about it
And I know that it's different, feels like we're best friends
We connected
They don't know about us, they don't know about it

What did I do to deserve you
They don't know about us, they don't know about it
They gon' talk about it (gon' talk about it)
Gon' try to change your mind about it
Gon' tell you things you don't wanna hear
Cause we good. (Don't worry 'bout it)
So when they talk about (they talk about it)
Just let ‘em know we already got it
Just tell ‘em that we gon' work at it, we good (Don't worry 'bout it)

I don't think they know the truth
Say they saw
I don't think they know, how could they know
I don't think they know the truth
Say they saw
I don't think they know, how could they know

Don't listen to (How could they know)
What people say (How could they know)
They don't know about (How could they know)
‘Bout you and me (How could they know)

How could they know
How could they know
How could they know
How could they know
How could they know
Thank you for the autographs
And the tears over the years
You still found me, you didn't doubt me
I think you want some more
I do more than sing
I'm older now
Actin' now
Cause I got my own movie now
After all the awards
That they gave me
You still found me

You didn't play me, you didn't doubt me
Think you want some more
I truly believe that if it wasn't all for you
I don't know what I would do
I don't think they know the truth
Say they saw
I don't think they know, how could they know
I don't think they know the truth
Say they saw
I don't think they know, how could they know
Don't listen to (How could they know)
What people say (How could they know)
They don't know about (How could they know)
‘Bout you and me (How could they know)
