 cool kids
'Cause all the  cool  kids
They seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the  cool  kids
Like the  cool  kids
He says I'm talking with a big smile
But they haven't got a clue
Yeah, they're living the good life
Can't see what he is going through
They're driving fast cars
But they don't know where they're going
In the fast lane
Living life without knowing
And he says
I wish that I could be like the  cool  kids
'Cause all the  cool  kids
They seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the  cool  kids
Like the  cool  kids
I wish that I could be like the  cool  kids
'Cause all the  cool  kids
They seem to get it
I wish that I could be like the  cool  kids
Like the  cool  kids
And they said
I wish that I could be like the  cool  kids
'Cause all the  cool  kids
They seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the  cool  kids
Like the  cool  kids
I wish that I could be like the  cool  kids
'Cause all the  cool  kids
They seem to get it
I wish that I could be like the  cool  kids
Like the  cool  kids
I wish that I could be like the  cool  kids
'Cause all the  cool  kids
They seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the  cool  kids
Like the  cool  kids
