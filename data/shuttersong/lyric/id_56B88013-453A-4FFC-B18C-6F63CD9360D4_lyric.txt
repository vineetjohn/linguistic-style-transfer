Give me the dust of my fathers
Stand on the face of the ancients
Bare the secret flesh of time itself

Follow me
I've come so far, I'm behind again
Follow me
I wish so hard, I'm there again
Follow me

All that I wanted were things I had before
All that I needed, I never needed more
All of my questions are answers to my sins
And all of my endings are waiting to begin

I know the way, but I falter
I can't be afraid of my patience
There's a sacred place Razel keeps safe

Follow me
I've seen so much I'm blind again
Follow me
I feel so bad I'm alive again
Follow me
All that I wanted were things I had before
All that I needed, I never needed mores
All of my questions are answers to my sins
And all of my endings are waiting to begin
