White white tiger
I ride roller coaster
If I am still caught up on
These safety bars
I thought we made it
Don't count for
White white

As hot wind hits my skin
I begin to take a breath
And all adrenaline rushes through my head
And I'm not in my comfort zone
Wanna back out but not alone, right now
Oh my head is in the clouds your my

White white tiger
I ride roller coaster
If I am still caught up on
These safety bars
I thought we made it
Don't count for
White white

Water damn makes a stand drunk wavestake control
I was drowning, but you're keeping me afloat
You're my
White white
And I'm not in my comfort zone
Wanna back out but not alone, right now
Oh my head is in the clouds your my

White white tiger
I ride rollercoaster
If I am still caught up on
These safety bars
I thought we made it
Don't count for

Highland no dry land will take me there
oh off with my head this cliff edge will take me there you're my white

You know you're my
White Tiger
