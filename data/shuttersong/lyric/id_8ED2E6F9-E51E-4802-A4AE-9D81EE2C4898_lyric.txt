salsa cantik Yeah, J-J-J-JB
Yeah, woah, woah, no, no

Now I can see it, girl
You ain't gotta say nothing
Your lips are calling me
Like they wanna do something

I feel the chemistry
Yeah, you're givin' me
A little kiss is a definite possibility

Seen you a couple times
Had a couple conversations
Since you been on my mind
Made a couple observations

Like you a fly chick, you could be my chick
Play by the rules and you can get what I give

Just keep it quiet, keep it on the hush
And what we do, keep it just between us
I don't wanna see you tweet about JB
'Cause the only people that should know is you and me

So baby, I know that you're cool with rocking with me
But I can't have you telling everybody
Got me all twisted with your lips like this

So tell me, tell me are you gonna kiss, kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss, kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss me, then tell everybody
Cause you got me twisted with your lips, girl
Are you gonna kiss and tell?

It's confidential
No one has to do with it
But you and me, girl
Tell and we'll ruin it

Don't need that T.M.Z.
All in our privacy
Use them lips for kissing, girl
If you wanna ride with me

And if you wanna tell somebody
Then we can call the whole thing off, no problem
You can go your way and I'll go mine
But I'd rather spend a little time with you, yeah

Just keep it quiet, keep it on the hush
And what we do, keep it just between us
I don't wanna see you tweet about JB
'Cause the only people that should know is you and me

So baby, I know that you're cool with rocking with me
But I can't have you telling everybody
Got me all twisted with your lips like this

So tell me, tell me, are you gonna kiss, kiss and tell?
Tell me, are you gonna kiss, kiss and tell?

Kiss and tell, oh

Don't tell your homies
Don't tell your mama
Don't tell your girlfriends
