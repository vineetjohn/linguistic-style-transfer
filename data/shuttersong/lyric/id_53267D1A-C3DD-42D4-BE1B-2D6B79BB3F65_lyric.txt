I was there to witness
Candice's inner business
She wants the boys to notice
Her rainbows, and her ponies
She was educated but could not count to ten
Now she got lots of different horses
By lots of different men
And I say

Liberate your sons and daughters
The bush is high but in the hole is water
You can get some, when they give it
Nothing sacred, but it's a living

Hey, ho, here she goes
Either a little too high or a little too low
Low self-esteem and vertigo
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy
Hey, ho, here she goes
Either a little too loud or a little too close
Got a hurricane at the back of her throat
She thinks she's made of candy

Ring a ring of roses
Whoever gets the closest
She comes and she goes
As the war of the roses
Mother was a victim
Father beat the system
By moving bricks to Brixton
And learning how to fix them

Liberate your sons and daughters
The bush is high but in the hole there's water
As you will she'll be the whole of the law
And if it don't feel good
What are you doing it for
Now tell me

Hey, ho, here she goes
Either a little too high or a little too low
Low self-esteem and vertigo
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy
Hey, ho, here she goes
Either a little too loud or a little too close
Got a hurricane in the back of her throat
She thinks she's made of candy

Liberate your sons and daughters
The bush is high but in the hole there's water
As you will she'll be the whole of the law
And if you don't feel good
What are you doing it for?
What are you doing it for?
What are you doing it for?
What are you doing it for?
What are you doing it for?
What are you doing it for?
What are you doing it for?
What are you doing it for?
What are you doing it for?

Hey, ho, here she goes
Either a little too high or a little too low
Low self-esteem and vertigo
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy
Hey, ho, here she goes
Either a little too loud or a little too close
Got a hurricane in the back of her throat
She thinks she's made of candy

Hey, ho, here she goes
Either a little too high or a little too low
Low self-esteem and vertigo
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy
Hey, ho, here she goes
Either a little too loud or a little too close
Got a hurricane in the back of her throat
She thinks she's made of candy
