Hey, yo, Jason
Say somethin' to her
Holla at her

I got one question
How do you fit all that... in them jeans?

You know what to do with that big fat butt

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Just a little bit of... swing

Patty cake, Patty cake
With no hands
Got me in this club making wedding plans
If I take pictures while you do your dance
I can make you famous on Instagram

Hot damn it
Your booty like two planets
Go head, and go ham sandwich
Whoa, I can't stand it

'Cause you know what to do with that big fat butt

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Just a little bit of... swing

Cadillac, Cadillac, pop that trunk
Let's take a shot
Alley oop that dunk
Tired of working that 9 to 5
Oh baby let me come and change your life

Hot damn it
Your booty like two planets
Go head, and go ham sandwich
Whoa, I can't stand it

'Cause you know what to do with that big fat butt

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
(Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle)
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
(Shake it, shake it girl)
Just a little bit of
(Little bit of, little bit of, little bit of swing!)

Shake what your mama gave you
Misbehave you
I just wanna strip you, dip you, flip you, bubble bathe you
What they do
Taste my rain drops, K boo
Now what you will and what you want and what you may do
Completely separated,
Till I deeply penetrate it
Then I take it out and wipe it off
Eat it, ate it, love it, hate it
Overstated, underrated, everywhere I've been
Can you wiggle, wiggle for the D, O, double G, again?

Come on baby
Turn around (turn around, turn around, turn around)
You're rock star girl
Take a bow (take a bow, take a bow, take a bow)
It's just one thing that's killing me
How'd you get that in them jeans?

You know what to do with that big fat butt

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
(Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle)
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
(Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle)
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
(Shake it, shake it girl)
Just a little bit of
(Little bit of, wiggle wiggle)
Wiggle, wiggle

Now make it clap
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Now make it clap
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Make it clap
(Baby when you do it like that)
Just a little bit of
Now make it clap
No hands baby, make it clap, clap, clap
(Like swing)

Damn, baby, you got a bright future behind you
