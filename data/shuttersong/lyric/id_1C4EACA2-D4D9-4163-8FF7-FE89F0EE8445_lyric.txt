You're all alone
And I did this
I've got
No one else to blame
You didn't know
I was a risk
And it's such
A crying shame
How you gave me
All of you
And wanted
Nothing else from me
But to make
Some time for you
But all I made you
Was lonely

I couldn't see
But I know
That I acted
Selfishly
I shoulda known
That I let you down
Caused you
So much misery
Forever to bleed I shoulda been there All of the times
You used to cry
Because
I would let you down
I'm losing time
I shoulda tried
A little more
To be around
But I didn't know
That you were hurting
I was just to blind
Only thing
I know for certain
Another you
I'll never find

I couldn't see
But I know
That I acted selfishly
I shoulda known
That I let you down
Caused you
So much misery
Forever to bleed I shoulda been there I'm through
With regret
I'm gonna tip
And soak myself
In misery
Now in yo life
I'll take more time
No more yearning
Without me
But it hurts
To think of you
All by yo self
But now I see
And I apologize
Ffor all the times
I left you home
Waiting for me

I couldn't see
But I know
That I acted
Selfishly
I shoulda known
That I let you down
Caused you
So much misery
Forever to bleed I'm gonna be there
(I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there
(I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there
(I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there

Uh, oh, uh, oh
Uh, oh, uh
Ohhhhhhhh
