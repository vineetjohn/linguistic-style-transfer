I'll tell the world, I'll sing a song
It's a better place since you came along
Since you came along

Your touch is sunlight through the trees
Your kisses are the ocean breeze
Everything's allright when you're with me

And aaa... You're my favorite thing
Aaaa. All the love that you've bring
Well it feels like I've open my eyes again
And the colors are golden and bright again
There's a song in my heart, I feel like I belong
It's a better place since you came along
It's a better place since you came along

I see the whole world in your eyes
It's like I've known you all my life
It's just feels so right

So I pour my heart into your hands
It's like you really understand
You love the way I am

And aaaa... You're my favorite thing
Aaaa... All the happiness you bring
Well it feels like I've opened my eyes again
And the colors are golden and bright again
And the sun paints the skies and the wind sings her song
It's a better place since you came along
It's a better place since you came along

Oooo, huuuu, aaaaa, uuuu

Now I'm alright, now I'm alright, everything's alright
Cause it feels like I've open my eyes again
And the colors are golden and bright again
There's a song in my heart, I feel like I belong
It's a better place since you came along
It's a better place since you came along
