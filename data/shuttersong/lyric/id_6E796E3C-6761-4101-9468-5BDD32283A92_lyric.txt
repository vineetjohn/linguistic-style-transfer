She was all I ever wanted
She was all I ever needed and more
She walked out my door
Then she went away
Left my heart in two
Left me standing here
Singing all these blues, woo

You left without a single word
Not even sorry
It might hurt worse to hear you say
I'm leaving, goodbye
But your smile still makes my heart sing
Another sad song
I can't forget it
Won't regret it
Cause I'm still in love with you

We had fun under the sun
And when winter came she'd be my angel
We were so in love
Then she went away
Left my heart in two
Left me standing here
Singing all these blues, yeah yeah

You left without a single word
Not even sorry
It might hurt worse to hear you say
I'm leaving, goodbye
But your smile still makes my heart sing
Another sad song
I can't forget it
Won't regret it
Cause I'm still in love with you
Still in love with you

I don't know what hurts worse baby
Seeing you with him
Or being alone
On my own
I know he doesn't love you baby
Not like I did
Oh what's the point

You're not listening anyway
You left without a single word
Not even sorry
It might hurt worse to hear you say
I'm leaving, goodbye
But your smile still makes my heart sing
Another sad song
I can't forget it
Won't regret it

Cause I'm still in love with you
You left without a single word
Not even sorry
It might hurt worse to hear you say
I'm leaving, goodbye
But your smile still makes my heart sing
Another sad song
I can't forget it
Won't regret it
Cause I'm still in love with you
