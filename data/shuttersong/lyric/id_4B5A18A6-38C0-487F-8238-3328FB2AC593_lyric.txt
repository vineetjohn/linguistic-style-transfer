We gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars

How many people you know can take it this far?
I'm supercharged
I'm 'bout to take this whole thing to Mars
Now we gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars

You don't know what we been through to make it this far
So many scars
‘Bout to take this whole thing to Mars
(Lift off)

Lift off, takin' my coat off
Showin' my tattoos, I'm such a showoff (Huh?)
I feel the pain and then rolled off
I got the whole city, they about to go off
How many niggas wit' me up in this bitch?
How many people wanna roll with me now?
Like you know na na na, you know me by now
Know me, know me by now
We gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars
