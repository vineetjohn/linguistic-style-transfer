I shoulda saw it comin'
I shoulda saw the signs
But I wanted to believe you, trust you
You said you wouldn't lie
But baby you were so good, so good
You had me goin' blind
You said it was your best friend, I'm guessing
I wasn't your type, hey

What goes around comes around
And if it goes up, it comes down
I know you're mad 'cause I found out
Want you to feel what I feel right now

Now that it's over
I just wanna break your heart right back
Right back
Want you to cry me a river
I just wanna break your heart right back
Hey
All this time, I was blind running round telling everybody

My baby loves me

You said I was your best, would be your last
Now he's gone, you're alone
Don't want you back

You're tellin' me you're sorry
Well sorry, I'm over it
'Cause I've already been there done that
Ain't doing this again
No

What goes around comes around
And if it goes up, it comes down
I know you're mad 'cause I found out
Want you to feel what I feel right now
Now that it's over
I just wanna break your heart right back
Right back
Want you to cry me a river
I just wanna break your heart right back

Sorry had to tell you I'm a nice guy

But I don't know why, uh
