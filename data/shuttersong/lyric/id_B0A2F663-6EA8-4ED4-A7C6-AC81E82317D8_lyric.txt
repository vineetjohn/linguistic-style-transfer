My love, do you ever dream of
Candy coated raindrops?
You're the same, my candy rain

Have you ever loved someone
So much you thought you'd die?
Giving so much of yourself
It seems the only way

Tell me what you want and I
And I will give it to you
'Cause you are

My love, do you ever dream of
Candy coated raindrops?
You're the same, my candy rain

My love, did you ever dream
That it could be so right?
I never thought that I would find
All that I need in life

All I want, all I need now, now I know
I know I found it in you, I found it in you
'Cause you are

My love, do you ever dream of
Candy coated raindrops?
You're the same, my candy rain
My love, do you ever dream of
Candy coated raindrops?
You're the same, my candy rain
My love, do you ever dream of
Candy coated raindrops?
You're the same, my candy rain
Candy coated raindrops
Candy coated raindrops
My love, do you ever dream of
Candy coated raindrops?
You're the same, my candy rain
My love, do you ever dream of
Candy coated raindrops?
You're the same, my candy rain
