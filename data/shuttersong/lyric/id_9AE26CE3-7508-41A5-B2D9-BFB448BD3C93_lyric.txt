Make a little conversation
So long I've been waiting
To let go of myself and feel alive
So many nights I thought it over
Told myself I kind of liked her

But there was something missing in her eyes
I was stumbling, looking in the dark
With an empty heart
But you say you feel the same
Could we ever be enough?

Baby we could be enough
And it's alright
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight
When you're lost, I'll find a way
I'll be your light

You'll never feel like you're alone
I'll make this feel like home
So hard that I couldn't take it
Want to wake up and see your face
And remember how good it was being here last night
Still high with a little feeling

I see the smile as it starts to creep in
It was there, I saw it in your eyes
I was stumbling, looking in the dark
With an empty heart
But you say you feel the same

Could we ever be enough?
Baby we could be enough
And it's alright
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight
When you're lost, I'll find a way

I'll be your light
You'll never feel like you're alone

I'll make this feel like home
I'll make this feel like home
Baby we could be enough
It's alright
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight
When you're lost, I'll find a way
I'll be your light
You'll never feel like you're alone
I'll make this feel like home
