I never thought I'd fall so far down
This incredibly long dark hole
Something so sweet as the sound of your feet
On the floor would give me more room to breath

I'll say goodbye again tonight
The third time's the charmer they say
Your words are inked on my skin
The marks of incredible love

Incredible love, you fill me
Incredible love, you spill me
Incredible love, you kill me
Incredible love

Everything says it's time to go
But the smell of your skin makes me stay
You are not mine to ask things of
But I ask you anyway, I ask you anyway

Incredible love, you fill me
Incredible love, you spill me
Incredible love, you kill me
Incredible love, incredible love

You take it away but then you give it right back
Just take it away and don't give it back
Don't give it back, don't give it back
Don't give it back, don't give it right back
Don't give it right back, don't give it back

Incredible love, incredible love, incredible love
Incredible love, incredible love, incredible love

Incredible love, you fill me
Incredible love, you spill me
Incredible love, you kill me
Incredible love, incredible love
Incredible love, incredible love
