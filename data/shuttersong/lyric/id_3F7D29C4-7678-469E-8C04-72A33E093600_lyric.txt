Do you wanna build a snowman?
Come on, let's go and play!
I never see you anymore
Come out the door
It's like you've gone away

We used to be best buddies
And now we're not
I wish you would tell me why!

Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman...

Okay, bye...

Do you wanna build a snowman?
Or ride our bikes around the halls?
I think some company is overdue
I've started talking to
The pictures on the walls!

All these empty rooms
Just watching the hours tick by...

Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman...

It's just you and me
What are we gonna do?

Do you wanna build a snowman?

Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman...

Okay, bye...

Okay, bye...
