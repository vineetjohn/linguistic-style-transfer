Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to
Strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about

Strawberry fields forever
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone
But it all works out

It doesn't matter much to me
Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to
Strawberry fields
Nothing is real

And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever

No one I think is in my tree
I mean, it must be high or low

That is, you can't, you know, tune in
But it's all right
That is, I think it's not too bad
Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to

Strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever
•••

Always, no sometimes, think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know I mean a yes
But it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree
Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to
Strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields forever
