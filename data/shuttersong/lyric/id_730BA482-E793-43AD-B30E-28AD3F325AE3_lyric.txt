When the white flag sails, covered in streaks of blood
There'll be an endless sea, of us rising up
And the preacher man, and the preacher's son
Will stand arm in arm, just like everyone

We longing to be free, I won't let you fade away
We shed so many dreams, I won't let them fade away

In the hands of love, we carry on
Stronger than we started
The ash and blood, the trail behind us
Wicked is the blinded
Who we are comes to life, yeah
Who we are comes to life

When the water spills, the glass will break
It drips like tears, running up your face
And the hounds will cry, for the dogs of war
But the sons of joy, their victory will soar

We longing to be free, I won't let you fade away
We shed so many dreams, I won't let them fade away

In the hands of love, we carry on
Stronger than we started
The ash and blood, the trail behind us
Wicked is the blinded
Who we are comes to life, yeah
Who we are comes to life

(Ooooooh) 3x

We longing to be free, I won't let you fade away

In the hands of love, we carry on
Stronger than we started
The ash and blood, the trail behind us
Wicked is the blinded
Who we are comes to life, yeah
Who we are comes to life
We come alive
We come alive
We come alive
We come alive
We come to life
