"Steal My Girl"

[Zayn Malik:]
She been my queen
Since we were sixteen
We want the same things,
We dream the same dreams,
Alright (alright)

I got it all
'Cause she is the one
Her mom calls me 'love',
Her dad calls me 'son',
Alright (alright)

[Niall Horan:]
I know, I know, I know for sure

[All x2:]
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me

Na na na na na na (oh, yeah)
Na na na na na na (alright)

Kisses like cream,
Her walk is so mean
And every jaw drop
When she's in those jeans,
Alright (alright)

[Louis Tomlinson:]
I don't exist
If I don't have her
The sun doesn't shine,
The world doesn't turn,
Alright (alright)

She knows, she knows
That I'm never gonna let another take her love from me now
