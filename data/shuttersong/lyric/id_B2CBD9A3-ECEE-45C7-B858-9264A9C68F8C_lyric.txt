"They Don't Know About Us"

People say we shouldn¡¯t be together
We're too young to know about forever
But I say they don¡¯t know what they're talk-talk-talkin¡¯ about (talk-talk-talkin¡¯ about)

'Cause this love is only getting stronger
So I don¡¯t wanna wait any longer
I just wanna tell the world that you're mine, girl
Oh

They don¡¯t know about the things we do
They don¡¯t know about the "I love you"¡¯s
But I bet you if they only knew (they don't know)
They would just be jealous of us,
They don¡¯t know about the up all nights
They don¡¯t know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby they don¡¯t know about, they don¡¯t know about us

One touch and I was a believer
Every kiss it gets a little sweeter
It¡¯s getting better
Keeps getting better all the time, girl

They don¡¯t know about the things we do
They don¡¯t know about the "I love you"¡¯s
But I bet you if they only knew (they don't know)
They would just be jealous of us,
They don¡¯t know about the up all nights
They don¡¯t know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby they don¡¯t know about, they don¡¯t know about us

They don¡¯t know how special you are
They don¡¯t know what you¡¯ve done to my heart
They can say anything they want
'Cause they don¡¯t know us

They don¡¯t know what we do best
It's between me and you, our little secret
But I wanna tell 'em
I wanna tell the world that you're mine, girl

They don¡¯t know about the things we do
They don¡¯t know about the "I love you"¡¯s (I love you)
But I bet you if they only knew (if they only knew)
They would just be jealous of us (they would just be jealous of us),
They don¡¯t know about the up all nights
They don¡¯t know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right (feels so right)
Baby they don¡¯t know about, they don¡¯t know about us

They don¡¯t know about the things we do
They don¡¯t know about the "I love you"¡¯s
But I bet you if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us,
They don¡¯t know about the up all nights
They don¡¯t know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby they don¡¯t know about, they don¡¯t know about us

They don¡¯t know about us
They don¡¯t know about us
