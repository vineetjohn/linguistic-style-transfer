 behind the club on the weekends
Acting stupid getting d with my best friends
I couldn't wait for  the summer at  the Warped Tour
I remember that it's  the first time that I saw her there
She's getting kicked out of school cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous cause I think all her friends hate me
She's  the  one she'll always be there
She took my hand and I made it I swear
Cause I fell in love with  the girl at  the rock show
She said What I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool better sneak me in through  the window
Everything's better when she's around
Can't wait until her parents go out of town
I fell in love with  the girl at  the rock show
When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember  the look her mother gave us
Seventeen without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fuckin' explanation
Cause I fell in love with  the girl at  the rock show
She said What I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool better sneak me in through  the window
Everything's better when she's around
Can't wait until her parents go out of town
I fell in love with  the girl at  the rock show
Black and white pictures of her  on my wall
I waited for her call she always kept me waiting
And if I ever got another chance I'd still ask her to dance
Because she kept me waiting
Cause I fell in love with  the girl at  the rock show
She said What I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool better sneak me in through  the window
Everything's better when she's around
Can't wait until her parents go out of town
I fell in love with  the girl at  the rock show
With  the girl at  the rock show
With  the girl at  the rock show
