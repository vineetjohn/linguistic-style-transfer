My hands, your hands
Tied up like two ships
Drifting, weightless

Waves try to break it

I'd do anything to save it
Why is it so hard to save it?

My heart, your heart
Sit tight like bookends
Pages between us
Written with no end

So many words we're not saying
Don't wanna wait 'til it's gone
You make me strong

I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?
That you make me strong

Think of how much
Love that's been wasted
People always
Trying to escape it

Move on to stop their heart breaking
But there's nothing I'm running from
You make me strong

I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?

So baby hold on to my heart, oh
Need you to keep me from falling apart
I'll always hold on
'Cause you make me strong

I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?

I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?
That you make me...

I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?
That you make me strong
