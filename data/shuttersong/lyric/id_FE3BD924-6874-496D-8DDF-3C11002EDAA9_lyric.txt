The summer's over and we're watchin' the sun finally set
Seems like it's forever now, but forever's here
Cruise out of the town in a rental
The scene and the silence crescendo
But you the only one I miss
Cause you the only one I.
Summer's over, and I feel the same way you do
Yea, yea
Come on baby, girl come on
Come on baby, girl come on
You don't want a lazy lover
Just switch you might find another
Come on baby, come oh girl
Come home baby, come home girl
How you feelin', how you feel?
Let a real one take the wheel
Girl the summer's fallin' and we're watchin' the sun finally set
Sometimes I hear the ocean, while drivin' down Oceans
Girl the ocean's callin' your name
Come on baby
Come home baby
How you feelin' how you feel?
Let a real one take the wheel
