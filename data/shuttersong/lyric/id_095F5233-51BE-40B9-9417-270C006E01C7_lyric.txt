The concierge was cold,
The water pipes had mold all over them
The room was fit for two,
The bed was left in ruins
The neighbor was knocking, yeah

Touch me, yeah
I want you to touch me there

Feel like I am human

A vodka and a sprite
A glimpse of the silhouettes
A night that they never forget

Touch me, yeah
I want you to touch me there
Make me feel like I am breathing
Feel like I am human

Touch me, yeah
I want you to touch me there
Make me feel like I am breathing
Feel like I am human

Touch me, yeah
I want you to touch me there
Make me feel like I am breathing
Feel like I am human

Touch me, yeah
I want you to touch me there
Make me feel like I am breathing
Feel like I am human, again
