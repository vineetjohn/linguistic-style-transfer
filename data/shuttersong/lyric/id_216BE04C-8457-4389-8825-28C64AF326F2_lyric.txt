Take my money

Black jeans, white tees, black Converse
You know she gets it right
Blue hair, blue eyes, I saw her
I couldn't help it, I was like
"I wanna be, be, be in the game
I wanna know, know your middle name
If we can go, go, it won't be the same
Cause right now you're killing the game"

Everybody's gonna go big tonight
In a couple hours we'll be like

Take my money, take my keys
Drive this car through the drive-thru please
From the floor to the ceiling, robbing and stealing
Everybody in the place catch that feeling like
Ooooh ooooh
Take my money

Late night, passed out in Tokyo
New York, LA, Chicago
She said her friends were at the show
Backstage, will let them in
"They wanna be, be, be in the game
They wanna know, know what we gotta say
And in the front row, you're going insane
And in the back row you're killing the game"

Everybody's gonna go big tonight
In a couple hours we'll be like

Take my money, take my keys
Drive this car through the drive-thru please
From the floor to the ceiling, robbing and stealing
Everybody in the place catch that feeling like

Take my money, take my keys
Drive this car through the drive-thru please
From the floor to the ceiling, robbing and stealing
Everybody in the place, you can all
Take my money, take my keys
Drive this car through the drive-thru please
From the floor to the ceiling, robbing and stealing
Everybody in the place catch that feeling like
Ooooh ooooh
Take my money, take my money

Ka-ching!
