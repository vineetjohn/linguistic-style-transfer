Is Mercury in retrograde?
Or is that the excuse that I've always made?
'Cause I wanna blame you,
But I can only blame myself

Yeah, it's easy to throw you under the bus
Or call you crazy, while filling my cup
I say these things to hurt you
But I only hurt myself
Oh, I can only take responsibility for me

It takes two, two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh yeah

It takes two, two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first baby to say "I'm sorry", "I'm sorry"

I face my demons, yeah, I paid my dues
I had to grow up, I wish you could too
I wanted to save you, but I can only save myself

Oh, I can only be the change I want to see
Yeah, to see

It takes two, two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, yeah ohh

It takes two, two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first baby to say "I'm sorry", "I'm sorry"

I point my finger but it does me no good
I look in the mirror and it tells me the truth, yeah
Why all these lessons always learned the hard way
Is it too late to change?

Ohh, It takes two, two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
And I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh

It takes two, two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first baby to say "I'm sorry", "I'm sorry", "I'm sorry"
