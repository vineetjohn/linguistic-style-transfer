I Am Beautiful - Candice Glover
You say I sound silly when I laugh real loud
Talk about my day and you tune me out
You keep telling me lies to make things worse
But I don't hear you
'Cause I'm listening to his words
And he says I am beautiful
And when I fall
It don't matter that I'm not perfect
I am beautiful
I'm not alone
And in his eyes I'm so worth it
I'm worth every tear
And every scar
And even when you say I'm not
He says I'm beautiful
You say I'll never be good enough
Knock me down
Won't help me up
And you always say the right thing to make me hurt
But I don't hear you
'Cause I'm listening to his words
And he says I am beautiful
And when I fall
It don't matter that I'm not perfect
I am beautiful
I'm not alone
And in his eyes I'm so worth it
I'm worth every tear
And every scar
And even when you say I'm not
He says I'm beautiful
And I deserve better things
He says he understands
I got to do whats right for me
And he says I am beautiful
And when I fall
It don't matter that I'm not perfect
I am beautiful
I'm not alone
And in his eyes I'm so worth it
I'm worth every tear
And every scar
And even when you say I'm not
He says I'm beautiful
He says
He says
I'm beautiful
And I'm worth every tear
And every scar
And even when you say I'm not
He says I'm beautiful
