[Hook - Justin Bieber:]
Playtime is over, over (say what)
I got no time to play no games with you
Playtime is over, over
I got no time to play no games with you

[Verse 1 - Justin Bieber:]
No more playing games
No more arguing, asking me where I'm gonna be
Such a waste of time
There's no need to fight (there's no need to fight)
I want to spend that time laughing out loud
Cause there ain't really no time for arguing no

[Khalil & Justin Bieber:]
Playtime is over, over
I got no time to play no games with you
I got no time to play no games with you
Playtime is over, over, over
I got no time to play no games with you

[Bridge - Khalil & Justin Bieber:]
Hard to move on
So don't push me away, to get to my heart
Don't play no games (don't play no games)
I got no time to play no games with you

[Verse 2 - Khalil:]
I won't say no names, I won't say no names
But you're playing games
Seen it clearly, girl you just ain't being a saint (oh no)
Just saying what's on my mind, I hope you feel my pain
Well girl I guess it's just a part of love
But I hope you know that you're the one I'm dreaming of

[Hook - Justin Bieber:]
Playtime is over, over
I got no time to play no games with you
Playtime is over, over
I got no time to play no games with you

[Bridge - Justin Bieber:]
Hard to move on
So don't push me away to get to my heart
Don't play no games
Playtime is over, I got no time to play no games with you
