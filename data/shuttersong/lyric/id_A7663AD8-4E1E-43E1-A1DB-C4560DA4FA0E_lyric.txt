She's on a strict diet, that's my baby
With no makeup she a ten
And she the best with that head

She don't want money
She want the time we could spend
She said, "Cause I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody"
Girl, I fuck who I want and fuck who I don't
Got that A1 credit and that fillet mignon
She said, "I never wanna make you mad
I just wanna make you proud."
I said, "Baby just make me cum,
Then don't make a sound."
