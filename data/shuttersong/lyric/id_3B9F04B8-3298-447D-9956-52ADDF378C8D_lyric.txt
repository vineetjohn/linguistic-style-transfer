Keep it a hundred in the fast lane, so high
Like Amber Rose without the foreplay, four fives
We gettin' money, baby, no shame, hold tight
You take a selfie, girl, you're so vein, don't lie
You know I love it, baby, no way, oh my
You know I like the way you rotate, close thighs
Coco Cubano in your Dolce, all lies
It's not my lady, but it's okay, I know why
You're super wavy, baby
Baby, you're my cup of tea
And I really wanna be in your company
Any good thing comin' is gon' come to me
When I pop, pop in your dungarees
And again, 20 and 0, undefeated
The batty so big, my squad don't believe it

And haters gonna diss like Drizzy, like Chris like
Trippin', this is it life, now I'm singin' this like

We grew up learning things the hard way, close ties
You only make it if you grow free, don't die
Remember startin' up my own wave, won't lie
I used to bus it, baby, no train, no sky
Now when you bus it baby throw shade on those guys
You know I liked you back in '08, '09
You used to call me on my house phone, late night
My mum complainin' but it's okay, it's your time
Protecfully, my baby
Baby, you're my cup of tea
And I really wanna be in your company

Cause the whole industry is tryna come for me
Dirty pictures on the 'Gram, save some for me
Hotter than 81 degrees
Yeah, none of them girls got nothin' on your steez
Yeah and haters gettin' dissed like smiley with a kiss like
Scrollin' through your pics like, got me singin' this like
