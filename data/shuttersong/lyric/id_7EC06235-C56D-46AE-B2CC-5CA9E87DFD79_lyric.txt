Straight for your heart
Straight for your heart

I see you I see your soul clear
I know you wanna disappear 
You wonder who will notice
If you gave up the fight
Some days you feel invisible, out of sight
Right here, right now, tonight

I¡¯m coming straight for your heart
I¡¯m bringing light to the dark
It¡¯s gonna catch like a flame
Everything¡¯s about to change
All is takes is a spark
To bring hope where you are
Cuz you¡¯re never too far
No you¡¯re never too far
Coming straight for your heart
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart) [4x]
straight for your heart

Your heart beats
But it¡¯s just keeping time
Your living but you don¡¯t feel alive
The world outside is turning
While yours in laying still
In the cycle, spinning spiral, holding you until 
Right here, right now, tonight

I¡¯m coming straight for your heart
I¡¯m bringing light to the dark
It¡¯s gonna catch like a flame
Everything's about to change
All is takes is a spark
To bring hope where you are
Cuz you¡¯re never too far
No you¡¯re never too far
I¡¯m coming straight for your heart
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart) [4x]
straight for your heart

You don¡¯t have to walk this road alone
I¡¯ll hold you, hold you
You don¡¯t have to live this life alone
I know you, know you

Hidden in the tunnel
I¡¯ll be there
Even when you can¡¯t fly
I¡¯ll be there [3x]

I¡¯m coming straight for your heart
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart) [4x]

I¡¯m coming straight for your heart
I¡¯m bringing light to the dark
It¡¯s gonna catch like a flame
Everything's about to change
All is takes is a spark
To bring hope where you are
Cuz you¡¯re never too far
No you¡¯re never too far
I¡¯m coming straight for your heart
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart) [4x]
straight for your heart

You don¡¯t have to walk this road alone
I¡¯ll hold you, hold you
You don¡¯t have to live this life alone
I know you, know you
