Black is my favourite color
Makes me feel like we know each other
Blank tapes and posters on the door.

Listen to my Pink Floyd cover
Take a seat like a backbeat lover
Mixed tapes and cushions on the floor.

I Sold My Bed
But Not My Stereo
I Sold My Bed
But Not My Stereo

(Sold My Bed)
(Sold My, Sold My...)
Paper bags and escalators

Pushing up those broken faders
Only way to find out who you are
In a town of ones and zeros

You are one magnetic hero
Little things will always get you far
I Sold My Bed
But Not My Stereo
I Sold My Bed
But Not My Stereo
I Sold My Bed
But Not My Stereo

Black is my favorite color
Makes me feel like we know each other
In a town of ones and zeros
You are one magnetic hero

I Sold My Bed
But Not My Stereo
I Sold My Bed
But Not My Stereo
I Sold My Bed
But Not My Stereo
I Sold My Bed
But Not My Stereo
