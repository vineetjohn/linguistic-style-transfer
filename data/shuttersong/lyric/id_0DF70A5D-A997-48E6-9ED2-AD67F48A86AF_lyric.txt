Live it up up I
Live it up up I
Live it up up I

A thousand people stood in line
To hear a couple words of mine
Afraid I would miss a beat
And everyone is watching me
I don't know why I'm still afraid
It's not like it was yesterday
I'm the one stopping me
From all the I want to be

It's ridiculous
The stars are inconspicuous
I told myself this can't be how I think
It's irrational
It seems so supernatural
I'm happy every after all I've seen

I'm unstoppable
I drop kick impossible
I live it up, live it up, up I
I live it up, live it up, up I
I break down the walls
I back hand and smash em all
I live it up, live it up, up I
I live it up, live it up, up I

Live it up, up I
Live it up, up I

Don't know why my stomach drops
Like jumping off a mountain top
I used to be fearless when, I had my safety net
Wake up my heart is beating fast
'Cause I ain't got no strings attached
Free to go anywhere, everywhere
It's just that I don't know where

It's ridiculous
There thoughts are inconspicuous
I told myself this can't be how I think
It's irrational
It seems so supernatural
I'm happy every after all I've seen

I'm unstoppable
I drop kick impossible
I live it up, live it up, up I
Live it up, live it up, up I
I break down the walls
I back up, smashing ball
I live it up, live it up, up I
Live it up, live it up, up I

Live it up, up I
Live it up, up I

No I'm not afraid
No I'm not afraid
Live it up, up I (No I'm not afraid)
No, yeah, yeah

I'm unstoppable
I drop kick impossible
I live it up, live it up, up I
Live it up, live it up, up I
I break down the walls
I back hand and smash em all
I live it up, live it up, up I
I live it up, live it up, up I

Live it up, live it up baby
Live it up, live it up baby
Live it up, live it up baby
Live it up, live it up baby
Live it up, live it up baby
Live it up, live it up baby
Live it up, live it up baby
