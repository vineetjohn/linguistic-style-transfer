I'm hurting baby
I'm broken down
I need your loving  loving
I need it now
When I'm without you
I'm something weak
You got me begging  begging
I'm on my knees
I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killing me when you're away
Ooh baby
Cause a bullet don't care
Where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste
Sugar
Yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me
Oh right here  cause I need
Little love and little sympathy
Yeah you show me good loving
Make it alright
Need a little a sweetness in my life
Sugar
Yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me
My broken pieces
You put them up
Don't leave me hanging  hanging
Come get me some
When I'm without ya
So insecure
You are the one thing  one thing
I'm living for
I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killing me when you're away
Ooh baby
Cause a bullet don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste
Sugar
Yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me
Oh right here  cause I need
Little love and little sympathy
Yeah you show me good loving
Make it alright
Need a little a sweetness in my life
Sugar
Yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me
Yeah
I want that red velvet
I want that sugar sweet
Don't let nobody touch it
Unless that somebody is me
I gotta be a man
There ain't no other way
Cause girl you're hotter
Than a southern california bae
I don't wanna play no games
I don't gotta be afraid
Don't give all that shy shit
No make up on
That's my
