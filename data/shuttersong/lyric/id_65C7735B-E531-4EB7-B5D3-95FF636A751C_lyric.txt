We were born for greater things
We were born to chase your dreams
Come my Lord, awaken holy fire
We are turning from our sin
We are praying once again
Come my Lord, awaken holy fire
We are aching for the real thing
Hearts are open wide

Burn like a star, light a fire in our hearts
Burn like a star, light a fire in our hearts
Burn like a star, light a fire in our hearts
Burn like a star, light a fire in our hearts

Send revival; start in us
Set your holy spark in us
Send us out in resurrection power
History's about to change
We are rising once again
Send us out in resurrection power
We are aching for the real thing
Hearts are open wide

Burn like a star, light a fire in our hearts
Burn like a star, light a fire in our hearts
Burn like a star, light a fire in our hearts
Burn like a star, light a fire in our hearts
For your glory, for your fame
in this darkness, light a flame in us

Burn like a star, light a fire in our hearts
Burn like a star, light a fire in our hearts
Burn like a star, light a fire in our hearts
Burn like a star, light a fire in our hearts
Burn like a star, light a fire in our hearts
Burn like a star, light a fire in our hearts
Burn like a star, light a fire in our hearts
Burn like a star, light a fire
Burn like a star, light a fire in our hearts
Burn like a star, light a fire in our hearts
Burn like a star, light a fire in our hearts
Burn like a star, light a fire in our hearts
For your glory, for your fame
in this darkness, light a flame in us
