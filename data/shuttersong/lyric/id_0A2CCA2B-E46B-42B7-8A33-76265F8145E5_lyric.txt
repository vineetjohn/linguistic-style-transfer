Your eyes are blue like the ocean 
And baby I'm lost out at sea
Did the sun just come out or did you smile at me
I've been trying to ask you but I can't seem to speak
Was it love at first sight 'cause I walked by last week
I'm singing Fa la la la la

Your lips look so lonely 
Would they like to meet mine
You are the one that I've been hoping to find
You're so sweet that you 
Put Hersheys out of business
Can I have a photograph to show my friends that
Angels truly exist
I'm singing Fa la la la la

You're as cute as a button
The things you do sure are something
Are you running out of breath 
From running through my head all night

Is there something in your eye, oh
wait, it's just a sparkle
Can you get a little closer 
And help me out a little bit
I scraped my knee fallin' for you
But baby a kiss will do
I'm singing Fa la la la la la

You're as cute as a button
The things you do sure are something
Are you running out of breath 
From running through my head all night

I'm falling in love and wouldn't I like to think so
And every night I look at the stars out my window
And I hope I can see 
The one that we saw together
It was just you and me and honestly 
I'll look for that star forever

I'm falling in love and wouldn't I like to think so
And every night I look at the stars out my window
And I hope I can see 
The one that we saw together
It was just you and me and honestly 
I'll look for that star forever 

You're as cute as a button
The things you do sure are
something
Are you running out of breath 
From running through my head all night 

You're as cute as a button
The things you do sure are
something
Are you running out of breath 
From running through my head all night
