She paints her nails
And she don't know
He's got her best friend on the phone
She'll wash her hair
His dirty clothes
Are all he gives to her

And he's got posters on the wall
Of all the girls he wished she was
And he means everything to her

Her boyfriend
He don't know
Anything about her
He's too stoned
Nintendo
I wish that I could make her see
She's just the flavor of the weak

It's Friday night
And she's all alone
He's a million miles away
She's dressed to kill
The TV's on
He's connected to the sound

And he's got pictures on the wall
Of all the girls he's loved before
And she knows all his favorite songs

Her boyfriend
He don't know
Anything about her
He's too stoned
Nintendo
I wish that I could make her see
She's just the flavor of the weak
Yeah!

Her boyfriend
He don't know
Anything about her
He's too stoned
He's too stoned
He's too stoned
He's too stoned

Her boyfriend
He don't know
Anything about her
He's too stoned
Nintendo
I wish that I could make her see
She's just the flavor of the weak
Yeah she's the flavor of the weak
She makes me weak
