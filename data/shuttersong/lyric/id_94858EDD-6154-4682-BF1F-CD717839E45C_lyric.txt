This growing old is getting old
I often find myself here thinking
About the birds, the boats, and past loves
that flew away or started sinking
And it's crazy here without you
I used to think this all was ours
We stay up late debate
On how we find our way
You say, "It's all up in the stars"

Well, Some nights I rule the world
With bar lights and pretty girls
But most nights I stay straight
And think about my mom, Oh God
I miss her so much

And there are people on the street
They're coming up to me
And they're telling me
That they like what I do now
And so I tried my best when I took the fall
And get back right up and get in your arms
If you're out here why do I miss you so much?

I feel like I had it all
Back before I lost it all
Now I just wait for you to talk to me
But you won't even look at me, baby

And I've been saying that you
You're always holding onto stars
I think they're better from afar
cause no one (here) is going to save us
¡°
You're always holding onto stars
¡ª Fun.
Oh, and me
Well I am fading in the dark
So don't you ever kiss me
Don't you wish on me
Why can't you see
That no one's going to save us?
Come on, girl

Come on girl
So should I or did I
I can't believe you'd do those things
I just need a helping hand
I close my eyes and think about tomorrow
It never came true
It came true
It never came true

And you, you're always holding onto stars
You're always holding onto stars
cause no one (here) is going to save us

Oh and you, you're always holding onto stars
I think they're better from afar
cause no one (here) is going to save us
Oh and me, Well I am fading in the dark
So don't you ever kiss me
Don't you wish on me
Why can't you see that
No one is going to save us.
No one is going to save me.

No, no, no.
You're always holding onto stars
You're always holding onto stars
You're always holding onto stars
You're always holding onto stars
You're always holding onto stars
You're always holding onto stars
You're always holding onto stars
