Sometimes life it takes you by the hair
It pulls you down before you know it
It's gone and you're dead again.
I've been in places and I won't pretend
That I'd make it out just to fall on my head

Wake up strange and take the walk downstairs
Hit the pawn up on the corner and pay for my rent
You know that I could not believe my own truth
Just show them what I choose, got nothing to lose

Yeah yeah and it's O.K.
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way.
Yeah yeah and I'm alright.
I took a sip of something poisoned but I'll hold on tight.

You know those days when you want to just choose
To not get out of bed, you're lost in your head again.
You play the game but you kind of cut
'Cause you're coming down hard and your joints are all stuck.
I tried to say that's not the only way
I never knew if I could face myself to change.
You were pacing I was insecure.
Slip and fall, I got the calls from the prison I've been living in.

Yeah yeah and it's O.K.
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way.
Yeah yeah and I'm alright.
I took a sip of something poisoned but I'll hold on tight.

Yeah yeah and it's O.K.
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way.
Yeah yeah and I'm alright.
I took a sip of something poisoned,
Took a sip of something poisoned, poisoned.

Yeah yeah and it's O.K.
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way.
Yeah yeah and I'm alright.
I took a sip of something poisoned but I'll hold on tight.

Yeah yeah and it's O.K.
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way.
Yeah yeah and I'm alright.
I took a sip of something poisoned, took a sip of something poisoned, poisoned
