Fuck what they talkin' 'bout
All a nigga hear is my chains
Clinkin' back and fourth right now nigga

Yeah
fuck with me

Why the fuck you so opinionated
Sayin' how you do it but they ain't did it baby
You need a demonstration
This is how you get richer baby
I'm stimulated
I'm at the bank, I'm penetratin'
I'm puttin' in, I'm penetratin'
I'm getting big, I'm stimulated
I touched the bitch she disintegrated
Up in flames, I've been the flamest
I've been the hottest you've been the lamest
I've been on a plane, you've been complainin'

Fuck the codefendant, pistol whip the plaintiff

Hit the mall, then we skip arraignment
They say she young, I should've waited
She a big girl, dog when she stimulated

Hit Sin City and syndicate it
All the time on the strip in Vegas
I got the juice but I ain't Minute Maid it
But a nigga made it just minutes later
Shut the fuck up and let me finish baby
Ill let you finish later
Why the fuck you so opinionated?
Yeah you book smart but don't be gettin' paper
Shootin' craps at the wind
Getting' back to back wins
Made 20 bands playin' features
And I don't need a feature for this
Nigga I'm T-R-A, a triple double
Everytime I ball, man that's triple double
Tom Ford, Balmain, that's triple stuntin'
Tryna get a nut only gets you nothin'
So I don't give a fuck who these niggas datin
Tsunami the Rollie, my wrist is flooded
How the fuck can these niggas hate it
When these bitches love it, man this shit is funny
All I can do is laugh, all I can do is laugh
They try to count me out all day I'm doin math

All I can do is add, multiply, multiply all day I'm doin math
But we wont divide you ain't got the flow, you ain't got the heart

You be on your mark but you're never ready
You just talkin shit I can smell your breath
Sayin what you do but you cant help yourself

So why the fuck you so opinionated
Sayin' how you do it but they ain't did it baby
You need a demonstration
This is how you get richer baby
I'm stimulated
I'm at the bank, I'm penetratin'
I'm puttin' in, I'm penetratin'
I'm getting big, I'm stimulated
I touched the bitch she disintegrated

Up in flames, I've been the flamest
I've been the hottest you've been the lamest
I've been on a plane, you've been complainin'

Fuck the codefendant, pistol whip the plaintiff
Hit the mall, then we skip arraignment
They say she young, I should've waited

She a big girl, dog when she stimulated
