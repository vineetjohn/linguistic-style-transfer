Firework - Katy Perry\n Do you ever feel like a plastic bag\n Drifting throught the wind\n Wanting to start again\n Do you ever feel  feel so paper thin\n Like a house of cards\n One blow from caving in\n Do you ever feel already buried deep\n Six feet under scream\n But no one seems to hear a thing\n Do you know that there's still a chance for you\n Cause there's a spark in you\n You just gotta ignite the light\n And let it shine\n Just own the night\n Like the Fourth of July\n Cause baby you're a firework\n Come on show 'em what your worth\n Make 'em go "Oh  oh  oh "\n As you shoot across the sky-y-y\n Baby you're a firework\n Come on let your colors burst\n Make 'em go "Oh  oh  oh "\n You're gonna leave 'em fallin' down-own-own\n You don't have to feel like a waste of space\n You're original  cannot be replaced\n If you only knew what the future holds\n After a hurricane comes a rainbow\n Maybe your reason why all the doors are closed\n So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road\n Like a lightning bolt  your heart will blow\n And when it's time  you'll know\n You just gotta ignite the light\n And let it shine\n Just own the night\n Like the Fourth of July\n Cause baby you're a firework\n Come on show 'em what your worth\n Make 'em go "Oh  oh  oh "\n As you shoot across the sky-y-y\n Baby you're a firework\n Come on let your colors burst\n Make 'em go "Oh  oh  oh "\n You're gonna leave 'em fallin' down-own-own\n Boom  boom  boom\n Even brighter than the moon  moon  moon\n It's always been inside of you  you  you\n And now it's time to let it through\n Cause baby you're a firework\n Come on show 'em what your worth\n Make 'em go "Oh  oh  oh "\n As you shoot across the sky-y-y\n Baby you're a firework\n Come on let your colors burst\n Make 'em go "Oh  oh  oh "\n You're gonna leave 'em goin "Oh  oh  oh "\n Boom  boom  boom\n Even brighter than the moon  moon  moon\n Boom  boom  boom\n Even brighter than the moon  moon  moon
