Have a merry little Christmas, baby
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends, who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough

So have yourself a merry little Christmas now, oh yeah
Have a merry little Christmas, baby
Have a merry little Christmas, baby, oh yeah
Have a merry little Christmas, baby (Have a merry little Christmas)
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends, who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
So have yourself a merry little Christmas
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Have yourself a merry little Christmas now
