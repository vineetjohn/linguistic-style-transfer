Sugar, sugar

She sits alone waiting for suggestions
He's so nervous, avoiding all the questions
His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so, tell me so, baby

He's acting shy, looking for an answer
Come on honey, let's spend the night together
Now hold on a minute before we go much further
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother

They catch a cab to his high rise apartment
At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on honey, tell me so
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on sugar, let me know

His heart's beating like a drum
'Cause at last he's got this girl home
Relax baby, now we are alone

They wake at dawn 'cause all the birds are singin'
Two total strangers but that ain't what they're thinkin'
Outside it's cold, misty and it's rainin'
They got each other, neither one's complainin'

He say's, \
