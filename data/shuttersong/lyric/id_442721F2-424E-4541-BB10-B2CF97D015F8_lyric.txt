"Back To The Start"

That just straps up your heart.
And you're back to the start again.

She wanted my heart,
Wanted my soul,
Wanted that loving
But I ain't tryna hold on to her heart
To see it fold.
Girl's holding on to the thought so tight
Holding on for her life
I just might have to give it to her,
For one loving night.
She whispers so slow
Said to my ear, "I love Somo."
I said, "you just wanna get in my pants,
Cause I'm 'bout to get that dough."
She says, "I like it fast."
I say, "Why you gotta rev my gas?"
Next thing I know,
I'm standing in my front door tryna stop my hands

I just wanna take your picture
Go 'head stand there in the door
Let's get naughty, let's get naughty
Take your body to the floor
Toot that thing and make it drop
Come over and show me more
Hold me softly, I'll keep going
Till you're screaming and you're sore

And we live for that rush.
And we rush for that love.
And we love for that one
That just straps up your heart.
And you're back to the start again
That just straps up your heart.
And you're back to the start

She's dripping to the core
Says to me, "can I explore
Your body, feeling exotic
And I just need a little tour."
We start off just by touching
Then we go on to rubbing
She says "I'm on top
Let me ride."
I say, "uh-uh, I'm a get that loving."
I thought you could take it fast
Yeah, you like it when I slap your ass
Take it all, I'm a go deep
Keep it so sweet, one night to make it last
She's close, I'm about to wrap
She can't open up her eyes
I'm driving deep and her body's so weak
And I can't let go inside

I just wanna take your picture
Go 'head stand there in the door
Let's get naughty, let's get naughty
Take your body to the floor
Toot that thing and make it drop
Come over and show me more
Hold me softly, I'll keep going
Till you're screaming and you're sore

And we live for that rush.
And we rush for that love.
And we love for that one
That just straps up your heart.
And you're back to the start again
And she prays for the love
So I stay and re-run
Sends a wish on a star
Now just wraps up her heart
We were trapped from the start

So we live for that rush.
And we rush for that love.
And we love for that one
That just straps up your heart.
And you're back to the start again
Why can't we just hold on to one, one, one, one, one...
