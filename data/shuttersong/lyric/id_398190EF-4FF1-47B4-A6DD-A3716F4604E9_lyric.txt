Here we are in this big old empty room, staring each other down
U want me just as much as I want U, let's stop fooling around
Take me baby... kiss me all over... play with my love
Bring out what's been in me for far too long
Baby, u know that's all I've been dreaming of
Do Me Baby, like u never done before
Give it to me till I just can't take no more
Do Me Baby, like u never done before
I want u now, I just can't wait no more, can't wait...

Here we are looking for a reason for u to lay me down
For a love like ours is never out of season, so baby please stop teasing me
what ya do, I can never love no other, u're the best I ever had
Whenever we're not close to one another, I just want u so bad

So Do Me Baby, like u never done before
Give it to me till I just can't take no more
C'mon, Do Me Baby, like u never done before
