They were sitting
They were sitting in the strawberry swing
Every moment was so precious

They were sitting
They were talking in the strawberry swing
Everybody was for fighting
Wouldn't want to waste a thing

Cold cold water, bring me 'round
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Cold cold water, whatcha say?
It's such, it's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

I remember
We were walking up to strawberry swing
I can't wait 'til the morning
Wouldn't want to change a thing

People moving all the time
Inside a perfectly straight line
Don't you wanna just curve away?
And it's such, it's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

Oh Aaaahh
Now the sky could be blue

I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time
Could be blue

I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time
Could be blue
Could be grey
Without you, I'm just miles away
Could be blue
I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time
