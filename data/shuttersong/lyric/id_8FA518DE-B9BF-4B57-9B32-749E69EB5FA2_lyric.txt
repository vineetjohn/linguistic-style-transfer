Big Snoop Dogg
Can you be my doctor?
Can you fix me up?
Can you wipe me down?

So I can make you give it up give it up
Until you say my name
Like a Jersey Jersey shuttin' down the game

Be my head coach
So you can...
And never take me out
Till you can taste the way
Do it again, and again till you say my name

And by the way
I'm so glad
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
Sweat, sweat

Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip
Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip

Shes hot on a rainy day
Don't drown
Call call me up, I I I can save you now
(Lick your feet and kiss your lap)?
[?]
There's only one way we can stop the drought
Come with me
We can take a trip down south

I can tell shes thirsty
I'm in the whoa like a birdy
Whatcha wanna do tonight?
It's still early

Wanna get some tonight
Shes all sturdy
I'm in I'm in
Like a cigarette
She wanna quit

I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
Sweat, sweat

Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip
Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip

Can you, can you get me up like I'm late for my first class
So I can give it to you rough like a first draft
Hold you like a paper plane
You know I got paper babe
Them dollar bills
Girl I'll make it rain

Holiday Inn
Come and meet me on my eighth floor
Damn it feels good but I feel bad for (them next door)?
And I, I I I up on the [?]
When I slip slip slip like two girls into slip n' slide

(There's a flood in your heart love)?
Girl, let me pop up in your hot tub
Every night every day,
Sippin' on a different drink
Different chicks, different tastes
I do it different ways

Where you goin?
Whatcha say?
I'm why her river flowin'
To another lake
By to ocean by the ocean
On the beach on the beach
I'm bout' to take a swim

Let me dip my feet in and make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
Sweat, sweat

Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip
Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip
