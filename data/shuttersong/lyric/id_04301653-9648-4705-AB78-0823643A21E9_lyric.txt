How many I told yous and start overs and shoulders
Have you cried on before?
How many promises, be honest girl
How many tears you let hit the floor?

How many bags you packed, just to take him back
Tell me that how many either ors
But no more if you let me inside of your inside your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

oh ho ho
Saw so many pretty faces before I saw you, you
Now all I see is you
I'm coming for you

(I'm coming for you)
Don't need these other pretty faces like I need you
And when you're mine in the world

There's gonna be one less lonely girl
I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl
I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl

Christmas wasn't merry, 14th of February
Not one of 'em spent with you
How many dinner dates, set dinner plates

And he didn't even touch his food?
How many torn photographs I saw you taping back
Tell me that you couldn't see an open door
But no more, if you let me inside your world

There'll be one less lonely girl
Saw so many pretty faces before I saw you, you
Now all I see is you

I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you

She's free to fall, fall in love with me
Her heart's locked, and know what, I got the key
