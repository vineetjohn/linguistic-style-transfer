One day the world will be gone
There'll be no one here to walk the land
One day what you know will be wrong
There'll be no one here to hold your hand

Right now we're crazy youngsters
Time is running out, but who cares we're running free
They call us crazy youngsters
We don't apologize, we're mad and running free

They call us crazy youngsters
Time is running out but who cares we're running free
Hell yeah, we're crazy youngsters
We don't apologize, we're mad and running free

(Cause we got) Hey, we got a lot of things to do (Hey)
Hey, we got a lot of things to prove
(Yeah we got) Yeah we got a lot of room to grow
(Hey) Yeah we got a lot of miles to go
So we keep driving, we keep driving

One day when the story's all told
There'll be no more words to fill the page
One night when the stars are all gone
There'll be no more light to guide the way

Right now we're crazy youngsters
Time is running out, but who cares we're running free
They call us crazy youngsters
We don't apologize, we're mad and running free

They call us crazy youngsters
Time is running out but who cares we're running free
Hell yeah, we're crazy youngsters
We don't apologize, we're mad and running free
