Boy toy named Troy, used to live in Detroit
Big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bought me Alexander McQueen
He was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them push daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit
By the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills
And he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like em boney
He want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag
And I hit him with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun

My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you got buns, hun

Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Oh my gosh, look at her butt
(Look at her butt)
Look at, look at, look at
Look, at her butt

This dude named Michael used to ride motorcycles
Dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
Real country-ass nigga
Let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep
Now he calling me NyQuil
Now that bang, bang, bang
I let him hit it cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit
By the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills
And he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like em boney
He want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag
Mayweather with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun

My anaconda don't

My anaconda don't want none
Unless you got buns, hun

Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Oh my gosh, look at her butt
(Look at her butt)
Look at, look at, look at
Look, at her butt

Little in the middle but she got much back
Little in the middle but she got much back
Little in the middle but she got much back
(Oh my God, look at her butt)

My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you got buns, hun

Don't my anaconda don't

Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Oh my gosh, look at her butt

Look at, look at, look at
Look, at her butt
