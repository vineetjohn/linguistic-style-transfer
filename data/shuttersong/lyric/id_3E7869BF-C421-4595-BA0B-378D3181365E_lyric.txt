We are the ones that no one gave a chance
We are the ones that almost lost it all
Ghosts in the hallway who never catch a glance
We are the lost
We are the lost souls
Our hearts, our souls
Are shallow empty holes
We sing this anthem for us all
We're so fucked up
Oh god we're so alone
Just close your eyes and sing along
If my heart stops beating
Will you still remember?
Will you still remember my name?
Did I get what I deserved?
We're trapped in doubt in our own minds
Ignoring all we feel inside
Forsaken, gone, forgotten
Everything has come apart
Lead us back from out the dark
Our hearts, our souls
Are shallow empty holes
We sing the anthem for us all
We're so fucked up
Oh god we're so alone
Just close your eyes and sing along
One, two
One, two, three
Let's go, go, go, go
We sing this anthem for us
All, all, all, all
Let's go, go, go, go
We sing this anthem for us
All, all, all, all
We are the lost souls
We are the lost souls
We are the lost souls
We are the lost souls
