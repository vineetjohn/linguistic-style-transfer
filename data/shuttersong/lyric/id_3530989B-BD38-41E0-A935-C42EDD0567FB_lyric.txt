"I Love You"

I fell in love with a beautiful girl
And she still takes my breath away
I fell in love in the morning sun
While the hours slipped away
Sometimes when I hear your name
A smile creeps on my face
And for reasons I can't explain
It's never out of place

'Cause I love you
More than you think I do
And I love you
Now you don't want me to
'Cause I love you
More than you think I do
And I love you
Now you don't want me to

You ran your finger down my back
And you spelled out your name
While we lay there on the soft warm ground
For a week and thirteen days

And I know that it sounds so wrong
And you've heard all this before
I didn't come back and I wasn't there
I won't trouble you no more

'Cause I love you
More than you think I do
And I love you
Now you don't want me to
'Cause I love you
More than you think I do
And I love you
Now you don't want me to

Every time I try to fight it
Everything just turns out wrong
Maybe if I got my timing right
I wouldn't end up alone

I fell in love with a beautiful boy
And you still take my breath away

When you left it was the end of my world
'Cause I never got to say

That I love you
More than you think I do
And I love you
Now you don't want me to
'Cause I love you ('Cause I love you)
More than you think I do
And I love you (I love you)
Now you don't want me to

'Cause I love you
Woah oh, woah oh, woah oh
And I love you
Woah oh, woah oh, woah oh
'Cause I love you
Woah oh, woah oh, woah oh
And I love you
Now you don't want me to
