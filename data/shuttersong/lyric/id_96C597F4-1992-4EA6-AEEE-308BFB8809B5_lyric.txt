Why do I feel this way
Why do I feel this way
When you're dancing in a trance
Your love tonight I'd take
Trying to get through to you
Baby, your red alert
I want you more and more
I want you so much it hurts

You seem so disconnective
But when I turn you on you're so effective
Pretty Polly's my electric mistress
When she's freakin' like a maniac
(She's my aphrodisiac)

Baby I can't pretend
Baby I can't pretend
There's a maniac and it's you
You're a slave to every groove
There's something in your eyes
You're not free to say
What am I going to do
You keep me on a string

You seem so disconnective
But when I turn you on you're so effective
Pretty Polly's my electric mistress
When she's freakin' like a maniac
(She's my aphrodisiac)

Why do I feel this way
Why do I feel this way
Why do I feel this way
Why do I feel this way
When you're dancing in a trance
How your love tonight I'd take
