I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love

I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
Not enough, I see you waiting
Your hands up, your body's shaking

That's hard look
I know you're faking
I know you lie, I've seen you lying
With four months in front of me
And now we're same old enemies
It's cold blooded, come back to me
Come back to me
I know you couldn't stand to be here on your own

You, you never last without someone to hold
Now you're crawling back, you forget what you are
Now you and your heart are nothing, your heart
You say you'd rather die, you got caught in a lie

Say you'd rather die when there's no one to blame
Now there's nothing left, you forget what you claim
Now you and your heart are nothing, your heart are nothing
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
Not enough, I see you waiting
Your hands up, your body's shaking

That's hard look
I know you're faking
I know you lie, I seen you lying
With four months in front of me
And now we're same old enemies
It's cold blooded, come back to me
Come back to me
I know you couldn't stand to be here on your own

You, you never last without someone to hold
Now you're crawling back, you forget what you are
Now you and your heart are nothing, your heart
You say you'd rather die, you got caught in a lie
Say you'd rather die when theres no one to blame
Now there's nothing left, you forget what you claim
Now you and your heart are nothing, your heart are nothing
