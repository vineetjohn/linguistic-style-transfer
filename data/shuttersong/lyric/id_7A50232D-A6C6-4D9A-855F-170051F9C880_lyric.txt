When the pimp's in the crib ma
Drop it like it's hot

And I'm pouring Chandon
And I roll the best weed
'Cause I got it going on

I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
See these ice cubes, see these Ice Creams?
Eligible bachelor, million dollar boat
That's whiter than what's spilling down your throat
The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs
The interior like suicide wrist red
I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
Cheat on your man ma, that's how you get ahizzead

Killer wit the beat, I know killers in the street
Wit the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat
So don't try to run up on my ear talking all that raspy shit
Trying to ask me shit
When my niggaz fill ya vest they ain't gon' pass me shit
You should think about it, take a second
Matter fact, you should take four B
And think before you fuck wit lil' skateboard P

Da Big Bo$$ Dogg, yeah, I had to do that
I keep a blue flag hanging out my backside
But only on the left side, yeah, that's the Crip side

Ain't no other way to play the game the way I play
I cut so much you thought I was a DJ
Two, one, yep, three
S N, double O, P D O, double G

I can't fake it, just break it and when I take it

See I specialize in making all the girls get naked

So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
We got a world premiere right here, now get live

So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little
I got a living room full of fine dime brizzles

Waiting on the Pizzle, the Dizzle and the Shizzle

Drive my own cars and wear my own clothes

Big Snoop Dogg, yeah, he's so sharp
On the TV screen and in the magazines
If you play me close, you're on a red beam
Oh, you got a gun so you wanna pop back?

C mid shoes, now, I'm on the move
You're family's crying, now, you on the news
They can't find you and now they miss you
Must I remind you I'm only here to twist you
Pistol whip you, dip you then flip you
Then dance to this motherfucking music we crip to
Subscribe nigga, get yo issue
