In the end
As you fade into the night
Who will tell the story of your life?
In the end

As my soul's laid to rest

What is left of my body
Or am I just a shell?
And I have fought
And with flesh and blood I commanded an army
Through it all
I have given my heart for a moment of glory (I gave it all)

In the end
As you fade into the night

Who will tell the story of your life
And who will remember your last goodbye
'Cause it's the end and I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die
Born a saint
But with every sin I still wanna be holy
I will live again
Who we are
Isn't how we live we are more than our bodies
If I fall I will rise back up and relive my glory

In the end
As you fade into the night
Who will tell the story of your life
And who will remember your last goodbye
'Cause it's the end and I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die
In the end
As you fade into the night

Who will tell the story of your life
And who will remember your last goodbye
'Cause it's the end and I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die
Who will remember this last goodbye
'Cause it's the end and I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die
