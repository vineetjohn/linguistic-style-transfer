Just give me a pen and I'll write my worries
Now and again I'll try and not see that you don't care
Taking the time to taste and savour
Life's bitter wine and childish behavior
But you don't care

And hey, I don't speak that language of youth
And hey, oh not the one that speaks truth
And hey, I lay in this world for a while
When all is lost just smile

See all the fakes that look so hollow
But you don't care
What ever happened to the youth and culture?
Wear chains and the same fecking Lonsdale jumper
So you don't care

And hey, I don't speak that language of youth
And hey, oh not the one that speaks truth
And hey, I lay in this world for a while
When all is lost just smile.
