My day one rule
Is keeping my cool
Even if I'm broken up
If you pull me high
You won't see me cry
Gotta whistle while you work it

That's why you gotta
Never let 'em see you down, see you down
Whoa o whoa, yeah
Gotta smile while you're hurting
And whistle while you work it
Whistle while you work it
Gotta smile while you're hurting
Just whistle while you work it

Rain rain go away
I can feel a cloud hangin' over me, over me
Same shit, different day
Do they get a kick outta pushin' me, pushin' me

Got lost in my head
Then my brother said
Take a breath, don't you worry child
'Cause you know where you're from
So keep moving on
And go throw on a Chelsea smile

My day one rule

Gotta whistle while you work it

That's why you gotta

Whoa o whoa, yeah
Gotta smile while you're hurting
And whistle while you work it
Whistle while you work it
Gotta smile while you're hurting
Just whistle while you work it

Brush brush, brush it off
I will never let this shit weigh me down, weigh me down
Don't cry, dry your eyes
Keep your chin up and leave it all behind, all behind

Got lost in my head
Then my brother said
Take a breath, don't you worry child

Whoa o whoa, yeah
Gotta smile while you're hurting
And whistle while you work it

Tune out of your darker side
Regret, revenge, will eat you up inside
Head up, work that dignity
Let it bounce, let it fly, and make them history

If you put in work, whistle while you work it
If you put in work, whistle while you work it
If you put in work, whistle while you work it
If you put in work, whistle while you work it

My day one rule
Is keeping my cool
Even if I'm broken up
If you pull me high
You won't see me cry
Gotta whistle while you work it
(oh)
That's why you gotta
Never let 'em see you down, see you down
Whoa o whoa, yeah
Gotta smile while you're hurting
And whistle while you work it
Whistle while you work it
Gotta smile while you're hurting
Just whistle while you work it
