I got your back boy

When we're were high, when we're were low
(From when it's all good, to when it's all bad)
When I promise I will never let you go
(Now what you call that?)

Said I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy

(Yeah, you got my back, right?)
I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy
(I know you got my back, right?)
Keep my swagger, keep it looking good for ya
Keep it looking hood for ya, and, shawty, if you don't know
I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy

(Yeah, you got my back, right?)
I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy
(Of the world though, you got my back, right?)

Hey, it's whatever shawty, you ain't gotta ask
Yes, Valentino blouses, summer houses, cash, check
You can get it, you deserve it, flawless diamonds, Louis purses

My mission's to purchase earth for her, present the gift without the curse
Her pleasure is my purpose, pleasure to be at your service
We front row at fashion shows, as well as Sunday morning service
For better days or for worse, if I'm paid I'm hurting in my pocket

She still got a nigga back, know that's for sure
No matter what may occur in life, everyday with her is like
A plus, I'ma love her 'til she be like that's enough
Pop a bottle get a couple wine glasses, fill em up

And lift 'em up, let us toast to the future, here's to us, no, here's to her

They wonder how we do what we do

Panamera Porsches, me and you
Stuck to your side like, like, like glue

Be by your side whatever you're goin' through

When we're were high, when we're were low

(From when it's all good, to when it's all bad)
When I promise I will never let you go
(Now what you call that?)
Said I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy

(Yeah, you got my back, right?)
I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy
(I know you got my back, right?)
Keep my swagger, keep it looking good for ya

Keep it looking hood for ya, and, shawty, if you don't know

I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy

(You got my back, right?)
I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy
(Of the world though, you got my back, right?)
This is for the women who man caught a sentence
Who gon' be there for a minute but they didn't keep their distance
They stayed home waiting on the phone and on visit day
Show up, looking good, smellin' better, playing kissy-face
Just wanna let you know that we appreciate
Everything you do for us on the day-to-day
And I know, we don't show you all the time
But we lucky that you ours, no bouquet of flowers
Could ever show how much we know we need you
We do all that's in our power just to please you, see boo
Fuck them girls, I would leave the World 'fore I leave you
May God say even Eve and Adam
Ain't got shit on these two

Sure enough, even though them chicks be hating on us
Still I'm gonna keep her by my side
In whatever situation we gon' ride
Make all my fantasies come alive that's no lie now
I'll be alright just as long as you beside me
Ten million dollar mansions won't suffice
If you ain't gon' be in there with me at night
The pieces to my puzzles in my life
With all of my good days and all of my bad
You stood by your man and you know you got my back
Worth every car, every bag with me they wanna be that
I know what I got at home, I ain't gon never leave that, them bitches best believethat
When we're were high, when we're were low
(From when it's all good, to when it's all bad)
When I promise I will never let you go
(Now what you call that?)
Said I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy
(Yeah, you got my back, right?)
I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy
(I know you got my back right)
Keep my swagger, keep it looking good for ya
Keep it looking hood for ya, and, shawty, if you don't know
I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy
(You got my back, right?)
I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy
(Of the world though, you got my back)
