I miss those blue eyes
How you kissed me at night
I miss the way we sleep
Like there's no sunrise
Like the taste of your smile
I miss the way we breathe

But I never told you
What I should have said
No I never told you
I just held it in
And now I miss everything about you
I can't believe that I still want you
After all the things we've been through
I miss everything about you

Without you

I see your blue eyes
Every time I close mine
You make it hard to see

Where I belong to when I'm not around you
It's like I'm not with me

But I never told you
What I should have said
No I never told you
I just held it in
And now I miss everything about you
(still you're gone)

I can't believe that I still want you
(And I'm lovin' you, I never should have walked away)
After all the things we've been through

(I know it's never gonna come again)
I miss everything about you
Without you
But I never told you
What I should have said
No I never told you
I just held it in
And now I miss everything about you
(still you're gone)
Can't believe that I still want you
(And I'm lovin' you, I never should have walked away)
After all the things we've been through
(I know it's never gonna come again)
I miss everything about you
Without you
