I told her that I loved her,
was not sure if she heard
The roof was pretty windy
and she didn't say a word
Party dying downstairs,
had nothing left to do
Just me,
her and the moon

I said you're on fire babe
then down came the lightning on me
Love can be frightening for sure

All I know at the end of the day
is you want what you want
and you say what you say
And you follow your heart
even though it'll break sometimes
All I know at the end of the day
is you love who you love,
there ain't no other way
If there's something I've learned
from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want
at the end of the day

At the end of the day
You're the one that I want
at the end of the day

She said the night was over,
I said it's forever
20 minutes later,
wound up in the hospital
The priest thinks it's the devil,
my mum thinks it's the flu
But girl it's only you

I said you're on fire babe
then down came the lightning on me
Love can be frightening for sure

All I know at the end of the day
is you want what you want
and you say what you say
And you follow your heart
even though it'll break sometimes
All I know at the end of the day
is you love who you love,
there ain't no other way
If there's something I've learned
from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want
at the end of the day

When the sun goes down I know that you and me and everything will be alright
And when the city's sleeping
You and I can stay awake and keep on dreaming
You and I can stay awake and keep on dreaming

All I know at the end of the day
is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you follow your heart
even though it'll break sometimes
All I know at the end of the day
is you love who you love,
there ain't no other way
If there's something I've learned
from a million mistakes
You're the one that
I want at the end of the day
At the end of the day
You're the one that
I want at the end of the day
You're the one that
I want at the end of the day
