Hello beautiful
How's it going?
I hear it's wonderful
In California
I've been missing you
It's true

But tonight, I'm gonna fly
Yeah tonight, I'm gonna fly
Cause I could go across the world
And see everything and never be satisfied
If I couldn't see those eyes

Hello beautiful
It's been a long time
Since my phone's rung
And you've been on that line
I've been missing you
It's true

But tonight, I'm gonna fly
Yeah tonight, I'm gonna fly, oh yeah
Cause I could go across the world
And see everything and never be satisfied
If I couldn't see those eyes
