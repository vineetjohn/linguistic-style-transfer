He's a stranger to some
And a vision to none
He can never get enough
Get enough of the one

For a fortune, he'd quit
But it's hard to admit
How it ends and begins
On his face is a map of the world
A map of the world
On his face is a map of the world
A map of the world

From yesterday, it's coming
From yesterday, the fear
From yesterday, it calls him
But he doesn't want to read the message here

On a mountain he sits, not of gold but of shit
Through the blood he can look, see the lives that he took
From the council of one
He'll decide when he's done with the innocent

On his face is a map of the world
A map of the world
On his face is a map of the world
A map of the world

From yesterday, it's coming
From yesterday, the fear
From yesterday, it calls him
But he doesn't want to read the message
He doesn't want to read the message
He doesn't want to read the message here

On his face is a map of the world

From yesterday, it's coming
From yesterday, the fear
From yesterday, it calls him
But he doesn't want to read the message here

From yesterday
From yesterday
From yesterday, the fear

From yesterday
From yesterday
But he doesn't want to read the message
He doesn't want to read the message
He doesn't want to read the message here
