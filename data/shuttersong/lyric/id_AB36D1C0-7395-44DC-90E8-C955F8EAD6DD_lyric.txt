Baby, I got love for thee
So deep inside of me
I don't know where to start
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I love you more than anything
But the words can't even touch what's in my heart
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
No, no
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

When I try to explain it I be sounding insane
The words don't ever come out right
I get all tongue-tied and twisted
I can't explain what I'm feeling
And I say, baby, baby,
Oh, woah, oh, woah,
Baby, baby

(Baby I) oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby
(Baby I) oh, baby, baby I
(Baby I) all I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby
But every time I try to say it
Words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby (oh, whoa, oh, whoa)

Baby, I'm so down for you
No matter what you do (real talk), I'll be around
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, baby
See Baby, I been feelin' you
Before I even knew what feelings were about
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,)
Oh, baby
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

When I try to explain it I be sounding all crazy
Words don't ever come out right
I get all tongue-tied and twisted
I can't explain what I'm feeling
And I say Baby, baby (oh, whoa, oh, whoa)
Baby

(Baby I) oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby
(Baby I) oh, baby, baby I
(Baby I) all I'm tryna say is you're my everything (baby)
But every time I try to say it
Words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby (oh, whoa, oh, whoa)
Baby, baby

Straight up you got me
All in, how could I not be,
I sure hope you know (I sure hope you know)
If it's even possible, I love you more
Than the word love can say it (say it)
It's better not explaining
That's why I keep saying...

(Baby I) oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby
(Baby I) oh, baby, baby I
(Baby I) all I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby
But every time I try to say it
Words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby (oh, whoa, oh, whoa)
Baby, baby

(Baby I) oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby
(Baby I) oh, baby, baby I
(Baby I) all I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby
But every time I try to say it
Words, they only complicate it
Every time I try to say it
Words, they only complicate it
Every time I try to say it
Words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby (oh, whoa, oh, whoa)
Baby, baby
