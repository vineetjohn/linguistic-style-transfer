I always knew you were the best
The coolest girl I know
So prettier than all the rest
The star of my show
So many times I wished
You'd be the one for me
But never knew you'd get like this
Girl what you do to me

You're who I'm thinking of
Girl you ain't my runner up
And no matter what you're always number 1

My prize possession
One and only
Adore ya girl I want ya
The one I can't live without
That's you that's you
You're my special little lady

The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known
It's you, it's you
My favorite, my favorite
My favorite, my favorite girl
My favorite girl
You're used to going out your way
To impress these Mr. Wrongs

But you can be yourself with me
I'll take you as you are
I know they said believe in love
Is a dream that can't be real

So girl let's write a fairytale
And show 'em how we feel
You're who I'm thinking of

Girl you ain't my runner up
And no matter what you're always number one
My prize possession

Adore ya girl I want ya
