Let me know that I've done wrong
When I've known this all along
I go around a time or two
Just to waste my time with you

Tell me all that you've thrown away
Find out games you don't wanna play
You are the only one that needs to know

I'll keep you my dirty little secret (dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone
Or you'll be just another regret (just another regret)
My dirty little secret
Who has to know?

When we live such fragile lives
It's the best way we survive
I go around a time or two
Just to waste my time with you
Tell me all that you've thrown away

Find out games you don't wanna play
You are the only one that needs to know
I'll keep you my dirty little secret (dirty little secret)

Don't tell anyone
Or you'll be just another regret (just another regret)
My dirty little secret
Who has to know?
The way she feels inside (inside)

Those thoughts I can't deny (deny)
These sleeping dogs won't lie (won't lie)
And now I tried to but it's eating me apart
Trace this nightmare
I'll keep you my dirty little secret (dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone
Or you'll be just another regret (just another regret)

I'll keep you my dirty little secret (dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone
Or you'll be just another regret (just another regret)
My dirty little secret
My dirty little secret
My dirty little secret
Who has to know?
Who has to know?
