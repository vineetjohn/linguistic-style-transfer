Stand up like a solider baby
Yeah
I know you built like that
Gun it like holster baby

Show dem say you wicked like that
We live where the war is raging
Chasing our crazy dreams
Hoping that the bridge won't cave in

Tonight we let it all go free
Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Mash it up, hot step in a dance

Gimme the ting and make me rock
Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Mash it up, hot step in a dance

Light it up

It's written like your name on a flyer
They wanna tame your desire

But you light it up now your aims getting higher
I dey wait for messiah
But until that day
I'mma rise up high

I put my light in the air
I wanna see everywhere

1 by 1 let me see you
2 by 2 for the sequel
3 by 3 for my people (1, 2, 3, everybody go!)
