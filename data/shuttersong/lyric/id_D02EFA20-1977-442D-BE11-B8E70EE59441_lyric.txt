Withered rope you hang what's empty can't remain to put it simply
In time cry the hollow words to sing with false disguise
Smothered hope fly from sorrow for a new divine tomorrow
I just don't want to know anymore
Life shifts up and down everybody knows it's wrong
Why don't you care?
Life shifts up down wrong
Now do it seem fair?
Life shifts up down wrong
It's not in the rhyme or reason
So it goes with every season crawl to top fall through bottom
First hand love is really rotten
Slice of life find what's plenty inch towards a sanctuary
Light with me inside the womb
I know everyone everybody knows it's me
It's my voice, my voice cries out obscenity
Sightless eye regard my past sometimes it should
I just don't want to know anymore.
Life shifts up and down everybody knows it's wrong
Smothered Hope
