I got this feeling on a summer day when you were gone
I crashed my car into the bridge
I watched I let it burn
I threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs

I crashed my car into the bridge
I don't care
I love it
I don't care

I don't care
I love it
I don't care

You're on a different road
I'm in the milky way
You want me down on earth
But i am up in space
You're so damn hard to please
We gotta kill this switch
You're from the 70s but I'm a 90s chick

I love it
I love it
