Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh, screamin' that's nothin'
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin'

Reppin' my town when you see me
You know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

I put it down from the whip
To my diamonds I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

Black stripe, yellow paint
I hear they scared of it, but them bros ain't
Soon as I hit the club look at them face
Hit the pedal once, make the floor shake

Suede insides, my engine roarin'
It's the big boy, you know what I paid for it
And I got the pedal to the metal
Got you nigga checkin' game, I'm ballin out on every level

Hear them haters talk
But there's nothing you can tell 'em
Just made a million
Got another million on my schedule

No love for em boy I'm breakin' hearts
No keys, push to start

Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh, screamin' that's nothin'
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin'

Reppin' my town when you see me
You know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

I put it down from the whip
To my diamonds I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

Got a call from my jeweler, this just in
And Bitches love me 'cause I'm messin' with their best friends
Not a, but she a freak though
This ain't for one night, I'm shinin' all week, bro

I'm sippin' Cliquot and rockin' yellow diamonds
So many rocks up in my watch I can't tell what the time is
Got a pocketful of big faces
Throw it up 'cause everybody that I'm with tailored

Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh, screamin' that's nothin'
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin'

Reppin' my town when you see me
You know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

I put it down from the whip
To my diamonds I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

Stay high like how I'm supposed to do
That crown underneath them clouds can't get close to you
And my car look unapproachable
Super clean but it's super mean

She wanna rowl with them cats, count stacks
Get fly, take trips and that's that, real rap
I let her get high, she want and she feel that
Convertible drop fill, '87 and the top peel back

Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Yeah, yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
You already know what it is, man
And if you don't, you should by now

Reppin' my town when you see me
You know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip
To my diamonds I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh, screamin' that's nothin'
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin'
Reppin' my town when you see me
You know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip
To my diamonds I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
