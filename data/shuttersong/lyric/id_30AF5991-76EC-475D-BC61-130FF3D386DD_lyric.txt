Where have you been?
Where have you gone?
And have I done
Something wrong?

You're the tooth fairy
You're like Santa Claus
You're like white noise
When I want my favorite song

Just come on back
And come on home
It ain't super smart
To leave me alone

Light a flare
Pick up the phone
I'm like a stoner, babe
Without my bong

Are you hiding in the closet?
Are you underneath the bed?
Did you go for a long walk
Off a short pier?
How come you're not here?

Should I worry you've been bitten?
Or somebody got you high?
Quick, come back
Or I might just die!
How come you're not here?

I've heard some rumors
About another girl
I heard she's cute, but she stores
Nuts like a squirrel

And that's all cool
I'll wait right here
'Til you get bored
And she gets carded for beer

I'm the one
I'm just that slick
You won't find better
I'm honey dipped

There ain't a thing
That's fake on me
I miss you, baby
Come home to me

Are you hiding in the closet?
Are you underneath the bed?
Did you go for a long walk
Off a short pier?
How come you're not here?

Should I worry you've been bitten?
Or somebody got you high?
Quick, come back
Or I might just die!
How come you're not here?

Has anyone seen?
Has anyone seen?
Has anyone seen why
He's hiding from me?
Can anyone see?
Can anyone see?
Can anyone see?
Let's play hide and seek!
Are you hiding in the closet?
Are you underneath the bed?
Did you go for a long walk
Off a short pier?
How come you're not here?
Should I worry you've been bitten?
Or somebody got you high?
Quick, come back
Or I might just die!
Quick, come back
Or I might just die!
