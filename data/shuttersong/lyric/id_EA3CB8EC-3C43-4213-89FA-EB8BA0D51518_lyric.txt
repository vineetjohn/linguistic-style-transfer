No Pressure - Justin Bieber /Big Sean
Written by£ºJustin Bieber|Jason Boyd|Dominic Jordan|Jimmy Giannos|Sean Anderson
You ain't gotta answer none of my calls
I'm believing you'll pick up one day
I don't wanna add to your pain at all
I'm praying that time makes a change in your life
I'm realizing how much you made a change in my life
And I don't wanna spend it with nobody else
Hear me don't nobody deserve myself
Oh no baby what I'm saying is
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now don't rush no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Calm down don't rush no pressure
Thought that you were in it for the paper
Never thought I'd take you serious
Now I need you not a moment later
Losin' it I'm so delirious
And I'm a put up a fight for it
Never give up a love like this
Finally I found someone
That can do me like no other
Talking to my conscience
I made a few mistakes
I did it to myself
I'm the only one to blame
I know you need a little while to believe again
To love again
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now don't rush no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I'll be waiting for you
Don't rush no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now don't rush no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I'll still
Don't rush no pressure
Put my key in the ignition
Don't rush it girl just stretch it out for me
I know that you ain't got no plans to leave
Girl I need your attention
And every time I see you make that face
I wanna love you all over the place
Don't do it baby
Don't do it to me no no
I know you don't wanna talk right
We've been on and off like the cross lights
You heard I'm playin' with them hoes like I golf right
When I touch you I get frostbite
Girl you're so cold so cold so cold
How we so young but livin' so old
In the bed together but we sleepin' solo
That could drive you loco
You supposed to me my uno Yoko ono
Oh no round two again
We've been fighting more than Ryukyu and ken
Last time we argued eight straight days
I learned my lesson I got straight as
And I know it's deeper than masseuses
Oh you know I eat the cookie like I'm luscious
Go ahead and take the time
But it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine
Think about it
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now don't rush no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I'll be waiting for you
Don't rush no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now don't rush no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I'll still
Don't rush no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I know I did you wrong
Let your heart heal
Don't rush no pressure
