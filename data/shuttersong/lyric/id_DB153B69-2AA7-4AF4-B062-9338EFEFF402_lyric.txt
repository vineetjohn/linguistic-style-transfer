"Pressure"

You've seen so many faces that I've never seen before
I left an unrewarding message telling you to come on
Over dramatic, automatically assume I'll stay the same

There's a change in pressure
We're never gonna lie to you
(Change in pressure)
My broken veins say that if my heart stops beating
(Change in pressure)
We'll bleed the same way
(Change in pressure)
Oh, my broken veins say

Well I stay tuned and listen to the news and try to fall asleep at night
Because I'm living in a house with just three walls
So I'm always getting recognized

There's a change in pressure
We're never gonna lie to you
(Change in pressure)
My broken veins say that if my heart stops beating
(Change in pressure)
We'll bleed the same way
(Change in pressure)
Oh, my broken veins say

Change in pressure
Change in pressure
Change in pressure
Change in pressure

There's a change in pressure
We're never gonna lie to you
(Change in pressure)
My broken veins say that if my heart stops beating
(Change in pressure)
We'll bleed the same way
(Change in pressure) 
Oh, my broken veins say
