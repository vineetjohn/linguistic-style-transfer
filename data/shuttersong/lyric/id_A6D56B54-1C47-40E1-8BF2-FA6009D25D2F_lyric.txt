Somebody come to the floor, it feels like we've met before.

Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper.
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper.
Somebody come tip her, she's dancin' like a stripper.

Somebody come get her, she's fillin' all the liquor.

Chopped and screwed up.
I'm a pothead, true enough.
At your ex's crib and you're boo'd up.
Take it slow baby, we in no rush.
Hennessy
or Don Q, that's a very hard choice.
For the diamonds on my pinky, need a gang of cool points.
And the drop head make 'em drop dead, yeah.
Ye ain't scared, ye ain't scared, ye ain't scared, yeah.
Believe me, I'm out here, you see me, in action

I've heard a lot, a lot about you.
Catchin' round blunts like a hot potato

And you dancin' on the table, gushin' like volcano.
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper.
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper.
Somebody come tip her, she's dancin' like a stripper.
Somebody come get her, she's fillin' all the liquor.
You got girls in here? I'm recruitin'.
And they fine, hop the line.
I've been sippin' on Patrón and wine.
I'm just tryna have a good fuckin' time.

I was chillin' with the open container.
Grabbed her arm, told her not to be a stranger.
I was blowing on the dank with my niggas.

I was lookin' for the girls who willin'.
Baby girl, if you fuck with me then we gettin' bands.
If you smokin' with me then we on dank.
I don't fuck with local hoes, I told you that.
How you movin', you deserve a couple racks.
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper.
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper.
Somebody come tip her, she's dancin' like a stripper.

Hundreds on your face, baby girl
Come and do that little thing that you was doin'.

It seems like we're fuckin' in this club
Baby girl, what they think that we're doin'?
You gettin' on my nerves with them questions
Girl you know I'm tryna start a little movement.
I ain't got no business fuckin' with you.
Out the blue, you actin' brand new.
Washingtons mean nothing to you.
Same way with us.
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper.
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper.
Somebody come tip her, she's dancin' like a stripper.
Somebody come get her, she's fillin' all the liquor.
