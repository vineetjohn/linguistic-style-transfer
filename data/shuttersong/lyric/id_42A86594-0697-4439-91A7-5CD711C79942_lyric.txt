Counted all my mistakes and there's only one
Standing out from the list of the things I've done
All the rest of my crimes don't come close
To the look on your face when I let you go

So I built you a house from a broken home
And I wrote you a song with the words you spoke
Yeah it took me some time but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down

Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?

Get a taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue
It's at the top of the list of the things I want
Mind is running in circles of you and me
Anyone in between is the enemy

Shadows come with the pain that you're running from
Love was something you've never heard enough
Yeah it took me some time but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down

Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?

Are you sleeping, baby, by yourself?
Or are you giving it to someone else?
Try to find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?

Tell me now, tell me now, tell me where you go when you feel afraid?
(Where do broken hearts go?)
Tell me now, tell me now, tell me will you ever love me again, love me again?

Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?

Are you sleeping, baby, by yourself?
Or are you giving it to someone else?
Try to find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?

Tell me where you're hiding out
Where do broken hearts go?
Come on baby, cause I need you now
Where do broken hearts go?
Tell me, cause I'm 10 feet down
Where do broken hearts go?
Come on baby, come and get me out
Come on baby, come and get me out
Come on baby, cause I need you now
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?
