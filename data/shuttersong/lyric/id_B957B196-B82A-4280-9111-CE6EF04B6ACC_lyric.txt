Race
Life's a race
And I'm gonna win
Yes, I'm gonna win

And I'll light the fuse
And I'll never lose
And I choose to survive
Whatever it takes
You won't pull ahead
I'll keep up the pace

And I'll reveal my strength
To the whole human race
Yes, I am prepared
To stay alive
And I won't forgive
The vengeance is mine

And I won't give in
Because I choose to thrive
Yeah, I'm gonna win

And I'll never lose
And I choose to survive

Whatever it takes
You won't pull ahead
'Cause I'll keep up the pace

And I'll reveal my strength
To the whole human race
