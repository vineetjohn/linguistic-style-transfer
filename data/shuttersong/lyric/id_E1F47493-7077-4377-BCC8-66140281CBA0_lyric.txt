You Are My One Thing - Bethel Music
Your voice ever close you called me
You never gave up pursuing
I fell in love you stole my heart
Your hand ever near I hold to
I long for your heart to know you
Just to live in your fellowship
Just to be close to you
Just to walk next to you
This is my one thing
You are my one thing
Just to be close to you
Just to walk next to you
This is my one thing
You are my one thing
My eyes ever fixed upon you
To live like a child to trust you
I'll hold on to this treasured love
My life ever set at your feet
I give you my heart completely
To live this life always by your side
Just to be close to you
Just to walk next to you
This is my one thing
You are my one thing
Just to be close to you
Just to walk next to you
This is my one thing
You are my one thing
I have to know you
All that's within me
Cries out for your presence  God
Nothing compares
There's no one else
Jesus you're my one desire
Nothing compares
There's no one else
Jesus you're my one desire
Jesus you're my one desire
Just to be close to you
Just to walk next to you
This is my one thing
You are my one thing
Just to be close to you
Just to walk next to you
This is my one thing
You are my one thing
