I came here tonight to get you out of my mind
I'm gonna take what I find (uh oh, yeah!)
...
So open the box, don't need no key I'm unlocked

And I won't tell you to stop (uh oh, yeah!)
Hey boy!
I don't need to know where you've been
All I need to know is you and no need for talking
...
Hey boy!
So don't even tell me your name

All I need to know is whose place
And let's get walking...
All I wanna do is love your body
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh

Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
...
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh
All I wanna do is love your body

...
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
...
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh

It's true what you heard, I am a freak, I'm disturbed
So come on and give me your worst (uh oh, yeah)
We're moving faster than slow
If you don't know where to go
I'll finish off on my own (uh oh, yeah)
Hey boy!
I don't need to know where you've been
All I need to know is you and no need for talking

...
Hey boy!
So don't even tell me your name
All I need to know is whose place

And let's get walking...
Say say hey...
All I wanna do is love your body
...

Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it

Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh

All I wanna do is love your body
...
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh
...
I think you already know my name
...
I think you already know my name
...
Hey hey, Ha!, Alright, Say
...
I think you already know my name
...
All I wanna do is love your body
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh, (say)
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh
All I wanna do is love your body
...
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh
(Say, say, hey)
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
...
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh
