When I get chills at night
I feel it deep inside without you, yeah
Know how to satisfy
Keeping that tempo right without you, yeah

Pictures in my mind on replay
I'm gonna touch the pain away
I know how to scream my own name

Scream my name

I love me!
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
(Hey)
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
I love me!
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Anytime, day or night

Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else

Anytime that I like
I love me!
I'll take it nice and slow
Feeling good on my own without you, yeah

Got me speaking in tongues
The beautiful, it comes without you, yeah

I'm gonna put my body first

And love me so hard 'til it hurts
I know how to scream out the words
Scream the words
I love me!
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
(Hey)
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
