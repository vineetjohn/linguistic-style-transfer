Should old acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should old acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne?

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne, for auld lang syne

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

Old acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should old acquaintance be forgot
Eh, eh, auld lang syne?

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne

Eh, oh, yeah, aye
Eh, hey, Happy New Yeah, baby
Aye, oh, 5, 4, 3, 2!

Should old acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should old acquaintance be forgot?
Eh, eh, auld land syne

Does anybody really know the words?
Might as well sing along

Happy New Year, baby, oh
Happy New Year, baby

Should old acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should old acquaintance be forgot
Eh, eh, auld land syne?

Happy New Year to you and your friends
And have a great party
Happy New Year to you too
And have a great party
