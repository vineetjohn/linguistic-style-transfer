If time was still
The sun would never, never find us
We could light up
The sky tonight
I could see the world through your eyes
Leave it all behind

If it's you and me forever
If it's you and me right now
I'd be alright
Be alright
If we chase the stars to lose our shadow
Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
So won't you fly with me

Oh yeah
Gotta fly with me now

Now, the past
Has come alive
And I've been given meaning
And a reason
To give all I can
To believe, once again

If it's you and me forever
If it's you and me right now
I'd be alright
Be alright
If we chase the stars to lose our shadow
Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
So won't you fly with me

Maybe you were just afraid
Knowing you were miles away
From the place where you needed to be
And that's right here with me

If it's you and me forever
You and me right now
I'd be alright

If it's you and me forever
If it's you and me right now
I'd be alright
Be alright
If we chase the stars to lose our shadow
Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
So won't you fly, fly, fly with me
