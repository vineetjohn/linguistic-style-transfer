5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Were counting down
Down
Get ready!

From this moment on
The future is now, now...

Get ready!
Lifting off like spaceships in the night!
We're out of sight!
Brighter than the sun

We counting down
Everybody move to the beat of your heart!
Dancing through infinity, beyond the stars!
There's no looking back, 'cause here we come!

The future sounds, oh, the future sounds like us!
We're taking off at the speed of light!
Blowing through your speakers from the satellites!
What you're gonna hear is not what it was!

The future sounds, oh, the future sounds like us!
Can you hear the rush?
We taking over, o-o-over, yeah
Futuristic drums

Are blasting louder, louder, yeah
Shooting through the sky, flashes of light
We're out of sight, yeah!
Year three thousand twelve

We coming for ya', oh yeah!
Everybody move to the beat of your heart!
Dancing through infinity, beyond the stars!
There's no looking back, 'cause here we come!

The future sounds, oh, the future sounds like us!
We're taking off at the speed of light!
Blowing through your speakers from the satellites!
What you're gonna hear is not what it was!

The future sounds, oh, the future sounds like us!
were counting down, down...
The future is nooooooooooooooooooow

Woo!
Everybody move to the beat of your heart! (Oh, yeah)
Dancing through infinity, beyond the stars!
There's no looking back, 'cause here we come! (Here we come!)
The future sounds, oh, the future sounds like us!
We're taking off at the speed of light!
Blowing through your speakers from the satellites! (Here we come...)
What you're gonna hear is not what it was! (Not what it was)
The future sounds, oh, the future sounds like us!
Can you hear the rush?
We taking over, over, over...
