I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good
Living life just like I should
Wouldn't change it if I could
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good

Trying to figure out who I am
Or who I'm supposed to be
Feel good about where I stand
So I can make the most of me-I'm
Coming back down from space
A million miles away
There's a lot of love in this place
(Oh) And I'm just trying to say

I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good
Living life just like I should
Wouldn't change it if I could
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good
Living life just like I should
Wouldn't change it if I could
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good

It's been a long time living this way
Worrying what people say
Feeling like I won't fit in
But I won't give up, no I won't give in
We're looking for something more
What you're really looking for
It's been with you since you were born
Since you were born

I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good
Living life just like I should
Wouldn't change it if I could
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good
Living life just like I should
Wouldn't change it if I could
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good

You only live once
I'm good with myself
I'm there for my friends
Til the very end
You only live once
I'm good with myself
I'm there for my friends
Til the very end

I wanna see another love revolution
Find a way to be a better person
If we come together like we should
We could all be good

I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good
Living life just like I should
Wouldn't change it if I could
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good
Living life just like I should
Wouldn't change it if I could
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good
Living life just like I should
Wouldn't change it if I could
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good
