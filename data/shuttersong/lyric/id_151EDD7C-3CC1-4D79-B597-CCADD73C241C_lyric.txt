Well she was just seventeen
You know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare

So how could I dance with another
Oh!
When I saw her standing there
Well she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long

I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another
Woo!

When I saw her standing there
Well my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand

In mine
Well, we danced through the night

And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her

Now I'll never dance with another
Woo!
Since I saw her standing there
Ahh!
Ah, ah, ah

Whoa, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well since I saw her standing there
