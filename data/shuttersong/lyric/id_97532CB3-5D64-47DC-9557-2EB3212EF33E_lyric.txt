Took a ride
to the end of the line. Where
no one ever goes.
Ended up
on a broken train with nobody I know.
But the pain
and the longing's the same.
Where the dying
Now I'm lost
and I'm screaming for help.

Relax,
take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do.
Relax,
take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you.

It's as if I'm scared.
It's as if I'm terrified.
It's as if I scared.
It's as if I'm playing with fire.
Scared.
It's as if I'm terrified.
Are you scared?
Are we playing with fire?

Relax
There is an answer
to the darkest times.
It's clear
we don't understand but the last thing on my mind
Is to leave you.
I believe that we're in this together.
Don't scream
there are so many roads left.

Blame it on me or blame it on you.

It's as if I'm scared.
It's as if I'm terrified.
It's as if I scared.
It's as if I'm playing with fire.
Relax
It's as if I'm terrified.
Are you scared?
Are we playing with fire?
Relax
