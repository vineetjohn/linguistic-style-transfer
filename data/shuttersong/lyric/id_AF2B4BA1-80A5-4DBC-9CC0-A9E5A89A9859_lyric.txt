I had a dream the other night
Bout how we only get one night
Woke me up right after 2
Stayed awake and stared at you
So I wouldn't lose my mind
And I had the week that came from hell
And yes I know that you could tell
But you're like the net under the ledge
Whether I go flying off the edge
You go flying off as well
And if you only die once
I wanna die with
You got something I need
In this world full of people  there's one killing me
And if we only die once  I wanna die with you
You got something I need
In this world full of people  there's one killing me
And if we only die once  I wanna die with you
Last night I think I drank too much  yeah
Call it our temporary crunch
With broken words I've tried to say
Honey don't you be afraid
If we got nothing  we got us  yeah
And if you only die once
I wanna die with
You got something I need
In this world full of people  there's one killing me
And if we only die once  I wanna die with you
You got something I need
In this world full of people  there's one killing me
And if we only die once  I wanna die with you
I know that we're not the same
But I'm so damn glad that we made it
To this time  this time  around  yeah
You got something I need
In this world full of people  there's one killing me
And if we only die once  I wanna die with you
You got something I need
In this world full of people  there's one killing me
And if we only die once  I wanna die with you
You got something I need
In this world full of people  there's one killing me
And if we only die once  I wanna die with you
And if we only die once  I wanna die
If we only live once  I wanna live with you
