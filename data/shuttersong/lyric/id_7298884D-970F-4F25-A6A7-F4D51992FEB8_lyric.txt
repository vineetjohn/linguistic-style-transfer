In the clouds where the angels sing
In your eyes, where I wanna be
And her smile is all I see
She knows I need her loving
She knows I need her touching
She plays with my heart and emotion
I give her my love and devotion
She gave me her thought and a notion
I need her body
Needs me too

I need somebody to
Love me blue

I've been doing it wrong for too long
I said I've been at it wrong for too long
I've been doing it wrong for too long

In the clouds where the angels sing
It's her smile, yeah it's so glassy
In her eyes, where I wanna be
She knows I need her loving
She knows I need her touching
She plays with my heart and emotion
I give her my love and devotion
She gave me her thought and a notion
I need her body
She needs me too

I need somebody to love
Love me blue
Love me blue
Love me blue
Love me blue
