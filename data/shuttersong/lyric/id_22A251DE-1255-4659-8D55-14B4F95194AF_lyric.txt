There's nothing I want
But money and time
Million dollar bills
And the tick tick tick tick
There's nothing more cruel
Than only nine lives
A limited spice

Would do the trick trick trick trick
We could leave the house

Leave the party
Let the people know
Go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cards go
There's nothing as fun

As coming untied
And running with the kids
In the park park park park
There's nothing that's hurt

Like letting you go
A tiger-burn eyes
In the dark dark dark dark
We could leave the house
Leave the party
Let the people know
Go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cards go
It's not about just being out but knowing our people
'Cause we can get in trouble just by going free throw
And now I'm letting you know 4x
