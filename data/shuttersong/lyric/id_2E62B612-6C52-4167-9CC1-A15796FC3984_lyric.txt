I heard you sold the Amazon
To show the country that you're from
Is where the world should want to be
For a fine something all people need
I'm faithless now
Though we win every time and I don't know how
'Cause I haven't bought you and I haven't sold me

But the people are dying to get on TV
I heard he lives down a river somewhere
With six cars and a grizzly bear
He's got eyes, but he can't see

Well he talks like an angel, but he looks like me
Oh, Lord!
What have I become?
I'm the face of God, I'm my father's son
I'm not what you think you see
I know you can't eat leather, but you can't stop me
Why would you lie, why would you lie about how you feel?
I've got a mission and my mission is real
Because you've had your chances, yeah you've had enough
I'm gonna burn your house down to spread peace and love
And it gets me down

Oh, Lord, how it gets me down
I heard he lives down a river somewhere
With six cars and a grizzly bear
He's got eyes, but he can't see
Well he talks like an angel, but he looks like me

Oh, Lord!
I wanna play the beautiful game while I'm in Brazil
'Cause everybody plays the beautiful game out in Brazil
And it's all you've ever wanted, and it's all that you want still
Don't you wanna play the beautiful game out in Brazil?
I wanna play the beautiful game while I'm in Brazil
'Cause everybody plays the beautiful game out in Brazil
And it's all you've ever wanted, and it's all that you want still

Don't you wanna play the beautiful game out in Brazil?
(OOOH YEAH)
I heard he lives down a river somewhere
With six cars and a grizzly bear
He's got eyes, but he can't see
Well he talks like an angel, but he looks like me
I heard he lives down a river somewhere
With six cars and a grizzly bear
He's got eyes, but he can't see
Well he talks like an angel, but he looks like me
(AND THAT WAS MY TRIPLE COLLATERAL IN FREE FOR ALL)
