I've been up in the air
Out of my head
Stuck in a moment of emotion
I destroyed

Is this the end I feel?
Up in the air
Fucked up on life
All of the laws I've broken
Loves that I've sacrificed
Is this the end?

End?

End?
End?
I'll wrap my hands around your neck

So tight with love, love
A thousand times I tempted fate

A thousand times I played this game
A thousand times that I have said
Today, today, today
I've been up in the air

Lost in the night
I wouldn't trade an eye for your lies
Your lust for my life

Is this the end?

You were the love of my life
Darkness the light
This is a portrait of a tortured you and I
Is this the

Is this the

Is this the end?
I'll wrap my hands around your neck
So tight with love, love, love
A thousand times I tempted fate

A thousand times I played this game
A thousand times that I have said

Today, today, today

A thousand times I tempted fate
A thousand times I played this game
A thousand times that I have said
Today, today, today

I've been up in the air
Is this the end I feel?

Up in the air
Chasing a dream so real
I've been up in the air
(I'll wrap my hands around your neck, neck)

Is this the end I feel?
Up in the air
Chasing a dream
Chasing a dream

Take no more

Take no more
Take no more
I'll take no more
A thousand times I tempted fate
(I'll take no more)
A thousand times I played this game
(I'll take no more)
A thousand times that I have said
(I'll take no more)
Today, today, today
Today, today, today, today
(I'll wrap my hands around your neck, neck with love, love)
Today, today, today, today
(I'll wrap my hands around your neck, neck with love, love)
I'll wrap my hands around your neck
Neck, neck, neck, neck, neck, neck, neck
I'll wrap my hands around your neck
So tight with love, love
