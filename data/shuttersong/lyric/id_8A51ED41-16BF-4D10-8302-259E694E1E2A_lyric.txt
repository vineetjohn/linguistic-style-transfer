She leads a lonely life

She leads a lonely life
When she woke up late in the morning light
And the day had just begun
She opened up her eyes and thought
Oh what a morning
It's not a day for work

It's a day for catching tan
Just laying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get you

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow
Boy all that she wants is another baby yeah

All that she wants is another baby

She's gone tomorrow

Boy all that she wants is another baby yeah
(All that she wants)
(All that she wants)
So if you are in sight and the day is right

She's a hunter, you're the fox
The gentle voice that talks to you
Won't talk forever

It is a night for passion
But the morning means goodbye
Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
She's going to get you

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow
Boy all that she wants is another baby yeah
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow
Boy all that she wants is another baby yeah
Another baby yeah
Ohhh
Ohhh
All that she wants is another baby (Another baby yeah)
she's gone tomorrow
Boy all that she wants is another baby (Another baby yeah)
All that she wants is another baby (Another baby yeah)
She's gone tomorrow
Boy all that she wants is another baby (Another baby yeah)
All that she wants
All that she wants
