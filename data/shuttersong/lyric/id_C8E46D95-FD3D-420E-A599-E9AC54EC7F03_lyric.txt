Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I won't let the night stand in my way
I know what I want, I know what I get, yeah
I'm only here to find you, you
All I need is you by my side
All I wanna do is lay down next to you

'Cause all I need is one love, one love, one heart
'Cause all I need is one love, one love, one heart
Baby give it to me
'Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody has got what I need
'Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody has got what I need tonight

See I've made mistakes time after time, time, time
But no not today, won't leave 'til I find what I'm looking for
I'm only here to find you, you
All I need is you by my side
All I wanna do is dance under the moon

'Cause all I need is one love, one love, one heart
'Cause all I need is one love, one love, one heart
Baby give it to me
'Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody has got what I need
'Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody has got what I need tonight

Your love is like a roller-coaster
The way that you take my breath away
It feels like I'm slowly falling deeper and deeper, deeper and deeper

'Cause all I need is one love, one love, one heart
'Cause all I need is one love, one love, one heart
Baby give it to me
'Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody has got what I need
'Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody can give it to me
'Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody has got what I need
'Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody has got what I need tonight.
