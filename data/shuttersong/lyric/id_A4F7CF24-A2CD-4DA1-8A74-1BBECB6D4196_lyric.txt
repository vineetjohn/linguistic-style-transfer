Keep your clever lines
Hold your easy rhymes
Silence everything
Silence always wins

It's a perfect alibi
There's no need to analyze
It will be all right
Through the longest night
Just silence everything

But we could live by the foot of the mountain
We could clear us a yard in the back
Build a home by the foot of the mountain
We could stay there and never come back

Learn from my mistake
Leave what others take
Speak when spoken to
And do what others do

Silence always wins
So silence everything
It will be all right
In the morning light
Just silence everything

But we could live by the foot of the mountain
We could clear us a yard in the back
Build a home by the foot of the mountain
We could stay there and never come back
We could stay there and never come back

You know it
We could leave tonight
But we could live by the foot of the mountain
We could make us a white picket fence
Build a home by the foot of the mountain
We could stay there and see how it ends
Yes, we could stay there and see how it ends
We could stay there and see how it ends
