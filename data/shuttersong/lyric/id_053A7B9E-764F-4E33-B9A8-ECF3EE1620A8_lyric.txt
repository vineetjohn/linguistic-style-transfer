In the car, I just can't wait
To pick you up on our very first date
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?
Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm just scared of what you think
You make me nervous so I really can't eat

Let's go
Don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest
Let's make
This night last forever
Forever, and ever, let's make this last forever

Forever, and ever, let's make this last forever

When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies

I dreamt the thought of our very first kiss
A target that I'm probably gonna' miss

Let's go
Don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest
Let's make

This night last forever
Forever, and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever, and ever, let's make this last forever

Let's go
Don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest
Let's make
This night last forever
Forever, and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever, and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever, and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever, and ever, let's make this last forever
