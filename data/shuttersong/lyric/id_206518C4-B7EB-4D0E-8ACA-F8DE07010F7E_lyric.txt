Well, I've always been such a stubborn man and it's made me regret.
Each time I thought I found love it left...
It only takes a second, just a moment to wait

But it's hard enough, just to find someone, you can be yourself with
Guess what I'm trying to tell you is
Please don't be so quick to go, oh come back and stay

And what I say is, that I'm just trying to do the right thing
To be a better man
And I don't wanna keep on hurting you, all over and over again
I've had enough of old mistakes now,
I'm gonna tell you to your face now
I'm just trying to do my best
To be a better man

Now when the music stops and the lights go out, will you still be here?
Come rest your head on my shoulder, dear
It only takes a second, just a moment to wait

Now I've been afraid, but that's no excuse for all this heartbreak
Some say you lay in the bed you make
Don't let me lie here alone baby, oh come back today

Cause what I say is, that I'm just trying to do the right thing
To be a better man
And I don't wanna keep on hurting you, all over and over again
I've had enough of old mistakes now,
I'm gonna tell you to your face now
I'm just trying to do my best
To be a better man, oh

But what else can I do
To make it up to you?

Ooh, I'm just trying to do the right thing
To be a better man
And I don't wanna keep on hurting you, all over and over and over
I've had enough of old mistakes now,
I'm gonna tell you to your face now
I'm just trying to do my best
To be a better man

All over and over and over
I've had enough of old mistakes now,
I'm gonna tell you to your face now
I'm just trying to do my best
To be a better man
