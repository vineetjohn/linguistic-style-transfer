Dum-da-de-da
Do, do, do, do, do, do
(Coming down, dripping candy on the ground)

It's that Yoncé, your Yoncé in that lingerie
On that chardonnay, scoring touchdowns on yo runway
I'm Texas forever like Bun B, and I'm redboned yo
Billion Ring like Donjae, I'm camo in here yo
These thots can't clock me nowadays
You wish I was your pound cake
Boy you know I look good as fuck
You wish I was your babymomma
Want me to come around and give you good karma, but no
We escalate, up in this bitch like elevators
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
(Ha, ha, God damn, God damn, God damn)

Momma taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine (I'm flawless!)

You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ridin' round in it, flawless
Flossin' on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless
My diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless
My Roc, flawless
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn, God damn

I wake up looking this good
And I wouldn't change it if I could
(If I could, if I, if I, could)
And you can say what you want
I'm the shit (what you want I'm the shit)
I'm the shit, I'm the shit, I'm the shit
I want everyone to feel like this, tonight
God damn, God damn, God damn
