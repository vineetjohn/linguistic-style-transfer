Oh man, oh man, oh man

Not again
Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley
You can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Whoa, very important and very pretentious
When I look back I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left a boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all to think that I don't write enough
They just mad cause I got the midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wife-in niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one
I got the drink in me goin' back to back
Yeah, goin' back to back
I got the drink in me goin' back to back
Yeah, I'm goin' back to back
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell 'em that they better as friends
Not even when you sayin', "Drizzy, tell 'em again"
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell  out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave  me every reason
The point I'm tryna  make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame or what you'd do for freedom
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near  me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop  me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's  my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga
