Harry: Don't try to make me stay
Or ask if I'm okay
I don't have the answer
Don't make me stay the night
Or ask if I'm alright
I don't have the answer

Liam: Heartache doesn't last forever
I'll say I'm fine
Midnight ain't no time for laughing
When you say goodbye

Zayn: It makes your lips so kissable
And your kiss unmissable
Your fingertips so touchable
And your eyes irresistible
Niall: I've tried to ask myself

Should I see someone else?
I wish I knew the answer
But I know, if I go now, if I leave
Then I'm on my own tonight
I'll never know the answer
Liam: Midnight doesn't last forever
Dark turns to light
Heartache flips my world around

I'm falling down, down, down
That's why
Zayn: I find your lips so kissable
And your kiss unmissable
Your fingertips so touchable

And your eyes irresistible
All: Irresistible
Irresistible
Irresistible
Irresistible

Harry: It's in your lips and in your kiss
It's in your touch and your fingertips
And it's in all the things and other things
That make you who you are and your eyes irresistible
All: It makes your lips so kissable
And your kiss invincible
Louis: Your fingertips so touchable
Harry: And your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
Zayn: Irresistible
