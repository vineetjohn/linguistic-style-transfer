 I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing  I need
 I  don 't care about presents
Underneath the  Christmas tree
 I just  want you  for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true...
All  I  want  for  Christmas
Is you...
 I  don 't  want  a  lot  for  Christmas
There is just one thing  I need
 I  don 't care about presents
Underneath the  Christmas tree
 I  don 't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won 't make me happy
With  a toy on  Christmas Day
 I just  want you  for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All  I  want  for  Christmas is you...
You baby
 I won 't ask  for much this  Christmas
 I won 't even wish  for snow
 I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
 I won 't make  a list and send it
To the North Pole  for Saint Nick
 I won 't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause  I just  want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can  I  do
Baby all  I  want  for  Christmas is you
You...
All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
 I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won 't you bring me the one  I really need - won 't you please bring my
baby to me
Oh  I  don 't  want  a  lot  for  Christmas
This is all  I'm asking  for
 I just  want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh  I just  want him  for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all  I  want  for  Christmas is
You...
Baby, all  I  want  for  Christmas is you
