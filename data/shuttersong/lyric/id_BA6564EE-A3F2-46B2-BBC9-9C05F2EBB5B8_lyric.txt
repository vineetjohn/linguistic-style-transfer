Oh, oh
Oh, oh
From the get-go I knew this was hard to hold
Like a crash the whole thing spun out of control
Oh, on a wire, we were dancing
Two kids, no consequences

Pull the trigger, without thinking
There's only one way down this road
It was like a time bomb set into motion
We knew that we were destined to explode
& if I have to pull you out of the wreckage
You know I'm never gonna let you go
We're like a time bomb
Gonna lose it, let's defuse it
Baby, we're like a time bomb

But I need it
Wouldn't have it any other way
Well there's no way out of this
So let's stay in
Every storm that comes
Also comes to an end
Oh, resistance is useless
Just two kids stupid & fearless

Like a bullet shooting the love-sick
There's only one way down this road
It was like a time bomb set into motion
We knew that we were destined to explode
& if I have to pull you out of the wreckage
You know I'm never gonna let you go
We're like a time bomb
Gonna lose it, let's defuse it
Baby, we're like a time bomb

But I need it
Wouldn't have it any other way
Got my heart in your hands, like a time bomb ticking
It goes off, we start again
When it breaks, we fix it
Got your heart in my hands, like a time bomb ticking

We should know better
But we won't let go
It was like a time bomb set into motion
We knew that we were destined to explode (destined to explode)
& if I have to pull you out of the wreckage
You know I'm never gonna let you let me go
Like a time bomb
Gonna lose it, let's defuse it
Baby we're like a time bomb
But I need it
Wouldn't have it any other way
