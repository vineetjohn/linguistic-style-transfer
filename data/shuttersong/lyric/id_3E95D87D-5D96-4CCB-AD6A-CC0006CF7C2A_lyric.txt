Right when I think I finally got you figured out
You turn around, blow my mind
So frustrated, girl you make me wanna shout
And it's only the start of the night
And I'm like

Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my God
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my God

Why you do me wrong?
Why you do me wrong?
When you wear that dress
Oh my heart just can't take it anymore
Why you do me wrong?
Why you do me wrong?
When you act like this
It's like your momma never taught you how to love
So let me teach ya

Take one step forward then we take a couple back
But you know I'm gonna keep up the pace
This game we're playing make me wanna break the rules
Can't let you get away from me
I'm like

Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my God (oh my God)
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my God (yeah)

Why you do me wrong?
Why you do me wrong?
When you wear that dress
Oh my heart just can't take it anymore
Why you do me wrong?
Why you do me wrong?
When you act like this
It's like your momma never taught you how to love
So let me teach ya

Dance with that body girl
'Cause everybody here is wanting that body girl
Dance with that body girl
'Cause everybody here is wanting that body girl

Why you do me wrong?
Why you do me wrong?
When you wear that dress
Oh my heart just can't take it anymore
Why you do me wrong?
Why you do me wrong?
When you act like this
It's like your momma never taught you how to love

Why you do me wrong?
Why you do me wrong?
When you wear that dress
Oh my heart just can't take it anymore
Why you do me wrong?
