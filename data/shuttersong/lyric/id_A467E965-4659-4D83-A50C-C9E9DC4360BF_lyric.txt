I sleep with the door open, if you want to come in, while I'm sleeping
I'm always sleeping naked, 'cause you wake up, and you're creeping
Want to lick it so much, it's almost like I taste it on the tip of my tongue
I want to touch it so bad, it's almost like I can feel it on my fingertips
I want yours inside of me, but don't forget where I like licking, babe
I want to make your fantasies, reality, I want to be yours, baby

I want you to bang
My box
I want you to bang
My box

There ain't nothing that I'm scared to try
I can be on top or if you like it, I'll just lie here
Take my picture, position my body
Wherever you like, just know that I like it naughty
Teach me a lesson, pretend we never met
But we can't keep just kissing, 'cause you're getting me so wet
The only downside to this morning, is you're getting up and you're leaving
When I'm dreaming, and you're in 'em
I wake myself up, and I'm screaming

Oh, what are you doing to me?
It's like you're a zookeeper setting animals free
You release me, like a tiger that's been locked in a cage

Here I am
Here you are
I want it so hard
You finger my heart
I know just what I need
What I came here to do
I've been thinking, babe
Been mostly about you

I want you to bang
My box
I want you to bang
My box
You say it tastes like cake, with my lips against your face
Want you to eat it, babe.
