Standing on the world outside,
Caught up in a love landslide,
Stuck still, colour blind,
Hoping for a black and white.

Are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna be mine?
I feel it falling from the skies above,
Are you gonna be mine?

My wave, my shark, my demon in the dark,
The blue tide pulling me under,
Or are you my soul, my heart, pull everything apart?

Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?

Walking on the clouds unknown,
Drop down oh I will never go, never go, never go,
Floating like gravity has grown
Reach down to a deep deep hole, deep hole, deep deep hole.

Are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna be mine?
I feel it falling from the skies above,
Are you gonna be mine?

My wave, my shark, my demon in the dark,
The blue tide pulling me under,
Or are you my soul, my heart, pull everything apart?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?

Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?

Standing on the world outside
I'm a shark in a love landslide
