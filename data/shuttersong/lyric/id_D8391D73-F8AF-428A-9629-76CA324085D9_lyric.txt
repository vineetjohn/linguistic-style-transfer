I ask this guy is he ready to fight and
I take him to the park
I ask you girl are you ready to fight and
You put your dukes up, baby put your dukes up
Toe to toe with you, losing control with you
Wanna know would you rip me to pieces
Toe to toe with you, losing control when you give me the eye
So get it all over, get it on me
I just wanna see
It running all over, running on you
I just want you to…
Girl take off that jewelry
You're gonna make a mark
Take your time rolling up your sleeves
And coming at me, coming for me
Down and out again, down for the count again
First round, you rip me to pieces
Down and out again, down for the count when you give me the eye
So get it all over, get it on me
I just wanna see
It running all over, running on you
I just want you to...
Get it all over, get it on me
I just wanna see
It running all over, running on you
I just want you to...
Make a mess of me again
Just make a mess of me again
I'm inside out, I'm off the ground
You got me going kinda mental
But I'm into it, so I submit to you
So get it all over, get it on me
I just wanna see…
It running all over, running on you
I just want you to...
To get it all over, get it on me
I just wanna see
It running all over, running on you
I just want you to
Make a mess of me again
Just make a mess of me again
