Can hold my breath only for a little while
'Til reality starts sinking in
Once again i'm settling for second best
Turn the pages and skip to the end
To where I swore that I would try
Since the last time I crossed that line
In the back of my mind I know
It only hurts when your eyes are open
Lies get tossed and truth is spoken
It only hurts when that door gets open
Dreams are lost and hearts are broken
Miles away promise from a burning bed
Two worlds should never collide
One word would end it if you ever heard
Tear the page out that reminds me
When I swore that I'd be strong
Now the next time has come and gone
Well maybe I'm wrong I know
It only hurts when your eyes are open
Lies get tossed and truth is spoken
It only hurts when that door gets open
Dreams are lost and hearts are broken
I know what your feeling
It's hard to believe in someone,
Someone who's not there
I know that your waiting
'Cause love is worth saving
But only for so long, so long, so long
I swore that I would try since the last time, the last time
It only hurts when your eyes are open
Lies get tossed and Truth is spoken
It only hurts when that door
Gets open dreams are lost and hearts are broken
It only hurts when your eyes are open
Lies get tossed and truth is spoken
It only hurts when that door gets open
Dreams are lost and hearts are broken
