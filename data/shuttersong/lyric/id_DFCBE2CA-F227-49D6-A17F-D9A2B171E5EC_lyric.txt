Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song they're playin' on the radio
Let's sway
While colour lights up your face
Let's sway
Sway through the crowd to an empty space

If you say run
I'll run with you
And if you say hide
We'll hide

Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms
And tremble like a flower

Let's dance

Let's dance

For fear your grace should fall

Let's dance

For fear tonight is all

Let's sway

You could look into my eyes

Let's sway

Under the moonlight, this serious moonlight

And if you say run
I'll run with you
And if you say hide
We'll hide

Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms
And tremble like a flower

Let's dance

Put on your red shoes and dance the blues

Let's sway

Under the moonlight, this serious moonlight

Let's sway
Let's sway
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's...
