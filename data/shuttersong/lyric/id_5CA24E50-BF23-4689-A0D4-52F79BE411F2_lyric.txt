Help me polarize
Help me polarize
Help me down
Those stairs is where I'll be hiding all my problems
Help me polarize
Help me polarize

Help me out
My friends and I we've got a lot of problems
You know where I'm coming from
Though I am running to you
All I feel is deny, deny, denial
I wanted to be a better brother, better son
Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done

I have none to show to the one I love
But deny, deny, denial
Help me polarize
Help me polarize
Help me down
Those stairs is where I'll be hiding all my problems

Help me polarize
Help me polarize
Help me out
My friends and I, we've got a lot of problems

Polarize is taking your disguises
Separating them, splitting them up from wrong and right
It's deciding where to die and deciding where to fight
Deny, deny, denial

I wanted to be a better brother, better son
Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done
I have none to show to the one I love
But deny, deny, denial

My friends and I, we've got a lot of problems
We have problems

We have problems
Domingo en fuego
I think I lost my halo

I don't know where you are
You'll have to come and find me, find me
