Mad world beats
Outside our hearts
Times of need
We are apart

Under stars
We are alone

Under stars

Knuckles move under his skin
He wraps his heart and drives it in
And they move it all around
Until we cries

Under stars
Under stars

Mother cries and turns around
Walks outside without a sound
The rain against the skin
While she faces every sin

Under stars
Under stars

They have only fallen asleep
They have only fallen asleep
They have only fallen asleep
They have only fallen asleep
They have only fallen asleep
They have only fallen asleep

I've seen it many times
Each time they close their eyes and say goodbye
Rest in peace and give yourself to harmony
I've seen it many times
Each time they close their eyes and say goodbye
Rest in peace and give yourself to harmony
Give yourself to harmony
Underneath the stars
