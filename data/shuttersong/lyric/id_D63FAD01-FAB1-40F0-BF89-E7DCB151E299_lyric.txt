All my bitches got real hair chilling with the top down
Screaming like ayo
I'mma take her ass down when she bring her friend around
Fuck 'em both like ayo
I'm a bougie ass nigga left the roof at home
We popping like ayo, ayo, ayo

But don't be acting like I need you
Ahhh! Aye babe this my new shit
I'm the black Richie Rich with the roof missing
If it don't make dollars it don't make sense
Z, wake up like I gotta get it
And I got an engine full of trunk space
I get money three ways, fucking bitches three ways
7 different foreigns plus she no hablé
But I make that bitch walk for some cheesecake
Yeah, I'm the coldest nigga, icy
Looking in the mirror like I wish I can be me
She too into me, I'm more into money
My hooby's her body, that pussy's my lobby
I'mma eat it, I'mma eat it
I don't lie, hope my dick's, too conceited

My chain shine brighter than a stobe light
I'm tryna fuck Coco, this don't concern Ice
If I motorboat, she gon' motorbike
A nigga ain't worried about nothin'
Rehabilitation just had me worried about fucking
Money, decision-making only worried about stunting
She worried about me, her nigga worried about cuffing
I wanna see her body (bodyyyy)
She said get inside of me
I wanna feel you baby (yeahhh)
Just bring the animal right out of me

(Uh, you losin' money, I win mills Dr. J
She's gonna follow my lead, Simon Says)
Paper, paper, I'm riding scrapers in California
Car smell like ammonia, we got that stank on us
(Never been an Outkast that stank on ya
From the ghetto but my bitch like Apollonia)

We in the hood, tatted like a Mexican
Car too fast, give a fuck about pedestrians

Got your bitch, I'm that nigga
