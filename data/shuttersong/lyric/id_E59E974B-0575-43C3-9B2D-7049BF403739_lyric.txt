When you close your eyes
You can see the day rewind
All the laughs and stupid fights
You and I we roll like thunder in the skies.
Just like a party breaks at dawn, it never stops for long.
I will return don't you ever hang your head

I will return in every song in each sunset
Our memory is always within reach
I will return, I will return don't you ever hang your head.
When you're feeling empty

I will be the fuel you need
To keep on pushing on down the lonely street
And I'm always in the dark unseen
Home like headlights on the lawn, I'm never gone for long.
I will return don't you ever hang your head
I will return in every song in each sunset

Our memory is always within reach
I will return, I will return don't you ever hang your head.
I will return don't you ever hang your head
I will return don't you ever hang your head
I will return in every song in each sunset
Our memory is always within reach
I will return, I will return don't you ever hang your head.
