Who is the man I see
Where I'm supposed to be?
I lost my heart
I buried it too deep
Under the iron sea

Oh crystal ball, crystal ball save us all
Tell me life is beautiful

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Lines ever more unclear
Not sure I'm even here

The more I look the more I think that I'm
Starting to disappear
Oh crystal ball, crystal ball save us all

Tell me life is beautiful
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Oh crystal ball hear my song
I'm fading out
Everything I know is wrong

So put me where I belong
I don't know where I am

And I don't really care

I look myself in the eye
There's no one there
I fall upon the earth

I call upon the air
But all I get is the same old vacant stare
Oh crystal ball, crystal ball save us all
Tell me life is beautiful
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Oh crystal ball hear my song
I'm fading out
Everything I know is wrong
So put me where I belong
