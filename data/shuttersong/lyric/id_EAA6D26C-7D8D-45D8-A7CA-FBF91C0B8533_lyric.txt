Alive - One Direction
My mother told me I should go and get some therapy
I asked the doctor can you find out what is wrong with me
I don't know why I wanna be with every girl I meet
I can't control it
Yeah  I know it's taking over me
I'm going crazy
Can't contain it
So tell me just what I should do
She said  hey  it's alright
Does it make you feel alive 
Don't look back
Live your life
Even if it's only for tonight
She said  hey  it's alright
If it makes you feel alive
Went to a party  just after the doctor talked to me
I met a girl  I took her  end up to the balcony
I whisper something in her ear that I just can't repeat
She said okay  but she was worried what her friends will think
She's going crazy
Can't contain it
She asked what should I do 
I said  hey  it's alright
Does it make you feel alive 
Don't look back
Live your life
Even if it's only for tonight
I said  hey  it's alright
If it makes you feel alive
We got to live before we get older
Do what we like
We got nothing to lose
Shake off the weight of the world from your shoulders
We got nothing to prove
I said  hey  it's alright
Does it make you feel alive 
Don't look back
Live your life
Even if it's only for tonight
I said  hey  it's alright
Does it make you feel alive 
Don't look back
Live your life
Even if it's only for tonight
I said  hey  it's alright
If it makes you feel alive
