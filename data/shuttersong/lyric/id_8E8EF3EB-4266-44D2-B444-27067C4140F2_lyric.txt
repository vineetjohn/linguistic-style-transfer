I just wanna say fuck you til I fuck you again
I think I've had enough of you, but I don't wanna lose a friend
I'm gonna love you forever
That's just my curse
It's whatever

I thought you'd leave me
I'm the bottle, you're the genie
And I don't think I give a damn
I felt the beating
Thank god I ate my wheaties
Or I don't know if I could stand
We hate to give in, but we're hardly living comfortably
I hate you because you think that you're still in love with me
It's time we drift apart, we're blind and in the dark
I kinda wanna care but it's kinda too late to start
And here you are, hitting my line
Hitting rewind on the past for the 50th time
Come on tell me, what do you think
Wanna lay down, up in the clouds or under the sheets

I just wanna say fuck you til I fuck you again
I think I've had enough of you, but I don't wanna lose a friend
I'm gonna love you forever
That's just my curse
It's whatever

It's the morning
You're even pretty when you're snoring
Like why the fuck are you perfect
You're way too gorgeous
I quit, you win, I forfeit
I'm sick of having make-up sex
We fight hard, we play rough
We break hearts
And say stuff we actually mean as you cry off your makeup
We're terrible for each other
I'll say without a stutter
My head is over heels, but only when we're under covers
And here you are, trying to leave
Knocking my wind, taking my breath then dying to breathe
You're the drug I'm fiending for
You're the cut I'm bleeding for
I'm saying "fuck you" and I wanna fuck you even more

I just wanna say fuck you til I fuck you again
(Yeah, I just want to say)
I think I've had enough of you, but I don't wanna lose a friend
I'm gonna love you forever (And I'm gonna love you)
That's just my curse
It's whatever

Oh my God I love you so
But look at the clock, its time to go
I'm sorry that I was not better but
Don't blame the rain on the weatherman
Oh my God, I'm fucking cold (I'm fucking cold)

I just wanna say fuck you til I fuck you again
(I just wanna say, I just wanna say)
I think I've had enough of you, but I don't wanna lose a friend
(No No No-No No)
I'm gonna love you forever
(I'm gonna love you)
That's just my curse
It's whatever

I just wanna say fuck you til I fuck you again
I think I've had enough of you, but I don't wanna lose a friend
I'm gonna love you forever (And I'm gonna love you)
That's just my curse
It's whatever

And I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you
