Here is your broken character, the one left of Heaven
Scissors cut him from the page, example
Continue to read not to retrace the steps, touch me
The hemorrhaging has ceased, has ceased

And I swallow these capsules, to regain my grip
And I swallowed myself sick
And I inherited my health
And I inherited my health

Here is your wake and smile, that you seem to need
The safe and the touch, and the unweave
Right where you placed it the night before
Saint checks in to make sure
You're right where you say that you are
Right where you are

And I swallow these capsules, to regain my grip
And I swallowed myself sick
And I inherited my health
And I inherited my health

And I couldn't have seen
All these pictures of me
But I needed to
(But I needed to)
And I needed to I
Couldn't find a better way
Couldn't find a better way
To lie

And I swallow these capsules, to regain my grip
And I swallowed myself sick
And I inherited my health
And I inherited my health

And I couldn't have seen all these pictures of me
But I needed to
(But I needed to)
And I needed to I
Couldn't find a better way
Couldn't find a better way
Couldn't find a better way
Couldn't find a better way
To lie, to lie, to lie, to lie
