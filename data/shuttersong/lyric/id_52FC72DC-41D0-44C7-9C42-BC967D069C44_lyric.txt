Back On The Chain Gang Remastered£© - Pretenders	
I found a picture of you  oh oh oh oh	
	
What hijacked my world that night	
	
To a place in the past	
We¡¯ve been cast out of? oh oh oh oh	
	
Now we¡¯re back in the fight	
	
We¡¯re back on the train	
	
Oh back on the chain gang	
	
A circumstance beyond our control  oh oh oh oh	
	
The phone, the tv and the news of the world	
	
Got in the house like a pigeon from hell  oh oh oh oh	
	
Threw sand in our eyes and descended like flies	
	
Put us back on the train	
	
Oh  back on the chain gang	
	
The powers that be	
	
That force us to live like we do	
	
Bring me to my knees	
	
When I see what they¡¯ve done to you	
	
But I¡¯ll die as I stand here today	
	
Knowing that deep in my heart	
	
They¡¯ll fall to ruin one day	
	
For making us part	
	
I found a picture of you, oh oh oh oh	
Those were the happiest days of my life	
	
Like a break in the battle was your part  oh oh oh oh	
	
In the wretched life of a lonely heart	
	
Now we¡¯re back on the train	
	
Oh back on the chain gang
