We are
Friends for life
Hold that
Deep inside
Let this
Be your drive
To survive

And just stand
High and tall
Make sure
You give your all
And if you
Ever fall
Know that I'm right here

We'll always be together
Don't you worry

Don't you worry

Just know that we'll meet again
And we'll always be together
Forever always
Oh

Find me

In the sky
Dancing
With the moon and night
Your heartbeat
Is disguised as my

Lullaby
Be happy
And know that I'm
Watching
You travel far and wide
Waiting
For us to meet again
We'll always be together

Don't you worry
Don't you worry
I'll always be by your side
Don't you worry
Don't you worry
The circle will never end

It'll never ends
Just know that we'll meet again

We'll meet again

And we'll always be together
Forever always

Look for me friend

When you need me
The heavens will send
A message within
Straight to your heart
Uooohhhuuooh!...
We'll always be together
Don't you worry
Don't you worry, no
I'll always be by your side
Don't you worry
Never worry about a thing
No no no no no no no
The circle will never end
It'll never end
Just know that we'll meet again

And we'll always be together
Forever always
