Came in like the breeze,
I felt it in my knees
Never will it leave
Each day it is retread
Seems like yesterday
Your eyes craved this way
Into my soul you starred
And bored down every faith
We built our own house, own house
With the hands over our hearts
And we swore on that day
That it will never fall apart
We built our own house, own house
With the hands over our hearts
And we swore on that day
That it will never fall apart
Will never fall apart-part
Will never fall apart-part
With the hands over our hearts
Will never fall apart-part

Wake up to the sun
Clouds always come undone
You give the light I need
Like water to the seed
Waiting in until
One to talk to be real
And prove wrong it seems
Our heart can truly mean
We built our own house, own house
With the hands over our hearts
And we swore on that day
That it will never fall apart
We built our own house, own house
With the hands over our hearts
And we swore on that day
That it will never fall apart
Will never fall apart-part
Will never fall apart-part
With the hands over our hearts
Will never fall apart-part

Take it all, take it away
We'll still have the sun dying
And the love that is beating
'Till our lungs stop breathing
Take it all, take it away
We'll still have our reaches,
No need for stitches
'Cause love melts the pain
Take it all, take it away
(Love me, love me)
Take it all, take it away
(Love me, love me)
Take it all, take it away
(Love me, love me)
Take it all!

We built our own house, own house
With the hands over our hearts
And we swore on that day
That it will never fall apart
Will never fall apart-part
Will never fall apart-part
With our hands over our hearts
Will never fall apart-part
