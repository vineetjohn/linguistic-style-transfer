Behold
The new hate with all the same lost values
Forsake
What lives deeper in death we're all believers
Raise up your sirens, break through the silence
We are united in the search for something more

Cross your heart
open your mind

Hide your face in their disguise
Even when I fall down to my knees
I'll never say a prayer I don't believe
And I don't wanna look up to the Son

But I will never be the faithless one

No I will never be the faithless one
Refuse
To destroy the altars we are serving
The truth
In living is that our souls are searching
Live with defiance it's time to fight

Don't ever let them keep your words from being heard
Cross your heart
Open your mind

Hide your face in their disguise
Even when I fall down to my knees
I'll never say a prayer I don't believe
And I don't wanna look up to the Son

But I will never be the faithless one

No I will never be the faithless one
Even when I fall down to my knees
I'll never say a prayer I don't believe
And I don't wanna look up to the Son
But I will never be the faithless one
Even when I fall down to my knees
I'll never say a prayer I don't believe
And I don't wanna look up to the Son
But I will never be the faithless one
No I will never be the faithless one
And I will never be the faithless one
