Ohhh you make me up and down through emotions
Like a rollercoaster
Spin like a ferris wheel
Ohhh you turn me upside down with my feelings
And I know the reason
Baby your love is surreal

You make me go X5 (woah)
Let's go
Like a rollercoaster

There’s a high level of love going on
The feelings are just way too strong
The reason that you got me gone
Is baby cause you turn me on
With a bit of it more than a little bit
I get addicted every time I get a hit of it
Cause oh baby you take me so high
When I’m on your rollercoaster ride

I’m in and out of love
And it’s all because
I can’t make up my mind
I’m so confused
Don’t know what to do
And it’s 'cause of you

Ohhh you make me up and down through emotions
Like a rollercoaster
Spin like a ferris wheel
Ohhh you take me upside down with my feelings
And I know the reason
Baby your love is surreal


Boy you give me butterflies
So deep inside
Brings me down when I look in those eyes
Takes me out way across the sky
Baby boy I won’t lie
Usually I’m not this shy
You do it to me every time
I get on your rollercoaster ride

I’m in and out of love
And it’s all because
I can’t make up my mind
I’m so confused
Don’t know what to do
And it’s 'cause of you

Ohhh you bring me up and down through emotions
Like a rollercoaster
Spin like a ferris wheel
Ohhh you take me upside down with my feelings
And I know the reason
Baby your love is surreal

You make me go X3
Make Me go
You make me go X2
Like a rollercoaster

Cause you make me go up and down
And around and around and
I can’t take it
You make me go up and down
And around and around
That’s why boy I can’t take it

I’m in and out of love
And it’s all because
I can’t make up my mind
I’m so confused
Don’t know what to do
And it’s 'cause of you
