Love Me Like You Do - Ellie Goulding
You're the light  you're the night
You're the color of my blood
You're the cure  you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much  so much
You're the fear  I don't care
Cause I've never been so high
Follow me to the dark
Let me take you past our satellites
You can see the world you brought to life  to life
So love me like you do  love me like you do
Love me like you do  love me like you do
Touch me like you do  touch me like you do
What are you waiting for 
Fading in  fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin is a holy gray I've got to find
Only you can set my heart on fire  on fire
Yeah  I'll let you set the pace
Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head spinning around I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for 
Love me like you do  love me like you do
Like you do
Love me like you do  love me like you do
Touch me like you do  touch me like you do
What are you waiting for 
Love me like you do  love me like you do
Like you do
Love me like you do  love me like you do
Touch me like you do  touch me like you do
What are you waiting for 
I'll let you set the pace
Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head spinning around I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for 
Love me like you do  love me like you do
Like you do
Love me like you do  love me like you do
Touch me like you do  touch me like you do
What are you waiting for 
Love me like you do  love me like you do
Like you do
Love me like you do  love me like you do
Touch me like you do  touch me like you do
What are you waiting for
