I the Sun ov man
The offspring ov the stellar race
My halo fallen and crushed upon the earth
So that I may bring balance to this world

I son ov perdition
From sheer nothingness transgressed
Unto the highest self -- to utmost freedom
To explore the starry nature ov my rage

I pulse ov existence
The law ov nature undenied
I hold the torch ov Heraclites
So I can shake the earth and move the suns

I divine Iconoclast
Injecting chaos into my veins
With life accepted
With pain resurrected
Is the embrace ov god in man profound

The joy ov a dawn
The ecstasy ov dusk
Nourished have I this karmic flow
Where great above meets great below
Let it be written!
Let it be done!
Scattered I walk towards the fractured light
