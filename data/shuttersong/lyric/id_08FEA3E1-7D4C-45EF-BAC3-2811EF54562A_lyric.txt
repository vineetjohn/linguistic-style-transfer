I remember when, I remember
I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo in so much space
And when you're out there without care

Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much
Does that make me crazy?

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Probably
And I hope that you are

Having the time of your life
But think twice
That's my only advice
Come on now, who do you

Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha ha ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?
Well, I think you're crazy

I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me
My heroes had the heart

To lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember
Is thinking, I want to be like them
Ever since I was little

Ever since I was little
It looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done
But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably
