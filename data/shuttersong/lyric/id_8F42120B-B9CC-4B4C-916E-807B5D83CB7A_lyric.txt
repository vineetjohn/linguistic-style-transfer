[Luke:]
Started out like in the movies
But it ended like a bad dream
Curtain opened, heard the crowd roar
This one's a repeat, seen it before

[Calum:]
Rewind to the start before it all went wrong
What's going on?

[Luke:]
Fast forward to the end, after everyone's gone home
And they've forgotten it all

[All:]
This ain't a movie that I wanna see
A tragic story, starring you and me
Yell "cut", we're stuck inside this scene
This is heartache on the big screen
The clock is ticking, and I'm out of time
The camera's rolling, and I forgot my lines
My script is ripped and now I see

[Luke:]
This is heartache on the big screen
This is heartache on the big screen

[Calum:]
Curtain closes on this clich¨¦
A good story of a bad day
Back to square one where I started
As I stand here broken-hearted

Fast forward to the end, after everyone's gone home
And they've forgotten it all

[All:]
This ain't a movie that I wanna see
A tragic story, starring you and me
Yell "cut", we're stuck inside this scene
This is heartache on the big screen
The clock is ticking, and I'm out of time
The camera's rolling, and I forgot my lines
My script is ripped and now I see

[Luke:]
This is heartache on the big screen

[Michael:]
If Hollywood could see me now
I'd get the starring role
But they won't so I'll just keep on acting a fool

[Luke:]
This ain't a movie that I wanna see
A tragic story, starring you and me
Yell "cut", we're stuck inside this scene
Yeah

[All:]
The clock is ticking, and I'm out of time
The camera's rolling, and I forgot my lines
My script is ripped and now I see

[Luke:]
This is heartache on the big screen
This is heartache on the big screen
This is heartache on the big screen
