Austin Mahone!
Lemme get it, ain't no playing with it
Banga banga
Lemme get it, Banga banga

Fire, make it shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot
You're so automatic
Can't none of them see you
Five stars going off on 'em baby
I love how you flex
Your style is so crazy, you're a fire on the set
You're a problem, girl, gotta get you

Ain't no waitin' with it
The one you came here with
Tell that boy forget it
Fate is what to tell him
'Cause I got him next
You don't need no explanation
Let him see and figure it out

Your eyes are telling that you're riding with me
But I'd be lyin' if I didn't admit it

The things I wanna say to you right here
I didn't say it but I just can't say it 'til I said it

You're a banga banga banga banga banga
I wanna pledge a bet
Before the night is over
Girl, I'm gonna make it that
So, promise if I make you mine
So, promise if I make you mine
You ain't gonna play with that
Show me where that turnt up at

You're a banga banga banga banga
I wanna pledge a bet
Before the night is over
Girl, I'm gonna make it that
So, promise if I make you mine
So, promise if I make you mine
You ain't gonna play with that
Show me where that turnt up at

You gotta promise, if I let you hop up in the jeep
You gon' turn up in the seat
You like ridin', don't ya?
(You ain't gonna play with that)
You like ridin', don't ya?
(You ain't gonna play with that

Show me where that turnt up at)

I don' said it, now what you gon' do
Formal introduction
You got me focused, now it's time for you
To show me something

You're like a trophy on my dash
A diamond that you are

Love to see you shining like a proper superstar
Got me asthmatic
'Cause you're like a perfect ballerina

I'm on my Brad Pitt, come and be my future Angelina
(Now you know enough to get it)

Baby, if you let me love you, I ain't never gonna stop

You're a banga banga banga banga
I wanna pledge a bet
Before the night is over
Girl, I'm gonna make it that
So, promise if I make you mine
So, promise if I make you mine
You ain't gonna play with that
Show me where that turnt up at

You're a banga banga banga banga
I wanna pledge a bet
Before the night is over
Girl, I'm gonna make it that
So, promise if I make you mine
So, promise if I make you mine
You ain't gonna play with that
Show me where that turnt up at

Show me-show me where that turnt up-turnt up
Show me-show me, where that-where that

Show me-show me, turnt up-turnt up

Where that turnt up at
Your eyes are telling that you're riding with me

But I'd be lyin' if I didn't admit
The things I wanna say to you right here

I didn't said it but I just can't say it 'til I said it
You're a banga banga banga banga
I wanna pledge a bet
Before the night is over

You gotta promise, if I let you hop up in the Jeep

Show me where that turnt up at)
You like ridin', don't ya?
