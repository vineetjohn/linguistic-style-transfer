A week ago you said to me
"Do you believe I'll never be too far"
If you're lost, just look for me
You'll find me in the region of the summer stars
The fact that we can sit right here and say goodbye
Means we've already won
The necessity for apologies between you and me
Baby, there is none


A-ooo-ooo-ooo
We had some good times, didn't we?
A-ooo-ooo-ooo
We had some good tricks up our sleeve
A-ooo-ooo-ooo
Goodbyes are bittersweet
But it's not the end
I'll see your face again


You will find me
Yeah you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind
Walking in the wind


Yesterday I went out to celebrate the birthday of a friend
But as we raised our glasses up to make a toast
I realized you were missing


A-ooo-ooo-ooo
We had some good times, didn't we?
A-ooo-ooo-ooo
We wore our hearts out on our sleeve
A-ooo-ooo-ooo
Goodbyes are bittersweet
But it's not the end
I'll see your face again


You will find me
Yeah you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind
Walking in the wind

And I know we'll be alright child
Just close your eyes and see
I'll be by your side
Any time you're needing me

Oh yeah


You will find me
Yeah you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind
Walking in the wind
Walking in the wind
