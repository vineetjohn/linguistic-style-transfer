Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound

I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away, I can feel your halo (Halo) halo

I can see your halo (Halo) halo
I can feel your halo (Halo) halo
I can see your halo (Halo) halo ooh
Hit me like a ray of sun

Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again

But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again
Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
The risk that I'm taking
I'm never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away, I can feel your halo (Halo) halo
I can see your halo (Halo) halo
I can feel your halo (Halo) halo
I can see your halo (Halo) halo ooh
Halo ooh, halo ooh
Everywhere I'm looking now, I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away, I can feel your halo (Halo) halo
I can see your halo (Halo) halo
I can feel your halo (Halo) halo
I can see your halo (Halo) halo ooh
