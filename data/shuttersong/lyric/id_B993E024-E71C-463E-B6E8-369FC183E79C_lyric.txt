I've been rollin stones, all my life
Flyin all alone, flyin blind
I've seen it all, I've been around
I've been lost and I've been found

But who I am with you is who I really wanna be
You're so good for me
And when I'm holding you
It feels like I got the world in my hands
Yeahh a better man it's who I am with you

I've got a ways to go, on this ride
But I got a hand to hold, it fits just right
You've made me laugh, you made me high
You've made me wanna hold on tight

But who I am with you is who I really wanna be
You're so good for me
And when I'm holding you
It feels like I got the world in my hands
Yeahh a better man it's who I am with you
Who I am with you
Because of you I'm a lucky man
And you're the best part of who I am

Who I am with you is who I really wanna be
You're so good, so good for me baby
And when I'm holding you
It feels like I got the world in my hands
Yeahh a better man it's who I am with you
Yeah its who I am with you
