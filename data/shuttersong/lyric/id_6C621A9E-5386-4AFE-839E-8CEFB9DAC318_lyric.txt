Oh, hey, oh

Baby, baby, are you listening?
Wondering where you've been all my life
I just started living
Oh, baby, are you listening?

Baby, can you hear me?
When I'm crying out for you
I'm scared oh, so scared
But when you're near me
I feel like I'm standing with an army
Of men armed with weapons, hey, oh

When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

I love lying next to you
I could do this for eternity
You and me—we're meant to be
In holy matrimony
God knew exactly what he was doing
When he led me to you

When you say you love me
Know I love you more (I love you more)
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
