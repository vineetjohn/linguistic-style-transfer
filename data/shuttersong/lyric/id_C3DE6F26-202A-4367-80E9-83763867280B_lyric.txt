I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care,
But it's so cold and I don't know where.
I bought you daffodills, in a pretty string,
But they won't flower like they did last spring

And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright,
I'm just so tired to share my nights,
I wanna cry and I wanna love
but all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love,
All my tears have been used up,
On another love, another love,
All my tears have been used up,
On another love another love,
All my tears have been used up

And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight,
But my hands been broken one too many times
So I use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude

Words they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song, that'll be just ours,
But I sang them all to another heart
And I wanna cry I wanna learn to love,

But all my tears have been used up.
On another love, another love,
All my tears have been used up,
On another love, another love,
All my tears have been used up,
On another love, another love,

All my tears have been used up.

I wanna sing a song, that'll be just ours,
But I sang them all to another heart

And I wanna cry I wanna fall in love,
But all my tears have been used up.
On another love, another love,
All my tears have been used up,
On another love, another love,
All my tears have been used up,
On another love, another love,
All my tears have been used up.
