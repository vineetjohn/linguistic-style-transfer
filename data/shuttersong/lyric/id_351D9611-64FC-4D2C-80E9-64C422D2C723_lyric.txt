Look at the ivy on the old clinging wall
Look at the flowers and the green grass so tall
It's not a matter of when push comes to shove
It's just a hour on the wings of a dove

It's just warm love
It's just warm love

I dig it when you're fancy dressed up in lace
I dig it when you have a smile on your face
This inspiration's got to be on the flow
But these invitation's got to see it and know

It's just warm love
It's just warm love

And it's ever present everywhere
And it's ever present everywhere
Warm love

And it's ever present everywhere
And it's ever present everywhere
That warm love

To the country I'm going
Lay and laugh in the sun
You can bring your guitar along
We'll sing some songs, we'll have some fun

The sky is crying and it's time to go home
And we shall hurry to the car from the foam
Sit by the fire and dry out our wet clothes
It's raining outside from the skies up above

Inside, it's warm love
Inside, it's warm love

And it's ever present everywhere
And it's ever present everywhere
That warm love

And it's ever present everywhere
And it's ever present everywhere
That warm love, I can feel it

And it's ever present everywhere
And it's ever present everywhere
That warm love, hey

And it's ever present everywhere
And it's ever present everywhere
That warm love, hey

And it's ever present everywhere
And it's ever present everywhere
That warm love
