I heard that you've been
Self-medicating in the quiet of your room
It's sweet suburban tomb
And if you need a friend
I'll help you stitch up your wounds

I heard that you've been
Having some trouble finding your place in the world
I know how much that hurts
But if you need a friend
Then please just say the word

You've come this far
You're all cleaned up
You've made a mess again
There is no more trying
Time to sort yourself out
Hold on tight
This ride is a wilde one

Make no mistake
The day will come
When you can't cover up what you've done

Now don't lose your fight, kid
It only takes a little push to pull on trough

There is so much left to do
You'll be missing out
And we'll be missing you

And we'll be missing you
Grit your teeth, pull your hair,
Paint the walls black and scream,
