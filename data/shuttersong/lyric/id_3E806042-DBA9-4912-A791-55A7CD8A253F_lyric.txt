Never got love from a government man
Heading downstream till the levee gives in
What can I do to get the money
We ain't got the money, we ain't gettin' out

Heading downstream till the levee gives in
And my dreams are wearin' thin
All I need's relief
I need, I need some sympathy

Look at me
I just can't believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
Look at me
I just can't believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream

All of my life been wadin' in
Water so deep now we got to swim
Wonder will it ever end
How long, how long till we have a friend

Comin' down, feelin' like a battery hen
Waves won't break till the tide comes in
What will I do in the sunrise
What will I do without my dreams

Look at me
I just can't believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
Look at me
I just can't believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream

We're all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We're all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We're all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
I just wanna dream...
Baby, you know me
