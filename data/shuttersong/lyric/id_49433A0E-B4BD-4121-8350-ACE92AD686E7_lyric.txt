First let me hop out motherfucking Porsche
I don't want her if that ass don't sit like a horse
I be balling on these niggas got me feeling like sports
Dash got so much wood I could build me a fort
Too many things i ain't done yet
I'm the king of this shit
Crown by the toilet
I'm just barely getting started
You already upset
Got a tiger as a pet
I just took em to the vet
Homie I been making hits
I'm the rap Derek Jeter
Let your bitch ride on me
Like she was on a feeder
If the pussy ain't good
Then I prolly won't feed her
Lil homie you can keep her
Because I really don't need her
I ain't worried bout a featuree
Homeboy you's a pee on
Toilet seat ass nigga man I swear you getting peed on
Man my jewelry so cold i walk around with the heat on
My alarm clock set just in case they wanna sleep on
Ya diiiiggg
Imma full time playa
Hopping out of alligators
Sipping lean and now a later
Homie I'll annihilate you
If you think you wanna battle
You gone have to pay some paper
I just hit her and I quit her
I will never ever dater her
It's a shame how I'm barely getting love in this city
Travel to another town, you can bet they fucking with me
I be killin this shit
Pray to God they forgive me
They say when you blow up don't forget me
Maaaannn
I been on fire
Ever since they made the lighter
My boys a pull up on yo homie, I ain't talking diapers
Walk into your function on point I'm like a sniper
My girl bad like Dej Loaf so don't try her
Flexing all on ya other homeboys you ain't ready
10 times sharper than Michael Myers machete
Been about the money I ain't worried bout the fame
Bout to have everybody saying who is Rickey Wayne
That's me
