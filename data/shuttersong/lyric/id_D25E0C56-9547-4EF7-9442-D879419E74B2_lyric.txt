In the land of Gods and Monsters
I was an angel
living in the garden of evil
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed
Shinin' like a fiery beacon

You got that medicine I need
Fame, Liquor, Love, give it to me slowly
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly
Me and God we don't get along, so now I sing

No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees sprees and I'm singing
'Fuck yeah give it to me this is heaven, what I truly want'
It's innocence lost
Innocence lost

In the land of Gods and Monsters
I was an angel
Looking to get fucked hard
Like a groupie incognito posing as a real singer
Life imitates art

You got that medicine I need
Dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said 'baby, that's alright with me'

No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees sprees and I'm singing
'Fuck yeah give it to me this is heaven, what I truly want'
It's innocence lost
Innocence lost

When you talk it's like a movie
And you're makin' me crazy --
'Cause life imitates art
If I get a little prettier
Can I be your baby?
You tell me, \
