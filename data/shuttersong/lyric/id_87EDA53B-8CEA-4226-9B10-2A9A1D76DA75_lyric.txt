A love that never ends
You

Yeah, it's almost like
Can't nobody do it quite right
Like I do it, right?
Give it to you how you live

Can we pretend
That everything is like yesterday?
What if I just wanna feel you touching me?
Ain't nobody perfect
So if you take a while I'll make it worth it
I wanna pretend
Let's pretend that we 'bout to break up
To catch the feelings that I want we make up
Legs up, suicide, north side
We never count points when we court side

Let's pretend I ain't your friend
So we can get it on again
Let's pretend we never met
A good excuse to play forget
Let's pretend you never lied
So I can give it up all night
Swallow my pride and learn to forgive
When I'm looking for love I pretend it's you

A love that never ends
I pretend it's you
That I'm in love with

If we pretend that I'm happy when I'm really not
Pretend that I give you everything I got
Pretend that I'm there when I ain't there
Pretend that I care when I don't care
Once upon a time I did
Now I admit that I was fucking with a kid
Now I pretend that everything's straight
When everything ain't just covered up like paint

Let's pretend it's my first time
So you can really blow my mind
Let's pretend we never met
A good excuse to play forget
Let's pretend you never lied
So I can give it up all night
Swallow my pride and learn to forgive
When I'm looking for love I pretend it's you

A love that never ends
I pretend it's you
That I'm in love with

[A$AP Rocky:]
To never fool around with you was my best deed
Stand up, got a heart up on my left sleeve
When I could find another lover by the next week
Besties turn to ex-ies from a pet tease
Fuck what these other niggas on, I came to flaunt
What's that A$AP, little Saint Laurent?
Probably what you're thinking 'bout, the commas in my bank account
Pretty bitches bring 'em out, jiggy nigga in the house
When I caught her dancing by the couch
With her little booty hanging out
Her blouse sticking something in her stomach
Got her screaming out, "I'm coming," fronting like you really want it
Still my nigga though

You
A love that never ends
I pretend it's you
That I'm in love with

Can we pretend?
Can we pretend?
Can we pretend?
