When tomorrow comes
I'll be on my own
Feeling frightened of
The things that I don't know
When tomorrow comes
When tomorrow comes

When tomorrow comes

When tomorrow comes
And though the road is long
I look up to the sky
Darkness all around, I hope that I could fly
And I sing along, and I sing along
And I sing along, and I sing along
I got all I need when I got you and I
Cause I look around me and see a sweet life

I'm stuck in the dark
But you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
I can't stop my heart
When you're shining in my eyes

I can't lie, it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark
But you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me through the night
Ohhhh, ohhhh

Gettin' me through the night
Ohhhh, ohhhh
Cause you're my flashlight
Cause you're my flashlight
Cause you're my flashlight
Cause you're my flashlight

Gettin' me through the night

I got all I need when I got you and I
Cause I look around me and see a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark
But you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me through the night (We belong)
Can't stop my heart
When you're shining in my eyes
I can't lie, it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark
But you're my flashlight
You're gettin me through the night (We belong)
Cause you're my flashlight, Cause you're..., Cause you're my flashlight, Cause you're my flashlight, You're my flashlight
You're gettin' me through the night
Cause you're my flashlight, Cause you're my...
You're gettin' me through the night
