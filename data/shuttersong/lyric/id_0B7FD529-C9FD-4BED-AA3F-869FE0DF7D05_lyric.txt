I got your picture
I'm coming with you
Dear Maria, count me in
There's a story at the bottom of this bottle
& I'm the pen

When the lights go up
I wanna watch the way you
Take the stage by storm
The way you wrap those boys around your finger
Go on & play the leader
'Cause you know it's what you're good at
The low road for the fast track
Make every second last

'Cause I got your picture
I'm coming with you
Dear Maria, count me in
There's a story at the bottom of this bottle
& I'm the pen
Make it count when I'm the one
Who's selling you out
'Cause it feels like stealing hearts
Calling your name from the crowd

Then in the field you'll be the show girl of the home team
I'll be the narrator
Telling another tale of the American dream
I see your name in lights
We can make you a star
Girl, we'll take the world by storm
It isn't that hard

'Cause I got your picture
I'm coming with you
Dear Maria, count me in
There's a story at the bottom of this bottle
& I'm the pen
Make it count when I'm the one
Who's selling you out
'Cause it feels like stealing hearts
Calling your name from the crowd
Whoa

Take a breath, don't it sound so easy

Never had a doubt
Now I'm going crazy
Watching from the floor
Take a breath, & let the rest come easy
Never settle down
'Cause the cash flow leaves me

Always wanting more
'Cause I got your picture
I'm coming with you
