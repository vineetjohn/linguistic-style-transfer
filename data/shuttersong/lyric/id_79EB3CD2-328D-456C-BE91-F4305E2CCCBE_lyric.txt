Since you went away, everything is looking great
I'm a little bored
When I see you out, maybe walking in the street
You always cross the road

Listen honey, there is nothing you can say to surprise me
Listen honey, there is nothing you can do to offend me anymore
You don't send me anymore

Our little scene is getting smaller by the day
It's a human zoo
But the key is change, getting over all your problems
You're not a fool

Listen honey, there is nothing you can say to surprise me
Listen honey, there is nothing you can do to offend me
You don't send me

Every sound is tame, every group the bleedin' same
It would make you mad
What happened to the sounds that left you lying on the floor
Laughing, crying, jumping, singing

Listen honey, there is nothing you can say to astound me
Listen honey, there is nothing you can do to offend me anymore
You don't send me anymore
