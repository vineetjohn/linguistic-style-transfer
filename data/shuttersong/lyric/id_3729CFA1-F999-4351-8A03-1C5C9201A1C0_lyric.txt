Standing in a crowded room and I can't see your face
Put your arms around me, tell me everything's OK
In my mind, I'm running round a cold and empty space
Just put your arms around me, tell me everything's OK

Break my bones but you won't see me fall, oh
The rising tide will rise against them all, oh

Darling, hold my hand
Oh, won't you hold my hand?
Cause I don't wanna walk on my own anymore
Won't you understand?
Cause I don't wanna walk alone
I'm ready for this, there's no denying
I'm ready for this, you stop me falling
I'm ready for this, I need you all in

I'm ready for this, so darling hold my hand
Soul is like a melting pot when you're not next to me
Tell me that you've got me and you're never gonna leave
Tryna find a moment where I can find release

Please tell me that you've got me and you're never gonna leave
Break my bones but you won't see me fall, oh

The rising tide will rise against them all, oh
Darling, hold my hand
Oh won't you hold my hand?
Cause I don't wanna walk on my own anymore
Won't you understand?
Cause I don't wanna walk alone
I'm ready for this, there's no denying
I'm ready for this, you stop me falling

I'm ready for this, I need you all in
I'm ready for this, so darling, hold my hand
Don't wanna know
That feeling when I'm all alone
So please don't make me wait, cause I don't wanna break
And I don't wanna fall
When you're next to me
Can tell I'm not afraid to be

That you don't make me wait, and never let me break
You never let me fall
Darling, hold my hand
Oh, won't you hold my hand?
Cause I don't wanna walk on my own anymore
Won't you understand?
Cause I don't wanna walk alone
I'm ready for this, there's no denying
I'm ready for this, you stop me falling
I'm ready for this, I need you all in
I'm ready for this, so darling, hold my hand
