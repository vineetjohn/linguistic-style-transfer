You and I 
Could paint the sky together 
As the world goes by 
We'll go on forever 

Look into my eyes, eyes 
Eyes are the windows to the soul 
Look into my eyes, eyes 
Oh you will know 
There is no surprise, eyes 
Because love is plain to see 
Look into my eyes 
Eyes 

Truth is truth 
And time can never leap it 
This I know 
We will always keep it

Look into my eyes, eyes 
Eyes are the windows to the soul 
Look into my eyes, eyes 
Oh you will know 
There is no surprise, eyes 
Because love is plain to see 
Look into my eyes 
Eyes
