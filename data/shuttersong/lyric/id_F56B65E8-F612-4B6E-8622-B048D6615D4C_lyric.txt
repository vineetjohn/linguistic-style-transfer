We'll be singing

When we're winning

We'll be singing

I get knocked down

But I get up again

You're never gonna keep me down

I get knocked down

But I get up again

You're never gonna keep me down

Pissing the night away

Pissing the night away

He drinks a whiskey drink

He drinks a vodka drink

He drinks a lager drink

He drinks a cider drink

He sings the songs that remind him

Of the good times

He sings the songs that remind him

Of the better times

Oh, Danny Boy

Danny Boy

I get knocked down

But I get up again

You're never gonna keep me down

I get knocked down

But I get up again

You're never gonna keep me down

Pissing the night away

Pissing the night away

He drinks a whiskey drink

He drinks a vodka drink

He drinks a lager drink

He drinks a cider drink

He sings the songs that remind him

Of the good times

He sings the songs that remind him

Of the better times

Don't cry for me

Next door neighbor

I get knocked down

But I get up again

You're never gonna keep me down

I get knocked down

But I get up again

You're never gonna keep me down

I get knocked down

(We'll be singing)

But I get up again

You're never going to keep me down

(When we're winning)

I get knocked down

(We'll be singing)

But I get up again

You're never going to keep me down

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
