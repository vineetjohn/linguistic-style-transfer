All Aboard…
It was a big night in December, Chattanooga Tennessee
All the old folks still remember that snowy christmas eve
The way santa saved that holiday, it's still hard to believe

Oh the weather man was calling for the snow to keep comin' down
And the way that it was fallin', Rudolph never saw the ground
By Christmas day, santa's sleigh never made it to town

Then all at once they heard that mighty whistle blow (ha ha)
The ground started shaken', it even shook the mistletoe
And then comin' 'round the mountain, right through the steam and smoke
Pullin; 16 coaches shoutin' ho ho ho
Who needs a sleigh, Santa's got a choo-choo train

Well now, he could barely hold it comin' down the hill so fast
Yeah that shiny locomotive made it town in no time flat
But you can't go slow with a christmas load coming down the railroad tracks

When he pulled into the station and he finally shut her down
there was a big ol celebration, everyone gathered 'round
They passed out toys to the girls and boys from miles around

Then all at once they heard a mighty whistle blow (ha ha)
The ground started shaken', it even shook the mistletoe
And then goin' 'round the mountain, right through the steam and smoke
Pullin; 16 coaches shoutin' ho ho ho
Who needs a sleigh, when Santa's got a choo-choo train

Oh yeah, no need to fly away, Santa's got a choo-choo train!
