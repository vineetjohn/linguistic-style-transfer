Lean and dab, lean and dab
Lean and dab, lean and dab
Lean and dab, lean and dab
Lean and dab, lean and dab
Wake up in the morning then I dab
Had to pull up on the block cause today I get to whip
And you know my top drop and my car's name is nae-nae
Had to hit the Quan cause today is a good day
Slide to the left, slide to the right
Walk it to the front, bop it to the back
Slide to the left, slide to the right
Walk it to the front, bop it to the back
Lean and dab, lean and dab
Lean and dab, lean and dab
Lean and dab, lean and dab
Lean and dab, lean and dab
Nah, let me keep going
Show you how I lean, then dab
Nice shoes, car clean cause it's sunny outside
That mean I pull up with my top down
I don't have a top now
Mama told me never leave the house without my nightgown
Mama I'm on BET so I can act hyped now
On em like the WWE and lay the smackdown
That's a lot to handle, how could he manage?
Mr. Hit the Quan went viral, gigantic
Hold up wait face it, go ahead pump your brakes fast
Always used to dodge cops, riding around with no plate tags
They can never catch me, driving like a taxi
Waiting on my taxes, lights camera action
Finna play Michael Jackson, [?] in a jacket
Take it but I'm matching, y'all not in my bracket
It's iHeart Memphis but I also love dabbing
I done took off on em, I feel like a pilot
I done took off on em, I don't care bout the mileage
I'm so VIP all I know is private
I'll take the steak, the strip, and the salad
Cause growing up in Memphis, Tennessee I couldn't have it
Slide to the left, slide to the left
Slide to the left, hold on hit the folks
Slide to the right, slide to the right
Slide to the right, make it drop
Walk it to the front, walk it to the front
Walk it to the front, watch me whip
Bop it to the back, bop it to the back
Bop it to the back, nae-nae, nae-nae

Lean and dab, lean and dab
Lean and dab, lean and dab
Lean and dab, lean and dab
Lean and dab, lean and dab
Hit the Quan on em, hit the Quan on em
Hit the Quan on em, hit the Quan on em
Snap em up, pose, snap em up, pose
Snap em up, pose, snap em up, pose
Chop-a-chop chopped salad, chop-a-chop chop
Chop-a-chop chopped salad, chop-a-chop chop
You can google me, you can google me

You can google me, you can google me
