Boys call you sexy
And you don't care what they say
See every time you turn around they scream your name

Now I've got a confession (Ha Ha Ha Ha)
When I was young I wanted attention (Ha Ha Ha Ha)
And I promised myself that I'd do anything (Ha Ha Ha Ha)

Anything at all for them to notice me (La La La La)
But I ain't complaining (No)
We all wanna be famous (Oh)

So go ahead and say what you wanna say (Oh)
You know what its like to be nameless (Oh)
Want them to know what your name is (Oh)
'Cause see when I was younger I would say

When I grow up
I wanna be famous
I wanna be a star
I wanna be in movies

When I grow up
I wanna see the world
Drive nice cars
I wanna have groupies

When I grow up
Be on T.V.
People know me

Be on magazines
When I grow up
Fresh and clean
Number one chick when I step out on the scene

But be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it
But be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it

You just might get it
You just might get it- Get it?
They used to tell me I was silly (Ha Ha Ha Ha)
Until I popped up on the T.V (La La La La)

I always wanted to be a superstar (Ha Ha Ha Ha)
And knew that singing songs would get me this far (La La La La)
But I ain't complaining

We all wanna be famous
So go ahead and say what you wanna say
You know what its like to be nameless

Want them to know what your name is
'Cause see when I was younger I would say
When I grow up
I wanna be famous

I wanna be a star
I wanna be in movies
When I grow up
I wanna see the world

Drive nice cars
I wanna have groupies
When I grow up
Be on T.V.

People know me
Be on magazines
When I grow up

Fresh and clean
Number one chick when I step out on the scene
But be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it
You just might get it

You just might get it
But be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it

I see them staring at me
Oh, I'm a trend-setter
Yes this is true 'Cause what I do, no one can do it better

You can talk about me, 'Cause I'm a hot topic
I see you watching me watching me, watching me, and I know you want it
When I grow up

I wanna be famous
I wanna be a star,
I wanna be in movies
When I grow up

I wanna see the world
Drive nice cars
I wanna have groupies
When I grow up

Be on T.V.
People know me
Be on magazines
When I grow up

Fresh and clean
Number one chick when I step out on the scene

You just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it
But be careful what you wish for 'Cause you just might get it

You just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it (Get it?)
When I grow up
I wanna be famous
I wanna be a star
I wanna be in movies
When I grow up
I wanna see the world
Drive nice cars
I wanna have groupies
When I grow up

You just might get it
You just might get it- Get it?
