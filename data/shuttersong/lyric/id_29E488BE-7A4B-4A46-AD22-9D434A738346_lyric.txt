Here we go again
I kinda want to be more than friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid you're never satisfied

Here we go again
We're sick like animals, we play pretend

You're just a cannibal and I'm afraid I won't get out alive

No, I won't sleep tonight
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?

What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight.

Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kickin' in
It's getting heavy and I want to run and hide
I want to run and hide

I do it every time
You're killin' me now
And I won't be denied by you, the animal inside of you.

Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh
I want some more

Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight.

Hush, hush, the world is quiet
Hush, hush, we both can't fight it

It's us that made this mess
Why can't you understand?
Whoa, I won't sleep tonight
I won't sleep tonight
Here we go again

Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh

I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight.
