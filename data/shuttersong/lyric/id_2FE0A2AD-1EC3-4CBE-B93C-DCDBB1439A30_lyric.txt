The smile, the charm, the words, the spark
Everything, you had it
Guess I had a naive heart
Cause boy I let you have it
Said I was your only
Never thought you'd leave me lonely
You're just a lost boy
With your head up in the clouds

You're just a lost boy
Never keep your feet on the ground
Always gonna fly away
Just because you know you can
Never gonna learn there's no such place as Neverland
You don't understand

You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man
Peter Pan
Deep down, I knew that you
Were too good to be true
But every piece and part of me

Wanted to believe in you
Now it's happily ever never
I guess now I know better
You're just a lost boy
With your head up in the clouds
You're just a lost boy

You never keep your feet on the ground
You're always gonna fly away
Just because you know you can

Never gonna learn there's no such place as Neverland
You don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man
Peter Pan

Oh, woah, mmm
You're just a lost boy
Yeah, I know who you are
You don't know what you lost, boy
You're too busy chasing stars

And you're always gonna fly away
Just because you know you can
Never gonna learn there's no such place as Neverland
You don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man
You're never grow up
Yeah, you're never gonna be a man
Peter Pan
Never gonna be a man
