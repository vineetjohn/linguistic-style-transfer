Recently I've been
Hopelessly reachin
Out for this girl
Who's out of this world
Believe me

She's got a boyfriend
He drives her round the bend
Cause he's 23
He's in the marines
He'd kill me

For so many nights now
I find myself thinkin about her now ohhh

Cause obviously she's out of my league
But how can I win
She keeps draggin me in
And I know I
Never will be good enough for her
No no
I never will be good enough for her

(Danny)
Gotta escape now
Get on a plane now
Yeah
Off to LA
And that's where i'll stay
For two years

Put her behind me
(Put her behind me)
And go to a place where she can't find me ohhh

Cause obviously she's out of my league
I'm wastin my time
Cause she'll never be mine
And I know I
never will be good enough for her
No no
I never will be good enough for her

(Tom)
She's out of my hands
And I never know where I stand
Cause I'm not good enough for her
Good enough for her x6

(Danny)
Cause obviously she's out of my league
I'm wastin my time
Cause she'll never be mine
And I know I
never will be good enough for her
