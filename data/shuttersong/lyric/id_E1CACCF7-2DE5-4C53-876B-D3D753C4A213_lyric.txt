In the pines babe
In the pines
Fore told
White lies
Black watter
Shaky hands

Meet me in the hallow river
Kiss like an Indian giver
Black lungs
Take medicine men

Smoke signals
I can see it
Dont loose your American spirit
Second handing every air
This is where we had a smoke
With the savage hearts we

We live where the sun never shines
In the pines babe
In the pines
No one will find us there

In the pines
In the pines

In the pines
In the pines

In the pines
In the pines

No one will find you
