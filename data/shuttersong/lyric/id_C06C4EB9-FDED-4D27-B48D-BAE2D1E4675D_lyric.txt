You're talking to me but I never heard a word
Please excuse me, I was in another world
Did the denim on my legs got you shook?
I'll turn around so you can get a better look

Got my black cap on, I'mma put on a show
Now watch you watching me walk out the door

Who wears short shorts?
(We wear short shorts)
Who wears short shorts?
(We wear short shorts)
The shorter the better
The hotter the weather
Who wears short shorts?
I wear short shorts

(Roll 'em up)

You might wear the pants but I wear the shorts
Like to watch me dance, leave you wanting more
Say goodbye with them high on my waist
Sorry baby, had to put you in your place

Got my black cap on, I'mma put on a show
Now watch you watching me walk out the door
(Let's go)

Who wears short shorts?
(We wear short shorts)
Who wears short shorts?
(We wear short shorts)
The shorter the better
The hotter the weather
Who wears short shorts?

Oh-la-la-la
Oh-la-la-la
I'mma roll 'em up like, like it's my job
Oh-la-la-la
Oh-la-la-la
I'mma roll 'em up like, like it's my job

Got my black cap on, I'mma put on a show
Now watch you watching me walk out the door

Pardon my manners, I really don't mean to be watching, girl
But the way that you're walking so confident got them all staring and stopping, girl
Do you come around often, girl? I see those short shorts that you're rocking
Jaws are dropping, real talk, everyone's been talking
I'm thinking that you should come out to the ocean for the day, get away with me
(So hot, want to touch the hiney)

Oh yeah, I love the way you just don't care
Teasing me, it's so unfair
Baby, we should go somewhere
We should go somewhere, na, na
That denim on your waist, it's makes me want a taste of you

Who wears short shorts?
(We wear short shorts)
Who wears short shorts?
(We wear short shorts)
The shorter the better
The hotter the weather
Who wears short shorts?
I wear short shorts

Roll 'em up
