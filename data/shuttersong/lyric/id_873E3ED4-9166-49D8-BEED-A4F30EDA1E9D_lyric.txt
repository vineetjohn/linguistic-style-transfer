Oh oh yeah yeah come on
This is more than a typical kinda thing
Felt the jones in my bones when you were touching me, oh oh
Didn't want to take it slow
In a daze, going crazed, I can barely think
You're replaying in my brain, find it hard to sleep, oh oh

Waiting for my phone to blow
Now I'm here in a sticky situation
Got a little trouble, yep and now I'm pacin'
Five minutes, ten minutes, now it's been an hour

Don't wanna think too hard, but I'm sour

Oh oh, I can't seem to let you go
See I've been waiting all day
For you to call me baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight

Come on, that's right
Honest baby I'll do
Anything you want to
So can we finish what we started?
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight

Come on, that's right, cheerio
What's the time, such a crime
Not a single word
Sipping on that Patrón just to calm my nerves, oh oh

Poppin' bottles by the phone

Oh yeah
Had me up, had me down, turn me inside out
That's enough, hold me up
Maybe I'm in doubt, oh oh

And I don't even think you know, no no
See I've been waiting all day
For you to call me baby
So let's get up, let's get on it

Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Come on, that's right
Honest baby I'll do
Anything you want to
So can we finish what we started?
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight

Come on, that's right, cheerio
Anything you wanna do, I'll be on it too
Everything you say, it's like gone with the view
Business in the front, party in the back
Maybe I was wrong, was the outfit really wack?
This kinda thing doesn't happen usually
I'm on the opposite side of it, truthfully

I know you want it so come and get it, cheerio
See I've been waiting all day
For you to call me baby
So let's get up, let's get on it

Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Ohhhohohhhoohhhh
Honest baby I'll do
Anything you want to
So can we finish what we started?
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Come on, that's right, cheeri, cheeri, cheerio
When you gonna call?
Don't leave me broken hearted
I've been waiting up
Let's finish what we started, oh oh
I can't seem to let you go
Come on, that's right, cheerio, uh!
