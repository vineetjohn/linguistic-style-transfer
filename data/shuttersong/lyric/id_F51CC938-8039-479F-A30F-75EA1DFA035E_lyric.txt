I've been trying to love myself for real
I've been trying not to feel what I feel
I've been trying to be a bit less mistaken


It was real the feeling I had for you
And you told me how you need me too
Everyone kept saying it's not the real thing

How dare you break my lonely heart
And dance on the pieces
Being with you just tares me apart
Not again and again
Take you love and leave me behind
Realize we're mistaken
I don't need to be torn down
Not again and again

I've been wanting to die, just so you know
Trying to show them all how I'm alone
I've been hating my bedroom in the night

I've seen heaven and hell with you
I believed the lies you said were true
I've been trying to grow, I've been holding on
I've been trying to be strong

How dare you break my lonely heart
And dance on the pieces
Being with you just tares me apart
Not again and again
Take you love and leave me behind
Realize we're mistaken
I don't need to be torn down
Not again and again

Once again I just want to feel something true
Once again I just want to get closer to you
Nothing will ever change anyway
This is all we have
Not again will I lie to myself
Not again
