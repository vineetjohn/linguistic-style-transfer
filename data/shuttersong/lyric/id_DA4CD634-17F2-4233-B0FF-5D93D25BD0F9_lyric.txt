You take me down, spin me around
You got me running all the lights
Don't make a sound, talk to me now
Let me inside your mind

I don't know what you're thinking, sugar
But I just got that feeling, sugar
I can hear the sirens burning red lights turning
I can't turn back now

So hold on tight
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious

Oh oh oh oh oh
Da-dan-da-dangerous
Oh oh oh oh oh

Show me your soul, I gotta know
Bet that you're beautiful inside
Toes on the glass, car moving fast
Come take the wheel and drive

I don't know what you're thinking, sugar
But I just got that feeling, sugar
I can hear the sirens burning red lights turning
I can't turn back now

So hold on tight
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious

Oh oh oh oh oh
Da-dan-da-dangerous
Oh oh oh oh oh
Da-dan-da-dangerous

It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again
Come on, baby
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again

I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious

Oh oh oh oh oh
Da-dan-da-dangerous
Oh oh oh oh oh
Da-dan-da-dangerous
