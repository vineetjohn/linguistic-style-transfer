Circling your, circling your, circling your head
Contemplating everything you ever said
Now I see the truth I got a doubt
A different motive in your eyes and now I'm out see you later
I see your fantasy

You want to make it a reality paved in gold
See inside, inside of our heads, yeah
Well, now that's over
I see your motives inside

Decisions to hide
Back off, I'll take you on

Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
Headstrong, we're headstrong
Back off, I'll take you on

Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
And this is not where you belong
I won't give everything away

Conclusions manifest, your first impression's
Got to be your very best

I see you're full of shit and that's alright
That's how you play, I guess you get through
Every night, well, now that's over
I see your fantasy
You want to make it a reality paved in gold

See inside, inside of our heads, yeah
Well, now that's over
I see your motives inside
Decisions to hide

Back off, I'll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone

I know that you are wrong
Headstrong, we're headstrong
Back off, I'll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone

I know that you are wrong
And this is not where you belong
Where you belong?
(I won't give everything away)

I know, I know all about, I know, I know all about
I know, I know all about, I know, I know all about
Your motives inside and your decision to hide
Back off, I'll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
Headstrong, we're headstrong
Back off, I'll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
And this is not where you belong
Where you belong?
This is not were you belong
