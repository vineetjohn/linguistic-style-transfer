Momma, momma, momma made me the way I am
My face, my eyes, someone turn me up, I'm speaking my mind
And I, and I, I've been wasting lot of time looking in mirrors
And hating on me, but now I like what I see

I know, I know, I never be perfect
I know, I know, but I'm gonna work it
Let go, let go, put your new shoes on
The new you on

We are who we are, who we are, pretty is just a pretty word
And I'm gonna shine like a star, cause I'm the only me in this world
Throw away the books and the magazines, I never gonna look like a beauty queen
We are who we are, who we are, and I'm just doing me, just doing me

And I'm just doing me, just doing me
Momma, momma, momma made me the way I am
She told me I should look up on the world with my head held high
And I, and I, I've been wasting a lot of time looking in mirrors

And hating on me, but now I like what I see
I know, I know, I never be perfect
I know, I know, but I'm gonna work it
Let go, let go, put your new shoes on

The new you on

We are who we are, who we are, pretty is just a pretty word
And I'm gonna shine like a star, cause I'm the only me in this world
Throw away the books and the magazines, I never gonna look like a beauty queen
We are who we are, who we are, and I'm just doing me, just doing me

And I'm just doing me, just doing me
I know, I know, I never be perfect
I know, I know, but I'm gonna work it
