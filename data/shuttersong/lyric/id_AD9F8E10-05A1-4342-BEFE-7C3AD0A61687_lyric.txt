The Sound - The 1975 
Written by：Matthew Healy/George Daniel/Adam Hann/Ross MacDonald 
Well I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
I can't believe I forgot your name
Oh baby won't you cum again
She said I've got a problem with your shoes
And your tunes but I might move in
And I thought you were straight now I'm wondering
You're so conceited I said I love you
What does it matter if I'm lying to you
I don't regret it but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you just don't get it
Cause I know you do
Well I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
It's not about reciprocation it's just all about me
A sycophantic prophetic socratic junkie wanna be
There's so much skin to see
A simple epicurean philosophy
And you say I'm such a cliché
I can't see the difference in it either way
And we left things to protect my mental health
But you'll call me when you're bored and you're playing with yourself
You're so conceited I said I love you
What does it matter if I'm lying to you
I don't regret it but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you just don't get it
Cause I know you
Well I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
