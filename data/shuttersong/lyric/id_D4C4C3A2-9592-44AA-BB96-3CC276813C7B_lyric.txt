Hip hip
When you're on a holiday
You can't find the words to say
All the things that come to you
And i wanna feel it too
On an island in the sun
We'll be playing and having fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can't control my brain
Hip hip
Hip hip
When you're on a golden sea
You don't need no memory
Just a place to call your own
As we drift into the zone
On an island in the sun
We'll be playing and having fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can't control my brain
We'll run away together
We'll spend some time forever
We'll never feel that anymore

We'll never feel that anymore (Hip hip)
No no
