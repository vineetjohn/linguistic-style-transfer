She, she ain't real
She ain't gon' be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all
but baby is that really what you want?

Bless your soul, you got your head in the clouds
She made a fool out of you
and, boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt but you're cold to the core
Now rumour has it, she ain't got your love anymore

Rumour has it
(Rumour)
Rumour has it
(Rumour)
Rumour has it
(Rumour)
Rumour has it
(Rumour)

Rumour has it
(Rumour)
Rumour has it
(Rumour)
Rumour has it
(Rumour)
Rumour has it
(Rumour)

She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you've stayed
I heard you been missing me
You've been telling people things you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out, she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumours?

Bless your soul, you got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me and, boy, I'm bringing you down
You made my heart melt yet I'm cold to the core
But rumour has it I'm the one you're leaving her for

Rumour has it
(Rumour)
Rumour has it
(Rumour)
Rumour has it
(Rumour)
Rumour has it
(Rumour)

Rumour has it
(Rumour)
Rumour has it
(Rumour)
Rumour has it
(Rumour)
Rumour has it
(Rumour)

All of these words whispered in my ear
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it
People say crazy things
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it

Rumour has it
(Rumour)
Rumour has it
(Rumour)
Rumour has it
(Rumour)
Rumour has it
(Rumour)

Rumour has it
(Rumour)
Rumour has it
(Rumour)
Rumour has it
(Rumour)
Rumour has it
(Rumour)

(Rumour)
Rumour has it
(Rumour)
Rumour has it
(Rumour)
Rumour has it
(Rumour)
Rumour has it
(Rumour)
Rumour has it
(Rumour)
Rumour has it

But rumor has it he's the one I'm leaving you for
