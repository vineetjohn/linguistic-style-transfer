There are no words
To paint a picture of you, girl
Your eyes, those curves
It's like you're from some other world
You walk my way

Oh God, it's so frustrating
So why do I disappear when you come near
It makes me feel so small
Why do I blow my lines
Most every time, like I've got no chance at all

If I could be a superman
I'd fly you to the stars and back again
'Cause every time you touch my hand
You feel my powers running through your veins

But I can only write this song
And tell you that I'm not that strong
'Cause I'm no superman
I hope you like me as I am

It ain't no lie
I have to tell you how I feel
But each time that I try
It gets a little more unreal
You walk my way

Oh God, it's so frustating
So why do I disappear
When you come near, it makes me feel so small
If I could read your mind
Girl, would I find any trace of me at all?

If I could be a superman
I'd fly you to the stars and back again
'Cause every time you touch my hand
You feel my powers running through your veins

But I can only write this song
And tell you that I'm not that strong
'Cause I'm no superman
I hope you like me as I am
If I could be a superman
I'd fly you to the stars and back again
'Cause every time you touch my hand
You feel my powers running through your veins
But I can only write this song
And tell you that I'm not that strong
'Cause I'm no superman
I hope you like me as I am
