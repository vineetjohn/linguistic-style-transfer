The Other Side (Bbop & Roksteadi Radio Edit) - Jason Born
In the beginning

I never thought it would be you

When we were chillin'

Smiling in the photo booth

But we got closer yeah

Till you were eating off my spoon

And coming over

And we would talk all afternoon

Tonight we'll just get drunk
Disturb the peace
Bind your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip
Whisper and say
We're going all the way tonight

Take me to the other side

Sparks fly like the fourth of July

Just take me to the other side

I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road
We'll be lovers for sho'
So tonight kiss me like it's do or die

And take me to the other side

This could be perfect

But we won't know unless we try try
I know you're nervous

So just sit back and let me drive

Tonight we'll just get drunk
Disturb the peace

Bind your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip
Whisper and say
We're going all the way tonight

Take me to the other side

Sparks fly like the fourth of July

Take me to the other side

I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road
We'll be lovers for sho'
So tonight kiss me like it's do or die

And take me to the other side woah

Kiss me like it's do or die

And take me to the other side
Tonight we'll just get drunk
Disturb the peace
Let your love crash into me
And then you bite your lip
Whisper and say
We're going all the way

Tonight take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the fourth of July

Take me to the other side

I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know we ain't friends anymore

If we walk down this road
We'll be lovers for sho'
So tonight kiss me like it's do or die

And take me to the other side woah
Take me to the other side
Woah
Take me to the other side
Woah
Kiss me like it's do or die
Woah
And take me to the other side
