I guess for now you've got the last laugh

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listening, or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here

Somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
with this boy who's hollerin' and I can hardly hear
over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you

So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, "What am I doin' here?"
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist
But usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
¡°
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
¡ª Alessia Cara


Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message
(Like we usually do)

And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners

I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more

Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, "What am I doin' here?"

Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talkin' 'bout a hater, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this?
I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, "What am I doin' here?"
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
(Oh oh, oh oh)
