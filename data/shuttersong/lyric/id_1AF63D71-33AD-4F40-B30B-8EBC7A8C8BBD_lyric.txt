 It's Still Rock And Roll To Me
What 's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?
"Can't you tell that your tie 's too wide?"
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars?
"Welcome back  to the age of jive.
Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money."
Everybody 's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but  it 's  still  rock  and  roll  to  me
What 's the matter with the car I'm driving?
"Can't you tell that  it 's out of style?"
Should I get a set of while wall tires?
"Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet 's a true baby blue Continental."
Hot funk, cool punk, even if  it 's old junk
 It 's  still  rock  and  roll  to  me
Oh,  it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
'Cause  it 's always been the same old scene.
There 's a new band in town
But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine...
Aimed at your average teen
How about a pair of pink sidewinders
 And a bright orange pair of pants?
"You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give  it half a chance.
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers,
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers."
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
 It 's  still  rock  and  roll  to  me
What 's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
"Don't you know that they're out of touch?"
Should I try  to be a straight `A' student?
"If you are then you think too much.
Don't you know about the new fashion honey?
All you need are looks  and a whole lotta money."
 It 's the next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
 It 's  still  rock  and  roll  to  me
Everybody 's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but  it 's  still  rock  and  roll  to  me
