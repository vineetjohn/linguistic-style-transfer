Sunny
yesterday my life was filled with rain.
Sunny
you smiled at me and really eased the pain.
Now the dark days are gone
and the bright days are here
My Sunny one shines so sincere.
Sunny one so true
I love you.
Sunny
thank you for the sunshine bouquet.
Sunny
thank you for the love
you brought my way.
You gave to me your all and all.
And now I feel ten feet tall.
Sunny one so true
I love you.
Sunny
thank you for the truth
you let me see.
Sunny
thank you for the facts
from A to Z.
My life was torn
like a wind-blown sand,
And the rock was formed
when you held my hand.
Sunny one so true
I love you.
Sunny
thank you for the smile
upon your face.
Sunny
thank you thank you for the gleam
that shows its grace.
You're my spark
of nature's fire,
You're my sweet
complete desire.
Sunny one so true
yes I love you.
Sunny
yesterday all my life
was filled with rain.
Sunny
you smiled at me and really, really eased the pain.
Now the dark days are gone, and the bright days are here,
My Sunny one
shines so sincere.
Sunny one so true
I love you.
I love you...
