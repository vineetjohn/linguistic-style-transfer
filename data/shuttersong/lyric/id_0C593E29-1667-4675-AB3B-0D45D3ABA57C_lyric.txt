
I can't believe I'm still doing this
I told myself a month ago that I'd be through with this
I'm looking at my phone
And wondering if you're home
I'm kinda tipsy,
I ain't tryna sleep alone

Somebody told me that some other girl was hugging you
Baby, you know I'm the one that should be loving you
You know we had a thing
Baby, it's such a shame
I still get crazy every time I hear your name

And I know it's complicated
But you know I'm impatient

3 AM. Yep, I'm texting you once again
Even though I'm hanging with my friends
And I can't help it, I can't help myself, no
3 AM. I might be looking for a late night friend
And, baby, I can't get you out my head
I can't help it, I can't help myself, no

Kinda stressing like I'm gonna have a heart attack
It's been an hour and you haven't even hit me back,
Baby, keep it real,
Tell me what's the deal
'Cause I miss you. You don't know how this feels

I know it's complicated
This always happens when I'm wasted

3 AM. Yep, I'm texting you once again
Even though I'm hanging with my friends
And I can't help it, I can't help myself, no
3 AM. I might be looking for a late night friend
And, baby, I can't get you out my head
I can't help it, I can't help myself, no

I know, I know, I know
It's so wrong
Somebody take away my phone
'Cause I been drinking all night long, all night long, all night long

I know, I know, I know
It's so wrong
