You were a child crawling on your knees toward it
Making momma so proud but your voice was too loud
We liked to watch you laughing
You picked the insects off plants, no time to think of consequences

Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting to be haunted

The water is warm but it's sending me shivers
A baby is born crying out for attention
The memories fade like looking through a fogged mirror
Decision to decisions are made and not bought
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot, I guess not
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting to be haunted

Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees
