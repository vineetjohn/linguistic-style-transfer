I walked into the party
I seen somethin' I never saw
Everybody was movin', groovin
Girls, they were dancin' on the bar
Now this wasn't no ordinary dance
Hey man why is everybody swimmin' in a trance?
I couldn't figure it out like your grandpa's riddle
I asked 'em what they doing and they said Juicy Wiggle!
(Now move your hips and dance like fish)

Get Juicy
Get Juicy

All those people wigglin' they stuff.
(Hey man, you gonna do the dance?)
Man turn down for what!?
Give me a shot (Woo!)
Another shot (Woo!)
Y'all ain't ready for me to show you what I got. (Woo!)
Then my body froze up, it was getting to my head
What if I can't do it?
Then everybody said...
