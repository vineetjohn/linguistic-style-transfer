 I'm in the deep end, cannonball jump
Thinking of your love and my heart beats like a drum
Not feeling guilty, cause  the water's just right
Oh, it might be wrong, might be  the time of your life
So jump on  in with me
Let me set you free
 I'll make you feel like you're dreaming
Try try try, to follow  the rules
 I break everyone of them with boys like you
My oh my, doing what  I always do
Yea  I 'm crossing every line to get to boys like you
Boys like you, you, tripping, freaking falling over boys like you
It's getting hot out under that summer sun
 I 'm not playing games,  I 'm just a girl having fun
 I need to cool down, cause  I know we're just friends
But one look from you baby then  I 'm falling back  in
What's a girl to do?
 I got it mad for you
You make me feel like  I 'm dreaming
Try try try, to follow  the rules
 I break everyone of them with boys like you
My oh my, doing what  I always do
Yea  I 'm crossing every line to get to boys like you
Boys like you, you, tripping, freaking falling over boys like you
 I get a feeling, looking you  in  the eye
Know you wanna take a bite of my cherry pie
Get so excited, boy you¡¯re making me blush
Let's just take our time now, there ain't no need to rush, no
Why don't you make a move?
You got nothing else to lose
Just make me feel like  I 'm dreaming
Try try try, to follow  the rules
 I break everyone of them with boys like you
My oh my, doing what  I always do
Yea  I 'm crossing every line to get to boys like you
Boys like you, you, tripping, freaking falling over boys like you
 I got that something  I know you can't resist
 I 'm gonna make you feel it when  I blow you that kiss
