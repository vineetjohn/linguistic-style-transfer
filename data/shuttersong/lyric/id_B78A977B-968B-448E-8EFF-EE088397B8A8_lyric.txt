Trouble he will find you no matter where you go, oh oh.
No matter if you're fast no matter if you're slow, oh oh.
The eye of the storm or the cry in the mourn, oh oh.
You're fine for a while but you start to loose control.

He's there in the dark
He's there in my heart
He waits in the winds
He's gotta play a part.

Trouble is a friend

Yeah trouble is a friend of mine. Oh oh!
Trouble is a friend but trouble is a foe, oh oh.
And no matter what I feed him he always seems to grow, oh oh.

He sees what I see and he knows what I know, oh oh.
So don't forget as you ease on down the road.
He's there in the dark
He's there in my heart
He waits in the winds
He's gotta play a part.

Trouble is a friend
Yeah trouble is a friend of mine. Oh oh!

So don't be alarmed if he takes you by the arm.

I won't let him win, but I'm a sucker for his charm.
Trouble is a friend
Yeah trouble is a friend of mine. Oh oh!

Oh how I hate the way he makes me feel.
And how I try to make him leave; I try.

Oh Oh I try!
But he's there in the dark
He's there in my heart
He waits in the winds
He's gotta play a part.
Trouble is a friend
Yeah trouble is a friend of mine. Oh oh!
So don't be alarmed if he takes you by the arm.
I won't let him win, but I'm a sucker for his charm.
Trouble is a friend
Yeah trouble is a friend of mine. Oh oh!
