When we were young, we used to get so close to it and you were scared and you were beautiful
I wanna peer over the edge and see in death if we are always the same
Oh, I fear that no life will ever be like this again

Cause your love kept me alive and it made me insane (oh, yeah)
There were moments when it seemed okay (But I go back alone)
Where do you go? Oh, where do you stay? (I go back alone)
There was a time when the music would play (Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Oh, baby, every morning there are mountains to climb
Taking all my time
Oh, when I get up, this is what I see

Welcome to reality
Oh, baby, every morning there are mountains to climb

Taking all my time
Oh, when I get up, this is what I see
Welcome to reality
