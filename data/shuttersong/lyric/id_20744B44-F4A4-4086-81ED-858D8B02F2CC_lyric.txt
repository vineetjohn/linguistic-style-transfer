Oath (feat  Becky G)  Oath (feat  Becky G) - Single  Cher Lloyd
Yo  my best friend  best friend til the very end
Cause best friends  best friends don't have to pretend
You need a hand  and i'm right there right beside you
You in the dark  i'll be the bright light to guide you
'Member the times  times  times sneaking of the house
All of the times  times  times that you had the doubts
And don't forget all the trouble we got into
We got something you can't undo  do
Laughing so damn hard
Crashed your dad's new car
All the scars we share
I Promise  I swear
Wherever you go  just always remember
That you got a home for now and forever
And if you get low  just call me whenever
This is my oath to you
Wherever you go  just always remember
You never alone  we're birds of a feather
And we'll never change  no matter the weather
This is my oath to you
I know I drive you crazy  mm  sometimes
I know I called you lazy  and that's most times
But you complete me  and that's no lie
You are my tuxedo  and i'm your bow tie
We in the car  sing  sing  singing our song
Rocking the building  tear it down  like we king kong
And in my eyes  you can't do  do no wrong
You got the best friends sing  sing along
Laughing so damn hard
Crashed your dad's new car
All the scars we share
I Promise  I swear
Wherever you go  just always remember
That you got a home for now and forever
And if you get low  just call me whenever
This is my oath to you
Wherever you go  just always remember
You never alone  we're birds of a feather
And we'll never change  no matter the weather
This is my oath to you
I'll never let you go
Woah  this is my oath to you
Just thought that you should know
Woah  this is my oath to you
Yeah   
Wherever you go  just always remember
That you got a home for now and forever
And if you get low  just call me whenever
This is my oath to you
Wherever you go  just always remember
You never alone  we're birds of a feather
And we'll never change  no matter the weather
This is my oath to you
You should know  you should know  you should know
Woah  this is my oath to you
You never alone  we're birds of a feather
Woah  this is my oath to you
