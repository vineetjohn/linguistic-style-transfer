I've been roaming around
always looking down and all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach

You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you
and all you know and how you speak

Countless lovers
undercover of the street
You know that I could use somebody

You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you
(ooo, ooo)
(ooo, ooo)

(ooo, ooo)
Off in the night while you live it up
I'm off to sleep

Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice
I hope it's gonna make you notice

Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me, somebody
Im ready now
I'm ready now
I'm ready now
I'm ready now
Someone like you, somebody
Someone like you, somebody
Someone like you, somebody
I've been roaming around
always looking down and all I see
