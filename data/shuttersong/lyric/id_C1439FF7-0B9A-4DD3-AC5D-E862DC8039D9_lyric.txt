Rather Be - Clean Bandit/Jess Glynne
Written by£ºGrace Chatto/James Napier
We're a thousand miles from comfort we have traveled land and sea
But as long as you are with me there's no place I'd rather be
I would wait forever exalted in the scene
As long as I am with you my heart continues to beat
With every step we take Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so casually
We're different and the same get you another name
Switch up the batteries
If you gave me a chance I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart you can't shake me
When I am with you there's no place I'd rather be
N n no no no place I'd rather be
N n no no no place I'd rather be
N n no no no place I'd rather be
We staked out on a mission to find our inner peace
Make it everlasting so nothing's incomplete
It's easy being with you sacred simplicity
As long as we're together there's no place I'd rather be
With every step we take Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so casually
We're different and the same get you another name
Switch up the batteries
If you gave me a chance I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart you can't shake me
When I am with you there's no place I'd rather be
N n no no no place I'd rather be
N n no no no place I'd rather be
N n no no no place I'd rather be
When I am with you there's no place I'd rather be
Be be be be be be be be be
If you gave me a chance I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart you can't shake me
When I am with you there's no place I'd rather be
N n no no no place I'd rather be
N n no no no place I'd rather be
N n no no no place I'd rather be
When I am with you there's no place I'd rather be
