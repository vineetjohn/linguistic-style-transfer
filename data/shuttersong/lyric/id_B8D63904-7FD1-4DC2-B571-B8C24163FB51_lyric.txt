Replay

Remember the first time we met
You was at the mall wit yo friend
I was scared to approach ya
But then you came closer
Hopin' you would give me a chance

Who would have ever knew
That we would ever be more than friends
We're real worldwide, breakin' all the rules
She like a song played again and again

That girl
Like somethin' off a poster
That girl
Is a dime they say
That girl
Is the gun to my holster
She's runnin' through my mind all day

See you been all around the globe
Not once did you leave my mind
We talk on the phone, from night til the morn
Girl you really changed my life

Doin' things I never do
I'm in the kitchin cookin' things she likes
We're real worldwide, breakin' all the rules
Someday I wanna make you my wife

Like somethin' off a poster
That girl
Is a dime they say

Is the gun to my holster
