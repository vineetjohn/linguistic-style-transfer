How long will it take?
Have I got time for a shower?
You could jump on the blue line
Take a bus from the station
And I'll meet you out there
Get a drink, if that's alright

Don't care what we do
'Cause the night is ours
As long as we do
What we're doing for hours
How long will it take?
Have I got time for a shower?
You could jump on the blue line

I could wait all night, -ight, -ight, I
I could wait all night, -ight, -ight, I

I hope that the Traffic Lights don't change
Keeping me away from you
I hope that the Traffic Lights don't change
Wherever I lose
And I hope that you're
Gonna get there soon
I hope that the Traffic Lights don't change
Keeping me away from you

It's cold outside
I've been waiting for an hour
But it's feeling like forever

I put my best dress on
With a low-cut top
Got some new shoes on and sweater

And every passing car leaves me wondering
Did you read me wrong?
Whats happening?
I hear the driver say:
"Go the other way,
And look for something better",
I hope  that the Traffic Lights don't change,
Keeping me away from you,
I hope  that the Traffic Lights don't change,
Wherever I move,
And I hope  that you're,
Gonna  get there soon,
I hope  that the Traffic Lights don't change,
Keeping me away from you,
I could wait all night, -ight, -ight, I,
I could wait all night, -ight, -ight, I,
I could wait all ni-, i-, i-, i-, i-, i-, i-, i-, i-,
I could wait all ni-, i-, i-, i-, i-, i-,
I hope  that the Traffic Lights don't change,
Keeping me away from you,
I hope  that the Traffic Lights don't change,
Wherever I move,
And I hope  that you're,
Gonna  get there soon,
I hope  that the Traffic Lights don't change,
Keeping me away from you
