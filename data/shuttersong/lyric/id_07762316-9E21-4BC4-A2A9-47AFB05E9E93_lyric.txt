
I was born in a thunderstorm
I grew up overnight
I played alone
I'm playing on my own
I survived

Hey
I wanted everything I never had
Like the love that comes with light
I wore envy and I hated that
But I survived

I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go
Where the wind don't change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
No hope, just lies
And you're taught to cry into your pillow
But I survived

I'm still breathing [4x]
I'm alive [4x]

I found solace in the strangest place
Way in the back of my mind
I saw my life in a stranger's face
And it was mine

I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go
Where the wind don't change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
No hope, just lies
And you're taught to cry into your pillow
But I survived

I'm still breathing [4x]
I'm alive [4x]

You took it all, but I'm still breathing [8x]

I have made every single mistake
That you could ever possibly make
I took and I took and I took what you gave
But you never noticed that I was in pain
I knew what I wanted; I went out and got it
Did all the things that you said that I wouldn't
I told you that I would never be forgotten
And all in spite of you

And I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing
I'm alive (You took it out, but I'm still breathing)
(You took it out, but I'm still breathing)
I'm alive (You took it out, but I'm still breathing)
(You took it out, but I'm still breathing)
I'm alive (You took it out, but I'm still breathing)
(You took it out, but I'm still breathing)
I'm alive

I'm alive 
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
