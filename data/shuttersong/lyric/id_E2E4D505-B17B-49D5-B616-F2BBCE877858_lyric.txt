I don't understand, I do all this for you
You contemplating on me or is it him?
Or is it me? Or is it him?

He told you he'd be there for you and he wasn't
I told you I'd be there for you and I was
And still is the real is who takes care of biz
Took you from apartments and got you home like the wiz

I'm not the kind of guy to give you everything
But if you're real then you can get some ice in your rings
You and me straight to the crib off the tour bus
Spottin' my eyes fireplace big as us

It really don't matter, who's first in the shower
Fruit platter from a young maid every hour
And when it comes down to the dollar
You can have it all ya gotta do is keep it hoppin' like a rabbit

Friends come around don't be ready to change
Treat me like a stepchild when I'm up on my game
Remember I'm the first to give your cootie the pain
So I wanna hear you answer when I ask you my name

Ooh baby I want you here with me
And give you everything that your heart desires
Lady can you feel me?
Do you wanna be with me for always?

Baby can't you see what you've done to me?
When he do the things that he has done to you baby

You don't need nobody to love you
You don't need nobody to kiss you
You don't need nobody to please you
'Cuz I can do those things if I'm with you

Now who took you in when that nigga put you out?
And who picked you up when that nigga put you down?
Restraining orders keep that fool from around
Had to set you up in a spot downtown

See I was the one who was there for you
But I'm not the one gonna play the two
Channel bags in the trunk, what you gon' do?
You could treat the future like a menu

As long as I'm the only one to bend you
And when you wanna take a flight I'm the one to send you
Never be the one that's out to hurt you
Tell you that I'm there and then desert you

You don't need nobody to love you
You don't need nobody to kiss you
You don't need nobody to please you
'Cuz I can do those things if I'm with you

You don't need nobody to love you
You don't need nobody to kiss you
You don't need nobody to please you
'Cuz I can do those things if I'm with you

Baby, can't you see what you've done to me?
When he do the things he do to you, baby

You don't need nobody to love you
You don't need nobody to kiss you
You don't need nobody to please you
'Cuz I can do those things if I'm with you

You don't need nobody to love you
You don't need nobody to kiss you
You don't need nobody to please you
'Cuz I can do those things if I'm with you

You don't need nobody to love you
You don't need nobody to kiss you
You don't need nobody to please you
'Cuz I can do those things if I'm with you

You don't need nobody to love you
You don't need nobody to kiss you
You don't need nobody to please you
