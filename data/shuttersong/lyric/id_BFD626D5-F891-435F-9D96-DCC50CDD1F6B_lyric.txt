Across the ocean, across the sea
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes
Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps in the road and upside down now
I know it's hard babe to sleep at night
Don't you worry, cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright

Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry, cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright

All along in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
For you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms holding my heart
Oh I, oh I, I love you
And everything's gonna be alright
Be alright

Through the long nights and the bright lights
Don't you worry, cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright

You know that I care for you, I'll always be there for you
I promise I'll just stay right here
I know that you want me to, baby we can make it through
Anything, cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright

Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry, cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright

Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry, cause everything's gonna be alright
