Girl I see it in your eyes you're disappointed
'Cause I'm the foolish one that you anointed with your heart
I tore it apart

And girl what a mess I made upon your innocence
And no woman in the world deserves this
But here I am asking you for one more chance

Can we fall, one more time?
Stop the tape and rewind
Oh, and if you walk away I know I'll fade
'Cause there is nobody else

It's gotta be you
Only you
It's gotta be you
Oh, only you

Now girl I hear it in your voice and how it trembles
When you speak to me I don't resemble, who I was
You've almost had enough

And your actions speak louder than words
And you're about to break from all you've heard
But don't be scared, I ain't going no where

I'll be here, by your side
No more fears, no more crying
But if you walk away, I know I'll fade
'Cause there is nobody else

It's gotta be you
Only you
It's gotta be you
Oh, only you

Oh girl, can we try one more, one more time?
One more, one more, can we try?
One more, one more time
I'll make it better
One more, one more, can we try?
One more, one more
Can we try one more time to make it all better?

'Cause it's gotta be you
It's gotta be you
Oh, only you
Only you

It's gotta be you
Only you
It's gotta be you
Oh, only you
