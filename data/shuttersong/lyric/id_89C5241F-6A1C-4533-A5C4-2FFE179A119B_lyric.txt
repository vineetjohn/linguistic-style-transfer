I'm gonna steal a silver stallion
With not a mark upon his silky hide
Teach him he can trust me like a sister
One day we'll saddle up and ride

And we're gonna ride
We're gonna ride
Ride like the one-eyed Jack of Diamonds
With the Devil close behind
We're gonna ride
We're gonna ride...

I'm gonna find me a reckless man
Razor blades and ice in his eyes
Just a touch of sadness in his fingers
Thunder and lightning in his thighs

And we're gonna ride
We're gonna ride
Ride like the one-eyed Jack of Diamonds
With the Devil close behind
We're gonna ride
We're gonna ride...

I'm gonna chase the sky forever
With the man, the stallion and the wind
The sun is gonna burn into a cinder
Before we ever pass this way again

And we're gonna ride
We're gonna ride
Ride like the one-eyed Jack of Diamonds
With the Devil close behind
We're gonna ride
We're gonna ride...
