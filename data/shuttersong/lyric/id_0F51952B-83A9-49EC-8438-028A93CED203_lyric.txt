Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can give it all away if he won't be here next year

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
Let it snow, is blasting now
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's true love
That he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can give it all away if he won't be here next year

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But in New Year's day I woke up and you wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's true love
That he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can give it all away if he won't be here next year

Oh, I wanna have him beside me like, ooh
On the 25th, by the fireplace, ooh
But I don't want no broken heart
This year I've got to be smart

Oh, baby
Santa, tell me
Santa, tell me
Santa, tell me
If he will be here

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can give it all away if he won't be here next year
