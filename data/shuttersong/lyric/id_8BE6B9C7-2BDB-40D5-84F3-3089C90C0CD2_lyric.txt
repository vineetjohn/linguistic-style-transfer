All I need is a little love in my life
All I need is a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart

Yeah...

Shot gun, aim at my heart, you got one
Tear me apart in this song
How do we call this love
I tried, to run away but your eyes
Tell me to stay a while
Why do we call this love

It seems like we've been losing control
So bad it don't mean I'm not alone
When I say

All I need is a little love in my life
All I need is a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart

Maybe some part of you just hates me
You pick me and play me
How do we call this love
One time tell me you need me tonight
To make it easy, you lie
And say it's all for love

It seems like we've been losing control
So bad it don't mean I'm not alone
When I say

All I need is a little love in my life
All I need is a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart

Me and my broken
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Me and my broken
Yeah, yeah, yeah
How do we call this

It's just me
It's just me
It's just me
Me and my broken heart
All I need is a little love in my life
All I need is a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
