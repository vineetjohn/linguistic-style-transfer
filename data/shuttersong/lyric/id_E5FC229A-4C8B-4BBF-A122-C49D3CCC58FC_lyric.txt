Invisible - 5 Seconds Of Summer
Another day of painted walls and football on the TV
No one sees me
I fade away  lost inside a memory of someone's life
It wasn't mine
I was already missing before the night I left
Just me and my shadow and all of my regrets
Who am I  Who am I when I don't know myself 
Who am I  Who am I  Invisible
Wasted days  dreaming of the times I know I can't get back
It seems I just lost track
Looking on as all of life's colours seem to fade to grey
I just walked away
I was already missing before the night I left
Just me and your shadow and all of my regrets
Who am I  Who am I when I don't know myself 
Who am I  Who am I  Invisible
Who am I  Who am I when I don't know myself 
Who am I  Who am I  Invisible
Who am I  Who am I when I don't know myself 
Who am I  Who am I  Invisible
Another day  the walls are built to keep me safe
I can't escape  it's too late
