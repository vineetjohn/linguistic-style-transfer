JR! Sean Kingston!
You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal, suicidal

When you say it's over.
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt

They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over
See it started at the park
Used to chill after dark

Oh when you took my heart
That's when we fell apart
Cause we both thought

That love lasts forever (lasts forever)
They say we're too young
To get ourselves sprung
Oh we didn't care

We made it very clear
And they also said
That we couldn't last together (last together)
See it's very define girl

one of a kind
But you mash up my mind
You have to get declined

Oh Lord...
My baby is driving me crazy
You're way too beautiful girl

That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over

Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

It was back in '99
Watchin' movies all the time
Oh when I went away
For doin' my first crime
And I never thought
That we was gonna see each other (see each other)
And then I came out
Mami moved me down South
Oh I'm with my girl
Who I thought was my world
It came out to be
That she wasn't the girl for me (girl for me)
See it's very define girl
one of a kind
But you mash up my mind
You have to get declined
Oh Lord...
My baby is driving me crazy
You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over
Now we're fussin'
And now we're fightin'
Please tell me why
I'm feelin' slighted
And I don't know
How to make it better (make it better)
You're datin' other guys
You're tellin' me lies
Oh I can't believe
What I'm seein' with my eyes
I'm losin' my mind
And I don't think it's clever (think it's clever)
You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal, suicidal, when they say its over...
