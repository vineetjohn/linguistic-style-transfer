So your friends been telling me
You been sleeping with my sweater
And that you can't stop missing me
Bet my friends been telling you
I'm not doing much better
'Cause I'm missing half of me

And bein' here without you
Is like I'm wakin' up to

Only half a blue sky
Kind of there, but not quite
I'm walking around with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a man at best
With half an arrow in my chest
I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you

Forget all we said that night
No, it doesn't even matter
'Cause we both got split in two

If you could spare an hour or so
We'll go for lunch down by the river
We can really talk it through

And bein' here without you
Is like I'm wakin' up to

Only half a blue sky
Kind of there, but not quite
I'm walking around with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a man at best
With half an arrow in my chest
'Cause I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you

Half a heart without you
I'm a half a heart without you

Though I try to get you out of my head
The truth is I got lost without you
And since then I've been wakin' up to

Only half a blue sky (only half a blue sky)
Kind of there, but not quite
I'm walking around with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a man at best (half a man at best)
With half an arrow in my chest
I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you

Without you, without you
Half a heart without you
Without you, without you

I'm half a heart without you
