I'm gonna love ya
I wish you were my first love
We fell in love
Fall in love
Drunk in love
Wave after wave
I don't know where the lights are taking us
And I'll write your name
I will never let you down
I'm only human
I'm all about that bass, ‘bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that (3), ‘bout that (2), ‘bout that (1), ‘bout that

POP DANTHOLOGY

I stay up too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say
That's what people say (it might seem crazy what I'm about to say)
You're like a drug that's killing me
I cut you out entirely
But I get so high when I'm inside you

Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do (following, following, following)

You say I'm crazy
‘Cause you don't think I know what you've done (these girls ain't loyal)
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

Talk dirty to me

Turn down for what

I can read your body language

Ah la la la

Leggo

What are you gonna do
This is how we do
So what are you gonna do
This is how we do

You know the words to my songs
No habla ingles
Girls hit your hallelujah
Girls hit your hallelujah
Our conversations ain't long
But you know what is
Girls hit your hallelujah
‘Cause Uptown Funk gon' give it to ya
‘Cause Uptown Funk gon' give it to ya
‘Cause Uptown Funk gon' give it to ya
Saturday night and we in the spot
Don't believe me just watch

Oh oh oh ooh oh

Don't believe me just watch

Louder

Sing

I'm so confused

‘Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love never felt so good
She came to give it to you

Say it ain't what you do cause…
(Oh my gosh, look at her butt)

So if you knew what I knew
She'd be yours tonight
(Look at her butt)

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you (hey)

When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more

(There's no going back)

Say something, I'm giving up on you
Yeah, you never said a word
You didn't send me no letter
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you (you)
Why you gotta be so rude?
Been trying so hard not to let it show
Nobody else needs to know
If one thing I know, I'll fall but I'll grow
I'm walking down this road of mine, this road that I call home
So am I wrong

Boy, when you're with me
I'll give you a taste
Make it like your birthday everyday
I wanna be like Kanye
Do what I want, I'll have it my way
Yeah no matter what you say

I know you like it sweet
So you can have your cake
Give you something good to celebrate
I wanna be like Kanye
Kanye, yeah yeah-ah, yeah-ah
Bang bang into the room
Can't remember to forget you
Bang bang all over you
Yeah you always make me go
Like Kanye
You're just a hideaway
Kanye, yeah yeah-ah, yeah-ah
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
I'm bringing booty back
This is the part when I break free
Don't blame it on me
There's no place I'd rather be
Oh won't you stay with me
I tried to let it go
Let it go, let it go
I tried to let it go
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Yeah yeah-ah, yeah-ah
