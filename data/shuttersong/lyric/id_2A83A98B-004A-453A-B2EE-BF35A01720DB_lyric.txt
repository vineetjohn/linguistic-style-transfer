Riders on the storm 
　　Riders on the strom 
　　Into this house we're born 
　　Into this world we're thrown 
　　Like a dog without a bone 
　　An actor out on loan 
　　Riders on the storm
　　There's a killer on the road 
　　His brain is squirming like a toad
　　Take a long holiday 
　　Let your children play 
　　If you give this man a ride 
　　Sweet family will die 
　　Killer on the road 
　　Girl you gotta love your man 
　　Girl you gotta love your man 

Take him by the hand 
　　Make him understand 
　　The world on you depends 
　　Our life will never end 
　　You gotta love your man 
　　Riders on the storm 
　　Riders on the storm 
　　Into this house we're born 
　　Into this world we're thrown 
　　Like a dog without a bone 
　　An actor out on loan 
　　Riders on the storm 
　　Riders on the storm 
　　Riders on the storm 
　　Riders on the storm
