Elvis is my daddy, Marilyn¡¯s my mother,
Jesus is my bestest friend.
We don¡¯t need nobody
'Cause we got each other,
Or at least I pretend.

We get down every Friday night,
Dancin¡¯ and grindin¡¯ in the pale moonlight.
Grand Ole Opry, we're feelin¡¯ alright,
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind.
(I said don't worry about it)

[Chorus:]
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric,
Sing that body electric,
Sing that body electric.
I¡¯m on fire,
Sing that body electric.

Whitman is my daddy, Monaco¡¯s my mother,
Diamonds are my bestest friend.
Heaven is my baby, suicide¡¯s her father,
Opulence is the end.

We get down every Friday night,
Dancin¡¯ and grindin¡¯ in the pale moonlight.
Grand Ole Opry, we're feelin¡¯ alright,
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind.
(I said don't worry about it)

[Chorus:]
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric,
Sing that body electric,
Sing that body electric.
I¡¯m on fire,
Sing that body electric.

My clothes still smell like you,
And all the photographs say you¡¯re still young.
I pretend I¡¯m not hurt
And go about the world like I¡¯m havin¡¯ fun.

We get crazy every Friday night,
Drop it like it¡¯s hot in the pale moonlight.
Grand Ole Opry, feelin' all right
Mary's swayin¡¯ softly to her heart's delight.

I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric,
Sing that body electric,
Sing that body electric.
I¡¯m on fire,
Sing that body electric.
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric, baby.
