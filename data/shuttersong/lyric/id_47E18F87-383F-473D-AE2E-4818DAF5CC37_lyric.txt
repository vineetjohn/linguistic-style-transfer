
But I'm lonely
Negative relations

I've been hurt so many times
I don't have the patience

But I've wished for so long
For someone to come and show me
Lead by example
'Cause I've been waiting

I've tried every age
I'm so tired of the game
I wanna be somebody's girl
Would you show me the way?

What if I never find and I'm left behind?

Should I keep hoping for love?
What if I'm still the same?
Status doesn't change?
Gotta keep hoping for love

What is love?
What is love?
What is love?

Somebody show me
What is love?
What is love?
What is love?
'Cause if you told me
What is love?

What is love?
What is love?
I wouldn't be lonely
What is love?
Please show me
What is love?

I've had blind dates
Hooked up with some real flakes
I've gone out with church boys
Musician's are the worst

I've tried so hard
'Cause I'm just so die hard
Tried my best to play the part
Wish you could see inside

But I've wished for so long

For someone to come and show me
Lead by example
'Cause I've been waiting
I've tried every age
I'm so tired of the game
I wanna be somebody's girl
Would you show me the way?

What if I never find and I'm left behind?
Should I keep hoping for love?
What if I'm still the same?
Status doesn't change?
Gotta keep hoping for love

What is love?
What is love?
What is love?
Somebody show me
What is love?
What is love?
What is love?
'Cause if you told me
What is love?
What is love?
What is love?
I wouldn't be lonely
What is love?
Please show me
What is love?

I've been alone
For the past three years
On Valentine's Day
Christmas is no exception
Birthday's with naughty presents
Been back and forth, same action
I just need this to happen
I'll be singing love's praises
If you would show me

What if I never find and I'm left behind?
Should I keep hoping for love?
What if I'm still the same?
Status doesn't change?
Gotta keep hoping for love

What is love?
What is love?
What is love?
Somebody show me
What is love?
What is love?
What is love?
'Cause if you told me
What is love?
What is love?
What is love?
I wouldn't be lonely
What is love?
Please show me
What is love?
