Here we are, with our backs against the wall.
We've got big city dreams, but we don't move from the asphalt.
We run away, from our own imagination.
But at the same time, we've got this amazing fascination.
We've got hopes on the horizons.
We can't stop from climbing the mountain.
We're sick and tired of keeping silent.
We are, we are, we are,
We are gonna come together.
We're gonna come together now.
We are gonna run together.
We're gonna turn it upside down.
'Cause with the smoke in the mirror, I can see your face.
So, let's run to the fire escape.
Come together, we're gonna come together now.
Who are they, with their so-called innovations?
They hold on, like they found their own salvation.
They shy away, from the slightest alteration.
But at the same time, we've got the same fascinations.
We've got hopes on the horizon.
We can't stop from climbing the mountain.
We're sick and tired of keeping silent.
We are, we are, we are,
We are gonna come together.
We're gonna come together now.
We are gonna run together.
We're gonna turn it upside down.
'Cause with the smoke in the mirror, I can see your face.
So, let's run to the fire escape.
Come together, we're gonna come together now.
Just let go, it's a free fall.
We're almost home, it's a free fall.
We are gonna come together.
We're gonna come together now.
We are gonna run together.
We're gonna turn it upside down.
We are gonna come together.
We're gonna come together now.
We are gonna run together.
We're gonna turn it upside down.
'Cause with the smoke in the mirror, I can see your face.
So, let's run to the fire escape.
Come together, we're gonna come together now.
