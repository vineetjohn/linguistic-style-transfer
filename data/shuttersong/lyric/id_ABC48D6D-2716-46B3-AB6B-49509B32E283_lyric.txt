Am I just a fool?
Blind and stupid for loving you
Am I just a silly girl?
So young and naive, to think you were
the one
who came to take claim of this heart

Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just a frame in the dark
And now the people
the people are talking
the people are saying that you have been playing my heart
like a grand piano
The people are talking, the people are saying
that you have been playing my heart

like a grand piano

So play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on
Am I queen of fools?

Wrapped up in lies and foolish jewels
What do I see in you?

Maybe I'm addicted to all the things you do
Cause I keep thinking you were
the one who came to take claim of this heart
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just a frame in the dark
the people are talking, the people are saying
that you have been playing my heart, like a grand piano
The people are talking, the people are saying
that you have been playing my heart like, a grand piano
So play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on
