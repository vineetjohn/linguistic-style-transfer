Monday had a sad child
Always feeling low down
Tuesday had a dream child
She's always on the go
So I'm in love with Saturday's child

Every time you take her out at night
 (She drives me wild)
You want to kiss and hold her way up tight
 (Gonna spend my time)
You can tell the future's looking bright
 (Making sure that Saturday's child is mine)

If you love a Wednesday
You live your life apart now
And if you love a Thursday
She's gonna break your heart
So I'm in love with Saturday's child

Every time you hold her close you'll see
 (She drives me wild)
You can feel the thrill that's gonna be
 (Gonna spend my time)
Now the future has a guarantee
 (Making sure that Saturday's child is mine)

Seven days of the week made to choose from
But only one is right for me
I know that Saturday's got what it takes, babe
I can tell by the way she looks at me

Friday likes the good life
She'll take you for a ride now
And Sunday makes a good wife
She wants to be your bride
So I'm in love with Saturday's child

Every time you take her out at night
 (She drives me wild)
You want to kiss and hold her way up tight
 (Gonna spend my time)
You can tell the future's looking bright
 (Making sure that Saturday's child is mine, Saturday's child)

Every time you take her out at night
 (She drives me wild)
You want to kiss and hold her way up tight
 (Gonna spend my time)
You can tell the future's looking bright
 (Making sure that Saturday's child is mine, Saturday's child)
