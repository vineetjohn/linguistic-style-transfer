Up on Melancholy Hill
There's a plastic tree.
Are you here with me?
Just looking out on the day

Of another dream
Well you can't get what you want
But you can get me.
So let's set out to sea

'Cause you are my medicine
When you're close to me
When you're close to me
So calling all submarines

'Round the world we'll go.
Does anybody know, love

If we're looking out on the day
Of another dream?
If you can't get what you want
Then come with me.
Up on Melancholy Hill
Sits a manatee
Just looking out on the day
When you're close to me.
When you're close to me.
When you're close to me.
