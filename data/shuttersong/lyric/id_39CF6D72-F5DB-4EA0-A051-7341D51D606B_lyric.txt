Taking hold, breaking in
The pressure's on, need to circulate
Mesmerized and taken in
Moving slow, so it resonates
It's time to rest, not to sleep away
My thoughts alone, try to complicate
I'll do my best, to seek you out
And be myself, and not impersonate

I tried so hard to not walk away
And when things don't go my way
I'll still carry on and on just the same

I've always been strong
But can't make this happen
'Cause I need to breathe, I want to breathe you in
The fear of becoming
I'm so to tired of running
Cause I need to breathe, I want to breathe you in
I want to breathe you in

I'm going in, so cover me
Your compass will, help me turn the page
The laughing stock I'll never be
Because I won't let them take me

I tried so hard to not walk away
And when things don't go my way
I'll still carry on and on just the same

I've always been strong
But can't make this happen
'Cause I need to breathe, I want to breathe you in
The fear of becoming
I'm so tired of running
Cause I need to breathe...

Took awhile to see all the love that's around me
Through the highs and lows there's a truth that I know
And it's You

Yeah yeah yeah yeah I, I've always been strong
But can't make this happen
'Cause I need to breathe, I want to breathe you in
The fear of becoming
I'm so tired of running
Cause I need to breathe, I want to breathe you in
I want to breathe you in
I want to breathe you in
I want to breathe you in
I want to...
I want to...
I want to breathe you in
I want to breathe you in
I want to breathe...
I want to...
I want to...
I want to breathe (I want to breathe you in, I want to breathe you in)
I want to breathe (I want to breathe you in, I want to, I want to)
I want to breathe (I want to breathe you in, I want to breathe you in)
I want to breathe (I want to breathe)
