We are all living the same way, the same way
We are escaping the same way, the same way
Circling
We are a part of the same play, same play
We think we're making our own way, own way
Circling

You don't have to hold your head up high

Round and round
I won't run away this time
Till you show me what this life is for
Round and round
I'm not gonna let you change my mind
Till you show me what this life is for

We are afflicted by fiction, by fiction
Building a case for eviction, eviction
Circling
Guarding a tower of ancients, of ancients
Shooting down arrows of patience, of patience
And patiently circling

You don't have to hold your head up high

Round and round
I won't run away this time
Till you show me what this life is for
Round and round
I'm not gonna let you change my mind
Till you show me what this life is for

All the emptiness inside you
Is hard enough to fill
Without a sense of purpose
Were setting up to fail
You don't have to make it right
Just hold your head up high

Round and round
I won't run away this time
Till you show me what this life is for
Round and round
I'm not gonna let you change my mind
Till you show me what this life is for
