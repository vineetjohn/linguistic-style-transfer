Kristoff: Really? I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat...
Olaf: Nope!

But sometimes I like to close my eyes
and imagine what it'd be like when summer does come
Bees'll buzz, kids'll blow dandelion fuzz

And I'll be doin' whatever snow does in summer
A drink in my hand, my snow up against the burning sand
Prob'ly getting gorgeously tanned in summer
I'll finally see a summer breeze, blow away a winter storm

And find out what happens to solid water when it gets warm!
And I can't wait to see, what my buddies all think of me
Just imagine how much cooler I'll be in summer
Da da, da doo, ah bah bah bah bah bah boo

The hot and the cold are both so intense

Put' em together — it just makes sense!
R-r-r-ratdadat dad dada doo

Winter's a good time to stay in and cuddle

But put me in summer and I'll be a — happy snowman!
When life gets rough, I like to hold on to my dream
of relaxing in the summer sun, just lettin' off steam
Oh the sky will be blue, and you guys'll be there too
When I finally do what frozen things do in summer!
Kristoff: I'm gonna' tell him —
Anna: Don't you dare!
Olaf: In summer!
