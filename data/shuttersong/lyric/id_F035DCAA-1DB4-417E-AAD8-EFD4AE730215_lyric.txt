Roll up your sleeves
And face the faces looking right back at me
It's easier to leave it all
It's easier to fake it, oh oh

So I go and I took the free
'Cause people there, they're just like me

Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright

Oh, they're hunting me
And he is not fancy, he just wares black
Head to tall

And oh, they're hunting me
So I go and I change my name
But they're chasing those just like me

Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright

Roll up your sleeves
And roll up your sleeves
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright

Everything is gonna be alright
