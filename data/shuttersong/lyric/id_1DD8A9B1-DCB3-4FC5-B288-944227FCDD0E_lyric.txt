 My lover's got humor
She 's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody 's disapproval
I should've worshiped her sooner
If the Heavens ever did speak
She 's the last true mouth piece
Every Sunday 's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it
 My church offers no absolutes
She tells me 'worship in the bedroom'
The only heaven I'll be sent to
 Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well
Amen. Amen. Amen
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog
at the shrine of your life
I'll tell you  my sins
and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless heaven
Good god, let me give you  my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog
at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you  my sins
and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good god, let me give you  my life
If I'm a pagan of the good times
 My  lover 's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on  my side
She demands a sacrifice
To drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That 's a fine looking high horse
What you  got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This  is hungry work
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog
at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you  my sins
so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me  my deathless death
Good god, let me give you  my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog
at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you  my sins
so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me  my deathless death
Good god, let me give you  my life
No masters or kings
when the ritual begins
There  is no sweeter innocence
than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of
that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean
Amen. Amen. Amen
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog
at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you  my sins
and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good god, let me give you  my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog
at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you  my sins
and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good god, let me give you  my life
