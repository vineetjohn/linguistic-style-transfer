Everlasting Light"

Let me be your everlasting light

The sun when there is none

I'm a shepherd for you

And I'll guide you through

Let me be your everlasting light

Let me be your everlasting light

(Shoo-shoo-shoo-wa)

I'll hold and never scold

(Shoo-shoo-shoo-wa)

In me you can confide

When no one's by your side

Let me be your everlasting light

(Shoo-shoo-shoo-wa)

Oh baby, can't you see

It's shinin' just for you

Loneliness is over

Dark days are through

They're through

(Shoo-shoo-shoo-shoo-shoo-shoo-shoo-wa)

Let me be your everlasting light

(Shoo-shoo-shoo-wa)

A train goin' 'way from pain

(Shoo-shoo-shoo-wa)

Love is the coal

That makes this train roll

Let me be your everlasting light

Yeah

Let me be your everlasting light

Let me be your everlasting light

Let me be your everlasting light
