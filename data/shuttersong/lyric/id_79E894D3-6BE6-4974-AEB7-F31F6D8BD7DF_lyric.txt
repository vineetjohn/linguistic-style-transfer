Tell me that you love me
When you know you don't love me
But I guess I guess I guess it's all good

You can play the game

Ain't no better way for it to be put
When you fuck them other girls
I bet they be wondering why you always call my name

You think I'm gonna wait around
I ain't got all day

Don't you let it go
I already got it covered
Let the others know

If you want it let's do it, ride it my pony
My saddle is waiting, come and jump on it

If somebody else like me don't come around
Boy you got it misunderstood

Put it in your face but you acting all scared
Like you can't recognize a good thing
