Oh, we can own the night
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing

I know we'll be alright
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing

[Verse 1:]
I'll take you to the future
Forget about the past
You can keep all of your secrets
I swear that I won't ask
Let go of all your troubles,
I don't care where you've been
The only thing that matters now
Is where the night will end

[Pre:]
Them bright big lights are shining on us
That beat so tight it makes you wanna
Get up get down like there's no tomorrow
Like there's no tomorrow
Like there's no tomorrow

[Chorus:]
Oh, we can own the night
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing

I know we'll be alright
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing

Oh, we can own the night
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing

[Verse 2:]
Let's get down to business
And show me what you got
Just keep the record spinning
The music never stops
You wanna live forever
And reach above the stars
Let's take it to next level
Just light the space ship up

[Pre:]
Them bright big lights are shining on us
That beat so tight it makes you wanna
Get up get down like there's no tomorrow
Like there's no tomorrow
Like there's no tomorrow

[Chorus:]
Oh, we can own the night
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing

I know we'll be alright
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing

Oh, we can own the night
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing

[Bridge:]
Yeah, on the rooftop
Surrounded by the stars and the views hot
Ain't nobody thinking 'bout what you got
Everything's ours, wanna dip? Get a new spot
Yeah, don't worry, don't worry
The night never ends, no hurry no hurry
Shorty look thick and the lines get blurry
And the nights in your palm so we might get dirty
DJ, let the beat play, make a heat wave, when you replay this
Tonight we gone party like its d-day
Young and free saying this the one on my CK shit
The Moon is the light
Sky is the ceiling
The low is the base and the high is the feeling
The world is the club, all in cause we can
This' one for the books don't worry bout a thang

[Chorus:]
Oh, we can own the night
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing

I know we'll be alright
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing

Oh, we can own the night
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing
