I can't believe that so much time was spent on my own
Just tryin' to figure it out all alone
Don't show emotion, let this go

I can pretend that everything is still okay
Until you rightfully say what you said
The night you left me here for dead, for dead.

Why do you cry when you're falling asleep?
And girl, how can you love without you ever losing it all?
Don't put your faith in this, we won't believe it!

Where did you go?
How will you find yourself, when your hand to hold is letting go?
Where did you go?
How will you tell yourself, you're losing hope, losing hope?

Is it just me or has the time we spent come undone
I know forever is not what you want
I'll pack my bags and brush it off, brush it off

Why do you cry when you're falling asleep?
And girl, how can you love without ever losing it all?
Don't put your faith in this, we won't believe it!

Where did you go?
How will you find yourself, when your hand to hold is letting go?
Where did you go?
How will you tell yourself, you're losing hope?

Tell me that you're alright
Yeah, like I really care
Why do we fight sometimes?
Just like we always do
Try to make up your mind
I'll make it up for you
Try to make up your mind
Your mind, your mind, your mind!
Where did you go?
How will you find yourself, when your hand to hold is letting go?
Where did you go?
How will you tell yourself, you're losing hope, losing hope?
