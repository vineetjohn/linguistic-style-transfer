When I'm fat and old

And my kids think I'm a joke
Cause I move a little slow when I dance
I can count on you after all that we've been through

Cause I know that you'll always understand
I won't act my age, no I won't act my age
No, I'll still feel the same around you

Hey!
When I'm fat and old and my kids think I'm a joke
Cause the stories that I told, I tell again and again
I can count on you after all we got up to

Cause I know that you truly understand
I won't act my age, no I won't act my age
No, I'll still feel the same around you
I won't act my age, no I won't act my age
No, I'll still feel the same and you will too

Hey!
When I can hardly walk and my hair is falling out
We'll still stay up till morning

We'll throw an after party, oh yeah, oh yeah
I won't act my age, no I won't act my age
No, I'll still feel the same around you
I won't act my age, no I won't act my age
No I'll still feel the same and you will too
