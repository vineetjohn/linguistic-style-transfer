Look, about my business, 'bout my grind
I'm livin' life because I'm runnin' out of time
It ain't nothing to a king, but it's hard work
Wanna be relaxin' in a condo when I'm older
Out here in LA, they hit me on my celli
Girl, we blend together like a peanut butter jelly
I'm goin' ham no deli
"Nate, oh my God you gettin' big"
Yeah you don't need to tell me
Watchin' people try made me try harder
Momma said, "Son, you startin' to look just like your father"
I guess I'm growin' up to the man that I wanna be
Tryna settle down but one of these girls that be callin' me
It's like

I been on the road for a minute
I been sellin' shows, gettin' hoes for a minute
Tell the tale, yeah it's goin' down
Lookin' for a girl that I can take around
So, wassup?
Wassup, babe?
Wassup? Wassup, babe?
Wassup? Wassup, babe?
Wassup? Wassup, babe?

Uh, I been in and all around all these places
I'm seein' faces that'll take you winnin' and the end is amazin'
It's like, how did this just happen?
I never even dreamt that my only day job is rappin'
But I'm gon' ride in that one
This is time to take in action
Cuz as of now my whole world, did, always needs a caption
So I'm gon' type it out
And now I just want you to realize
That you are the one and I can't lie
Got the coordination like hand-eye
You know I'm busy on standby, huh?
But nah, it's really time to go hard
So me and Skate are gonna keep on grindin' till we go far
So please, sit back, relax, and enjoy this
Cuz now it's time to live life to things as we know this

I been on the road for a minute
I been sellin' shows, gettin' hoes for a minute
Tell the tale, yeah it's goin' down
Lookin' for a girl that I can take around
So, wassup?
Wassup, babe?
Wassup? Wassup, babe?
Wassup? Wassup, babe?
Wassup? Wassup, babe?

All about the time and the work
Never finish second, always finish first
Better pay attention, better stay alert
This is how we do it

I been on the road for a minute
I been sellin' shows, gettin' hoes for a minute
Tell the tale, yeah it's goin' down
Lookin' for a girl that I can take around
So, wassup?
Wassup, babe?
Wassup? Wassup, babe?
Wassup? Wassup, babe?
Wassup? Wassup, babe?
