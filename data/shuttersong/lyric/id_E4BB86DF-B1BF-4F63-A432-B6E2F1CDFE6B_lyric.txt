I'm not a criminal
I'm not the villain
Yeah, this is personal
A drive-by killing
Your guns are loaded
And your lies are the bullets
So here is the trigger
Go ahead and pull it, now

Are you sure you wanna play this game?
Are you sure you wanna play it?

The only thing worse than a hater
The only thing worse than a hater
Is a traitor, a traitor, a traitor
You put the knife right in my back,
Killed any history we had
And now it's war, war

We were just like brothers
And we had each other
We were down for the good times
We were there for the trouble
Like a thief in the night
Broad daylight
You stole my sanity
Now you are the enemy

Are you sure you wanna play this game?
Are you sure you wanna play it?

The only thing worse than a hater
The only thing worse than a hater
Is a traitor, a traitor, a traitor
You put the knife right in my back,
Killed any history we had
Now it's war, war

(Oh, oh oh oh)
I should feel sorry for you
(Oh, oh oh oh)
Watching you drown in your denial
(Oh, oh oh oh)
But I can't feel sorry for you
(Oh, oh oh oh)
Watching you drown cause you're a traitor

The only thing worse than a hater
The only thing worse than a hater
Is a traitor, a traitor, a traitor
You put the knife right in my back,
Killed any history we had
Now it's war, war

The only thing worse than a hater
The only thing worse than a hater
Is a traitor, a traitor, a traitor
You put the knife right in my back,
Killed any history we had
Now it's war, war
