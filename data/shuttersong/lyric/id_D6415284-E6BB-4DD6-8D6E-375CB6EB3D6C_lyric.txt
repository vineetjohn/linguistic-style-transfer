Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na
I guess I just lost my husband
I don't know where he went

So I'm gonna drink my money
I'm not gonna pay his rent
(Nope!)
I got a brand new attitude

And I'm gonna wear it tonight
I'm gonna get in trouble
I wanna start a fight
Na-na-na-na, na-na, na

I wanna start a fight
Na-na-na-na, na-na, na
I wanna start a fight!
So, so what?

I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't need you
And guess what

I'm having more fun
And now that we're done
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright

I'm just fine
And you're a tool
So, so what?

I am a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight
Uh, check my flow, uh

The waiter just took my table
And gave it to Jessica Simp, shit!
I guess I'll go sit with drum boy
At least he'll know how to hit

What if this song's on the radio
Then somebody's gonna die
I'm gonna get in trouble
My ex will start a fight

Na-na-na-na, na-na, na
He's gonna start a fight
Na-na-na-na, na-na, na
We're all gonna get in a fight!

So, so what?
I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't need you

And guess what
I'm having more fun
And now that we're done
I'm gonna show you tonight

I'm alright
I'm just fine
And you're a tool

So, so what?
I am a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight

You weren't there
You never were

You want it all
But that's not fair
I gave you life
I gave my all

You weren't there
You let me fall
So, so what?
I'm still a rock star

I got my rock moves
And I don't need you
And guess what
I'm having more fun

And now that we're done
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright
I'm just fine
And you're a tool
So, so what?
I am a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight
No no, no no
I don't want you tonight
You weren't there
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright
I'm just fine
And you're a tool
So, so what?
I am a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight
Ba-da-da-da, da-da
