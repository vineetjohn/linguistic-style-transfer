Loving you was easy.
Thought you'd never leave me yeah, yeah
Wrapped around my finger
See ya when I see you yeah, yeah

Now I'm hearing around
That you been running around
I didn't think I'd miss you
Now I'm feeling like a fool
Ooh, ooh

It hit me like a heart attack
When you finally left me girl
I thought I'd never want you back
But I don't wanna live in a world without you
I don't wanna live in a world without you
I don't wanna live in a world without you

Never really noticed
All the little things you did, you did
Never bought you roses
Always was around my friends, my friends

And now I'm hearing around
That you been running around
I didn't think I'd miss you
Now I'm feeling like a fool
Ooh, ooh

It hit me like a heart attack
When you finally left me girl
I thought I'd never want you back
But I don't wanna live in a world without you
I don't wanna live in a world without you
I don't wanna live in a world without you

Never should've let you slip away
Living in a world that's turned to grey
Little did I know it hurts so bad

Cause it hit me like a heart attack
When you finally left me girl
I thought I'd never want you back
But I don't wanna live in a world without you
I don't wanna live in a world without you
I don't wanna live in a world without you, no oh
I don't wanna live in a world without you, no oh
I don't wanna live in a world without you
And now I'm hearing around
That you been running around
I didn't think I'd miss you
Now I'm feeling like a fool
Ooh ooh
