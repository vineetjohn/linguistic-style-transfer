I'm sitting here in a boring room
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
I'm wasting my time got nothing to do
I'm hanging around I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens
so I wonder
I'm driving around in my car
I'm driving too fast I'm driving too far
I'd like to change my point of view
I feel so lonely I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens
And I wonder
I wonder how I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the
Blue blue sky
And all that I can see
Is just a yellow lemon tree
I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning turning turning turning
Turning around
And all that I can see
Is just another lemon tree
Sing dah
Dah dah dah dam dee dab dah
Dah dah dah dam dee dab dah
Dab deedly dah
I'm sitting here I miss the power
I'd like to go out taking a shower
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
I feel so tired put myself into bed
Where nothing ever happens
And I wonder
Isolation is not good for me
Isolation I don't want to
Sit on a lemon tree
I'm steppin' around in a desert of joy
Baby anyhow I'll get another toy
And everything will happen
And you'll wonder
I wonder how I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the
Blue blue sky
And all that I can see
Is just another yellow lemon tree
I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning turning turning turning
Turning around
And all that I can see
Is just a yellow lemon tree
And I wonder wonder
I wonder how I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the
Blue blue sky
And all that I can see
And all that I can see
And all that I can see
Is just a yellow lemon tree
