A heart of gold but it lost it's pride
Beautiful veins and bloodshot eyes
I see your face in another light
Why'd you have to go and let it die

Why'd you have to go and let it die
Why'd you have to go and let it die
In too deep and out of time
Why'd you have to go and let it die

A simple man and his blushing bride
(Why'd you have to go and let it die)
Intravenous
Intertwined
(Why'd you have to go and let it die)
Hearts gone cold
Your hands were tied
(Why'd you have to go and let it die)

Why'd you have to go and let it die
(Why'd you have to go and let it die)
Why'd you have to go and let it die
Why'd you have to go and let it die

In too deep and out of time
Why'd you have to go and let it die
Do you ever think of me
You're so considerate

Did you ever think of me
Oh so considerate
In too deep and lost in time
Why'd you have to go and let it die
Beautiful veins and bloodshoot eyes
Why'd you have to go and let it die
Hearts gone cold and hands are tied

Why'd you have to go and let it die
Why'd you have to go and let it die
Do you ever think of me
You're so considerate

Did you think of me
Oh so considerate
In too deep and lost in time
Why'd you have to go and let it die
Beautiful veins and bloodshot eyes
Why'd you have to go and let it die
Hearts gone cold and hands are tied
Why'd you have to go and let it die
Why'd you have to go and let this die
Why'd you have to go and let this die
Why'd you have to go and let this die
Why'd you have to go and let this die
Why'd you have to go and let it die
