Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe

I can't breathe but I still fight
While I can fight, as long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High of a love, drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer
I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me
She fucking hates me
And I love it, wait where you going?

I'm leaving you

No, you ain't come back

We're running right back
Here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman
With the wind in his bag
She's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful
I feel so ashamed
I snap
Who's that dude?
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe when you're with them, you meet
And neither one of you
Even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling
Yeah, them chills used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewing venom and these words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair
Scratch, claw, bit 'em, throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments
When you're in 'em, it's the rage that took over
It controls you both

So they say it's best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday

Yesterday is over, it's a different day

Sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her

Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window, guess that's why they call it window

pane
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean

And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby, please come back
It wasn't you
Baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much
To walk away though
Come inside
Pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity
In my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault
Look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time
There will be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games
I just want her back
I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again, I'm 'na tie her to the bed and set the
house on fire
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie.
