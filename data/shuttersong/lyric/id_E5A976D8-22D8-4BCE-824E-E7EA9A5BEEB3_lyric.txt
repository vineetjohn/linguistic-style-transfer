I was walking away
But she's so beautiful it made me stay
I don't know her name

But I'm hoping she might feel the same
So here I go again
She got my heart again!
Tonight we'll dance
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
We won't look back
Take my hand and we will shine

Oh, oh, oh
She needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart
I got a wild heart
Stay here my dear

Feels like I've been standing right here for years
My mind's beat up
Tell me that you feel this, and I won't give up
I won't give up

Tonight we'll dance
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
We won't look back
Take my hand and we will shine
Oh, oh, oh
She needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart

I got a wild heart
Oh, oh, oh
She needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart
I got a wild heart
And I know it's late, I know it's cold

But come right here, I swear I'll never let you go
The way you move—it's wonderful
Let's do it now, 'cause one day we'll both be old
Oh whoa oh
Tonight we'll dance
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
We won't look back

Take my hand and we will shine
Oh, oh, oh

She needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart
I got a wild heart

Tonight we'll dance
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
We won't look back
Take my hand and we will shine
Oh, oh, oh
She needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart
I got a wild heart
Oh, oh, oh
She needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart
I've got a wild heart
