Six on the second hand
Two New Year's resolutions
And there's just no question
What this man should do

Take all the time lost
All the days that I cost
Take what I took and
Give it back to you

All this time
We were waiting for each other
All this time
I was waiting for you
We got all these words
Can't waste them on another

So I'm straight in a straight line
Running back to you
I don't know what day it is
I had to check the paper

I don't know the city
But it isn't home

But you say I'm lucky
To love something that loves me
But I'm torn as I could be

Wherever I roam, hear me say
All this time
We were waiting for each other
All this time
I was waiting for you
We got all these words
Can't waste them on another
So I'm straight in a straight line
Running back to you
Yeah, all running back to you
All running back to you, yeah
Oh, every time is so far
Every time it's so far
To get back to where you are
All this time
We were waiting for each other
All this time
I was waiting for you
We got all these love
Can't waste them on another
So I'm straight in a straight line
Running back to you
I'm straight in a straight line
Running back to you, yeah
Straight in a straight line
Running back to you
