Acapella - Karmin
 
Used to be your baby  used to be your lady
Thought you were the perfect lover
All the harmony went falling out of key  so
Now you gotta find another
Now you're talking crazy saying that you made me
Like I was your Cinderella
You and me are through  though  watch me hit it solo
I'ma do it acapella  yeah
I'ma do it acapella
 
Once upon a time  I met the perfect guy
He had that Colgate smile  he had that suit and tie
Mama always said get a rich boyfriend
You don't gotta love 'em  girl  you can pretend
You better totes believed her  yeah  every word she said
Thought he was gluten-free  but all that I got was bread
Mama always said nice guys finish last
Beat 'em at his own game  honey  take the cash
 
Ooh  and what a lucky girl you will be
But no  he didn't do jack for me
I want a bean with the beanstalk
And if the magic ain't right  time to walk

Out on our first date  he took me gourmet
We hit that Olive Garden  my Little Italy
Daddy always said let the gentleman pay
Never ever go Dutch at the buffet
I saw his bad intention  he didn't wanna talk
He put the saucy on it (oops ) time to check my wallet
Daddy always said money can't buy class
You don't wanna get stuck taking out trash
 
Ooh  yeah I guess it wasn't meant to be
Because he didn't do jack for me
I want a bean with the beanstalk
And if the magic ain't right  time to walk
