Step out into the sun
Skies above they radiate me
Lift up, carry the love
Do you know?

That I've been out of my mind
This slow life I'm waiting for you
To swing me all of your line
Do you know?

Since I've been walking solo
Dreaming you were back home
I find getting down low
Hide until tomorrow

Come back into the good life
Lose these hazy love lies
I've been chasing my mind
Lonely in the cold nights

Cause I'm kicking up stones without you
Can't pick up the phone without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you

And I'm digging down holes without you
Can't be on my own without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you

Step out into the dark
Where were you when I was trying
To lift up, carry the love
Do you know?

That I've been closing my eyes
Love me slow, hallucinating
Swinging me all of your light
Do you know?

Since I've been walking solo
Dreaming you were back home
I find getting down low
Hide until tomorrow

Come back into the good life
Lose these hazy love lies
I've been chasing my mind
Lonely in the cold nights

Cause I'm kicking up stones without you
Can't pick up the phone without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you

And I'm digging down holes without you
Can't be on my own without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you

Hold me close when it's over
Life goes slow loving sober
Feel my bones getting older
Sadness grows when you're cold

Cause I am one step heavy and two steps high
Hold it steady with you by my side
One step heavy and two steps high
Two steps high

Cause I'm kicking up stones without you
Can't pick up the phone without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you

And I'm digging down holes without you
Can't be on my own without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you

Without you
Without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you

And I'm digging down holes without you
Can't be on my own without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you
