If a plane crashed into my room
I wouldn't even flinch
I couldn't try to move
My mind is on you
My mind is on you

If the street lights smashed above me
I wouldn't move an inch
Turn the glass into stars
And your face is the moon

And the night turns to you
'Cause my mind is on you

You got me caught in a blaze
Panic for a minute
Got my brain in a daze
I wish you weren't in it
There are so many ways
To lose your attention
You can break everything but so what
I can take anything
I can take anything
I can take anything

If electric charges shock me
I'd smile and fold my arms
I'd feel nothing new
Because my mind is on you
Ooh, my mind is on you
Ooh...

And if the floor gave way to my shoes
I wouldn't try to fly
I can't explain why

You got me caught in a blaze
Panic for a minute
Got my brain in a daze
I wish you weren't in it
There are so many ways
To lose your attention
You can break everything but so what
I can take anything

You're the heat in my bones
Would you break my with stones?
You're the heat in my bones
Would you break my with your stones?

If a plane crashed into my room
I wouldn't even flinch
I couldn't try to move
My mind is always on you
My mind is always on you

Caught in a blaze
Panic for a minute
Got my brain in a daze
I wish you weren't in it
There are so many ways
To lose your attention
You can break everything but so what
Even when I'm caught in a blaze
Panic for a minute
Got my brain in a daze
I wish you weren't in it
There are so many ways
To lose your attention
You can break everything but so what
I can take anything
