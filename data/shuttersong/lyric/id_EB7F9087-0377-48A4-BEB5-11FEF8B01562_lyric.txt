I Get Crazy Feat  Lil Wayne - Nicki Minaj
I gets crazy
I gets crazy
I gets crazy
I gets crazy
I gets crazy
You know   it's like when I feel really crazy 
I just get my broom and fly away   
I go real real far away 
Young Money 
That's    that's that's just what we do 
Ya know  I mean we wear straight jackets 
And we  we  we  we st-stay ya know in padded rooms 
And ya know  and fly away 
I just came out of the mutherfuckin Old School
Got my Mac notebook with the Pro tools
Yahh Bitches ain't ready for NickI Lewinsky
Bad "WOOF WOOF" flyer then a Frisbee
So I'm up in Mid-LA eating Mangos
Keep a couple Pink Toes in my Sandals
Got some Bangles all over my Ankles
Such a Star they say I'm a Star Spangle
Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Banner
I am the Rap Hannah
Mah Mon Montana so fix your Antenna
I keep three hoes 
But don't call me Santa
And I am flyer then Reindeer
In the Winta (In the Winter)
I Get Crazy
I I Get Crazy
I Get Crazy
I I Get Crazy
I Get Crazy

So I got a Badd Bitch mentality
Cause I just came from another Galaxy
I be with the President up in the White House
If we in the Oval Office then the Lights Out
Cause I am the Wicked Witch I'm the Nickster
And I keep a Bad Bitch on my Jickster
But I leave her in a second for a Thicker
Rockstar little mama with a Guitar
I am NickI El Em En Oh Winsky
I mean my name Ring Bells like Tinky
I mean Tinker
Tell that Niqga Link her
Cause I'm looking for some Good Brains from a Thinker

Straight jacket crooked  I hear you Lookin
