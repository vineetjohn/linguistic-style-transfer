Morning, your toast, your tea and sugar
Read about the politician's lover
Go through the day like knife through butter
Why don't you
You dress in the colours of forgiveness
Your eyes as red as Christmas
Purple robes are folded on the kitchen chair

You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
In your dreams, everything is alright
Tomorrow dawns like someone else's suicide
You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight

Dreams
It's a dirty business, dreaming
Where there is silence and not screaming
Where there's no daylight, there's no healing
No no

You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
In your dreams, everything is alright
Tomorrow dawns like a suicide
But you're gonna sleep like a baby tonight

Hope is where the door is
When the church is where the war is
Where no one can feel no one else's pain

You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
In your dreams, everything is alright
Tomorrow dawns like a suicide
But you're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
Sleep like a baby tonight
Like a bird, your dreams take a flight
Like St. Francis covered in light
You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
