Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could have been the medicine
And now you're lying in the bed again
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them

My father told me, son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
You're not the only one
Although my grandma used to say
He used to sing

Darlin' hold me in your arms
The way you did last night
And we'll die inside
For a little while here oh

I could look into your eyes
Until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine
And slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine
Our hearts will beat as one
And we set alight
We're afire love

Love, love

Things were all good yesterday
Then the devil took your breath away
Now we're left here in the pain
Black suit black tie standing in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen
Six years old I remember when

My father told me, son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
You're not the only one
Although my grandma used to say
He used to sing

Darlin' hold me in your arms
The way you did last night
And we'll die inside
For a little while here oh

I could look into your eyes
Until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine
And slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine
Our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight
We're afire love

Love, love

See the love, the love, the love, the love
See the love, the love, the love, the love
See the love, the love, the love, the love

My father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my mother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to say hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
(To my brother and my sister, yeah, ah)
My father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing
Hallelujah

To the love, the love, the love, the love
To the love, the love, the love, the love
To the love, the love, the love, the love
