March winds and April showers
Make way for sweet May flowers
And then comes June, a moon and you
March winds and April showers
Romance will soon be ours
An outdoor paradise for two
March winds and April showers
Make way for sweet May flowers
And then comes June, a moon and you
March winds and April showers
Make way for the happy hours

And the May time, June time, love time and you
March winds and April showers
Make way for sweet May flowers
And then comes June, a moon and you
March winds and April showers

Romance will soon be ours
An outdoor paradise for two
