Oh oh, just as sure as the stars in the sky
I need you to show me the light
Not just for the meanwhile

for a long long time
Better believe it
Oh oh, whenever you're not in my presence
It feels like I'm missing my blessings, yeah

So I sleep through the daylight
stay awake all night
'Til you're back again, oh, yeah, yeah
You think I'm biased

To my significant other
You hit it right on the head

Only been missing my lover
Got a whole lotta texts on my phone and I don't reply
The next eight bars tell you why
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else

If it ain't you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
What's a king bed without a queen

There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me

Take the gas out the car it won't drive
That's how I feel when you're not by my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you, and only you
Oh oh, grateful for your existence
¡°
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
¡ª Justin Bieber
Faithful no matter the distance
You're the only girl I see
From the bottom of my heart, please believe
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else
If it ain't you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
What's a king bed without a queen
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're all that matters to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're all that matters to me
