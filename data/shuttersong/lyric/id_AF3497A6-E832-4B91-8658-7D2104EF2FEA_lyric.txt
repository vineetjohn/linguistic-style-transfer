Wooh, well, don't you know, baby?
Child, don't you know, baby?
Oww, don't you know, baby?
Little girl, little girl, don't you know?
Please listen to me, baby
Girl, I'm in love with you so

Turn your lamp down low
I said turn your lamp down low
Wooh, turn it down
Please turn your lamp down low
Come on baby
Girl, I'm in love with you so

Now I know I've been away
For such a long time
But now baby
I can't get you off of my mind

So come on, please baby come on
Come on, come on
Love your daddy all night long

Now if you love me
Like I love you
We can do all the things that we
Used to do

So come on, oww, baby come on
Please baby come on
Love your daddy all night long

Say, have you heard, baby?
Ray Charles is in town
Let's mess around till the midnight hour
See what he's puttin' down

Come on
Please baby, come on, child
Oh Lord, baby
Come on, all night long

Turn your lamp down low
'Cause I love you so
Baby, please come on
Love your daddy all night long
You hear me talkin', baby
Baby, please come on
