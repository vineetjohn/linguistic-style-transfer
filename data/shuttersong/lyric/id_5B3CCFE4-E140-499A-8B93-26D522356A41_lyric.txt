This too shall pass
oh but it always comes back
And it's knocking upon your door
You say how did you find me here
Cause I've been running for years
Now you're back in the same place
You've been here before
Stuck in a maze trying to find an open door
Pray for the strength and take a leap of faith
You fail in your mind long before you ever try
Why do you believe those lies
You love to drown your fears
But you've been drowning for years
in tears
Back in the same place
You've been here before
Stuck in a maze trying to find an open door
Pray for the strength and take a leap of faith
So what are you waiting for
Cause there is a Saviour waiting to save you
What are you drowning for
Back in the same place
You've been here before
Stuck in a maze trying to find an open door
Pray for the strength and take a leap of faith
