All alone
Guess again
You've been known
To take the hand of any man
Who will fill your fantasy
See you there
A big mistake
You're the pride
Of everything that comes around
This messed up town

You know, and I know, and I know
It's always better when
You know and I know, and I know
It's always better when
You find out we've been lying, cheating

Baby
Give me a sign
Give me a reason
Make up your mind
Darling, only a fool
Couldn't see through us
Know what we do

Just because
You're a fan
Doesn't mean
You've joined the band
And found a way
To make them think that
You're a star
Silly girl
Only I can fool the world
It's plain to see
'Cause you're just like me

You know, and I know, and I know
It's always better when
You know and I know, and I know
It's always better when
You find out we've been lying, cheating

Baby
Give me a sign
Give me a reason
Make up your mind
Darling, only a fool
Couldn't see through us
Know what we do

You know, and I know, and I know
It's always better when
You know and I know, and I know
It's always better when
You know, and I know, and I know
It's always better when
You find out we've been lying, cheating

Baby
Give me a sign
Give me a reason
Make up your mind
Darling, only a fool
Couldn't see through us
To know what we do
You know that it's true
The things that you do
I'm out of my mind
In love with you
