"Hello, I Love You"

Hello, I love you 
Won't you tell me your name? 
Hello, I love you 
Let me jump in your game 
Hello, I love you 
Won't you tell me your name? 
Hello, I love you 
Let me jump in your game 

She's walking down the street 
Blind to every eye she meets 
Do you think you'll be the guy 
To make the queen of the angels sigh? 

Hello, I love you 
Won't you tell me your name? 
Hello, I love you 
Let me jump in your game 
Hello, I love you 
Won't you tell me your name? 
Hello, I love you 
Let me jump in your game 

She holds her head so high 
Like a statue in the sky 
Her arms are wicked, and her legs are long 
When she moves my brain screams out this song 

Sidewalk crouches at her feet 
Like a dog that begs for something sweet 
Do you hope to make her see, you fool? 
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel? 

Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello 
I want you 
Hello 
I need my baby 
Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello
