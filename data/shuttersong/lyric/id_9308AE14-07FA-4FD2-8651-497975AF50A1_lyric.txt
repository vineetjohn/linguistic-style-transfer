I'll feel the fear for you,
I'll cry your tears for you
I'll do anything I can to make you comfortable
Even if I fall down
when you're not around
Don't worry about me,
don't worry about me

Cause if I fall,
you'll fall
And if I rise,
we'll rise together
When I smile,
you'll smile
And don't worry about me,
don't worry about me

I'll feel the fear for you,
I'll cry your tears for you
I'll do anything I can to make you comfortable
Even if I fall down
when you're not around
Don't worry about me,
don't worry about me

I'll climb the hills you face,
I'll do this in your place
I'd do anything to go through it instead of you
But even if I fall down
when you're not around
Don't worry about me,
don't worry about me

Cause if I fall,
you'll fall
And if I rise,
we rise together
When I smile,
you'll smile
And don't worry about me,
don't worry about me

Cause if I fall,
you'll fall
And if I rise,
we rise together
When I smile,
you'll smile
And don't worry about me,
don't worry about me

Cause if I fall,
you'll fall
And if I rise,
we'll rise together
When I smile,
you'll smile
And don't worry about me,
don't worry about me
Don't worry about me,
don't worry about me.
