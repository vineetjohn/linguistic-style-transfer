Some people think they're always right.
Others are quiet and uptight.
Others they seem so very nice (nice nice nice oh-ho).
Inside they might feel sad and wrong (oh no).
Twenty-nine different attributes.
Only seven that you like
Twenty ways to see the world
Twenty ways to start a fight

(Oh don't don't) Don't get up.
I can't see the sunshine.
I'll be waiting for you baby
'Cause I'm through.

Sit me down.
Shut me up.
I'll calm down
and I'll get along with you.

Oh men don't notice what they got.
Women think of that a lot.
One thousand ways to please your man (oh-ho).
Not even one requires a plan (I know).
And Countless odd religions too.
It doesn't matter which you choose (oh no).
One stubborn way to turn your back (oh-ho).
This I've tried, and now refuse (oh-ho).

(Don't don't) Don't get up.
I can't see the sunshine.
Oh, I'll be waiting for you baby
'Cause I'm through.

Sit me down.
Shut me up.
I'll calm down
and I'll get along with you.
(Alright)
Shut me up
Shut me up
And I'll get along with you.
