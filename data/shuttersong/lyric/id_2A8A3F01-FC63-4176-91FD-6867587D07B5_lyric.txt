It may not mean nothing to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm sellin' shit down at the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
Last name, Ever, first name, Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy ain't nothin' to play with
It started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis
And your city faded off to brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo

If I was at the club, you know I ball, Kimo
Drop the mix tape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcom

Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everybody who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness

If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches
It may not mean nothing to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
2I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm sellin' shit down at the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
(Kanye West)
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard, all fall like the ball teams

Just so I could make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory

When a nigga blow up, they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, what, nuttin'
Now super bad chicks givin' me Mac lovin'
You'd think I ran the world like Michelle's husband

You'd think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no, you fuckin' wasn't
You're such a fuckin' loser, he didn't even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back

Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasin' that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap

I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back
It may not mean nothing to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
(Drake)
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm sellin' shit down at the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
(Lil Wayne)
Okay, hello it's da martian, space jam Jordan's
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target

If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, to the top
Life is like a fuckin' roller coaster then it drops

But what should I scream for, this is my theme park
My mind shines even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention

Lil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foots sleepin' on the gas

No brake pads, no such thing as last
It may not mean nothing to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all

I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm sellin' shit down at the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call

I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
☆Eminem☆
There they go
Back in stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go

Macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
We can make them look like Bozo's
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow
Fuck, no, go for broke

His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a real buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They've been waitin' patiently

For Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes

And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that
I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of the booth, truth spillin'
And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way
That you got at me, so how's it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, son
Just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place
So Drake
It may not mean nothing to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm sellin' shit down at the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
