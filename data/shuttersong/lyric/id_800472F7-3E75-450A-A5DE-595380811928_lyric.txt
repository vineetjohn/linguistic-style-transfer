I don't want the way
all the flame will never die

No it won't go out cause we're standing by
If the fire start burning we'll send it back alight
And it will shine forever as long as we're alive

As it is
As it times
It exists
Living it
Here it is
As it is
As it times
It exists
Living it
Here it is
As it is

Girl you set love alight
You set my world on fire

You set love alight
You set my soul on fire

You set love alight
You set my world on fire

Yeah
I'm seeing all the truth
I see it going in your eyes
If (...) be alone
Yeah
We can make it right
Have a heart on fire
secret joy all through the night
I feel love everytime cause music makes me feel alive

As it is
As it times
It exists
Living it
Here it is
As it is
As it times
It exists
Living it
Here it is
As it is

Girl you set love alight
You set my world on fire

You set love alight
You set my soul on fire

You set love alight
You set my world on fire

Girl you set love alight
You set my world on fire

You set love alight
You set my soul on fire

You set love alight
You set my world on fire
