You
You

You
You
You are still a whisper on my lips

A feeling at my fingertips
That's pulling at my skin
You leave me when I'm at my worst

A feeling as if I've been cursed
Bitter cold within
Days go by and still I think of you
Days when I couldn't live my life without you
Days go by and still I think of you
Days when I couldn't live my life without you

Without you
Without you
You are still a whisper on my lips

A feeling at my fingertips
That's pulling at my skin
You leave me when I'm at my worst

A feeling as if I've been cursed
Bitter cold within
Days go by and still I think of you
Days when I couldn't live my life without you

Without you
Without you
Days go by and still I think of you
Days when I couldn't live my life without you
Days go by and still I think of you
Days when I couldn't live my life without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
