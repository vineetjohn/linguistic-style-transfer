Take take it all away,
Save my heart for another day
I'm up late on the telephone
And I'm all alone with the dial tone
Wait wait 'till the sun is up,
Drown my dreams in a coffee cup,
Palms out, wanna beg for luck
But I'm way too proud, never giving up

Oh, something's gotta happen,
Something's gotta give and something's got to break
I know, someday it's gonna happen,
Someday it's gonna give, can't always be this way

And if the riptide comes to get me,
And pulls me under, it won't upset me, I'll go down
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
I'll throw the white flag of surrender,
Knock me down, not forever, just for now
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)

Give give everything I've got,
Out of reach but I'll take a shot,
Kick rocks in the parking lot,
Feel like giving up, but I'll never stop
Run run, running like a fool,
Never win if you never lose,
Find hope and a little truth,
Gonna learn new tricks, gotta jump through hoops

Oh, something's gotta happen,
Something's gotta give and something's got to break
I know, someday it's gonna happen,
Someday it's gonna give, can't always be this way

And if the riptide comes to get me,
And pulls me under, it won't upset me, I'll go down
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
I'll throw the white flag of surrender,
Knock me down, not forever, just for now
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)

Not forever, just for now
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, not forever, not forever
Won't stay down

Not forever, just for now
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, not forever, not forever
Won't stay down

And if the riptide comes to get me,
And pulls me under, it won't upset me, I'll go down
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
I'll throw the white flag of surrender,
Knock me down, not forever, just for now
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)

And if the riptide comes to get me,
And pulls me under, it won't upset me, I'll go down
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
I'll throw the white flag of surrender,
Knock me down, not forever, just for now
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
