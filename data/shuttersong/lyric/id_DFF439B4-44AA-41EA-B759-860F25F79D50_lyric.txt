I didn't mean to end his life
I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night
Can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight
Before I end up behind bars

What started out as a simple altercation
Turns into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Could've been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun

Rum pa pa pam
Rum pa pa pam
Rum pa pa pam
Man down
Rum pa pa pam
Rum pa pa pam
Rum pa pa pam
Man down

oh mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big old crowd
Oh why, oh why
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station

It's a 22, I call her Peggy Sue
When she fits right down in my shoes
What you expect me to do
If you're playing me for a fool
I will lose my cool
And reach for my fire arm

I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town

Rum pa pa pam
Rum pa pa pam
Rum pa pa pam
Man down

Rum pa pa pam
Rum pa pa pam
Rum pa pa pam
Man down
oh mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big old crowd

Oh why, oh why
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
Said, I never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it, oh gosh
What ever happened to me

Ever happened to me, ever happened to me
Why did I pull de trigger
Pull de trigger, pull de trigger, boom
And end a nigga, end a niggas life so soon
When me pull de trigger, pull de trigger, pull it 'pon you
Somebody tell me what I'm gonna, what I'm gonna do
Rum pa pa pam
Rum pa pa pam
Rum pa pa pam
Me say wah man down (A weh me say)

Rum pa pa pam
Rum pa pa pam
Rum pa pa pam
When me went downtown
'Cause now I am a criminal, criminal, criminal
Oh lord have mercy now I am a criminal
Man down
Tell the judge please give me minimal
Run out of town,
None of dem can see me now, see me now
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big old crowd
Oh why, oh why
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
