I wanna go back,
Forget that it's over
Paint it in black,
When you left me alone
I never knew,
She was sleeping next door with the kid I grew up with,
And I can't go back to her anymore, no

You tell me you were happier with him, but you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
No, I can't lift the weight

Put you in the past,
Try to forget you 'cause it's over
And every time you ask
I'll pretend I'm okay
You're inside my head
In the middle of the night
When I don't feel right
I dream I can hold you,
And I can't go back to you anymore, yeah, yeah

You tell me you were happier with him, but you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
But I can't lift the weight, and I can't lift the weight

And I can't lift the weight, no, I can't lift the weight
Yeah, you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
And I can't lift the weight, no, I can't lift the weight
Yeah, you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
And I can't lift the weight, no, I can't lift the weight
Yeah, you lower your standards and I raise the stakes
And I can't lift the weight, no, I can't lift the weight

You tell me you were happier with him, but you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you, you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
But I can't lift the weight, and I can't lift the weight

You tell me you were happier with him, but you want me to stay
You told me that you needed time but you, you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, say someday you will change,
But I don't wanna wait
