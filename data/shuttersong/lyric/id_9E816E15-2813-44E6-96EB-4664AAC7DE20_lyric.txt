I solve my problems and I see the light
We gotta plug and think, we gotta feed it right
There ain't no danger, we can go too far
We start believing now that we can be who we are

Grease is the word

They think our love is just a growing pain
Why don't they understand it's just a crying shame?
Their lips are lying, only real is real
We start to find right now, we got to be what we feel

Grease is the word
Grease is the word, is the word that you heard
It's got groove, it's got meaning
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Grease is the way we are feeling

We take the pressure and we throw away
Conventionality belongs to yesterday
There is a chance that we can make it so far
We start believing now that we can be who we are

Grease is the word
Grease is the word, is the word that you heard
It's got groove, it's got meaning
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Now, Grease is the way we are feeling

This is the life of illusion
Wrapped up in trouble, laced with confusion
What are we doing here?

We take pressure and we throw away
Conventionality belongs to yesterday
There is a chance, we can make it so far
We start believing now that we can be who we are

Grease is the word
Grease is the word, is the word that you heard
It's got groove, it's got meaning
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Now, Grease is the way we are feeling

Grease is the word, is the word that you heard
It's got groove, it's got meaning
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Now, Grease is the way we are feeling
Grease is the word
Is the word
Is the word
Is the word
