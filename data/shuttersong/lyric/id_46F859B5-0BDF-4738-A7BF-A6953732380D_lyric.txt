And I just
Like the way it's going
Like the way it's sounding
Like it when you tellin me you feel the same
Never tried to hide it
Didn't try to fight it
Now it hit me and I just can't explain
Like the way its going
Like the way it's sounding
Like it when you tellin me you feel the same
Never tried to hied it
Didn't try to fight it
Now it hit me and I just can't explain it

After sunrise passion
She continued to grasp her phone
Her other hand over her chest
Behind a smile
She wanna borrow a couple coins for the bus ride home
It's five minutes til her psych test

She promised to leave
And I guess I believed her
Don't need to change the key like Lex Luger
Never rubbed the belly of a Buddha
I have luck stuck in my blood
Girl, now it's runnin' through ya

She left, I stayed afloat in my bed
I was tempted to go pick her up from class
But I rolled up instead
Candle burnt to the bottom of the wick

It's the one I had

Lt in my room just before she came through
She can laugh with my main crew
That's how you know she gon stay so cool
Her body's smooth like a summer sand dune
It feels so good when everything's brand new
And she got me sayin
Like the way it's going
Like the way it's sounding
Like it when you tellin me you feel the same
Never tried to hide it
Didn't try to fight it
Now it hit me and I just can't explain

Seein' her face underneath the sun
Had enough hangin' out
Let's go have some fun
Always betting high
That's how we do it on my side of town

Peeled the same bill twice
She made me miscount
Don't slow down, you make me feel right
The 55's ready for tonight, can't stop my stares
Girl, this dress' way too tight
Time for me to show you why you chose to be with me
Alright?

Grip on my skin, kiss on my lips, grab on your hips and work it
No need for courage, cause you found your niche
Where everything is perfect
And I like that style, make her open up her smile
I'll devote my time with her
And I knew when I met her, everything would get better
So I'm heading on the road with her that's right
Like the way it's going
Like the way it's sounding
Like it when you tellin me you feel the same

Never tried to hide it
Didn't try to fight it
Now it hit me and I just can't explain She holds it down

Be my queen, wear this crown
Not a thing, gonna get up in my way
Smile at everything I say
Cause she holds it down
Be my queen, wear this crown

Not a thing, gonna get up in my way
Smile at everything I say
Cause she holds it down
Be my queen, wear this crown
Not a thing, gonna get up in my way
Smile at everything I say
(I'll make her smile all I want)
Cause she holds it down
Be my queen, wear this crown
Not a thing, gonna get up in my way
Smile at everything I say
(I'll make her smile all I want)
