Yes, I do, I believe that one day
I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon and the stars are nothing without you

Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming
It's much too strong

Can I lay by your side?
Next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here
If I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

Can I lay by your side?
Next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here
If I can't be with you tonight
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Can I lay by your side?
Next to you, you...
