I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til it's bright out
Whoa, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

[Rick Ross:]
Bitch I¡¯m a monster no good blood sucker
fat motherfucker now look who¡¯s in trouble
as you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West sample, here¡¯s one for example

[Kanye West - Chorus:]
Gossip gossip
nigga just stop it
everybody know (I¡¯m a motherfucking monster)
I¡¯ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I¡¯ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
profit profit, nigga I get it
everybody know I¡¯m a motherfucking monster
I¡¯ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I¡¯ma need to see your fucking hands...

The best living or dead hands down huh?
less talk more head right now huh?
and my eyes more red than the devil is
and I¡¯m bout to take it to another level bitch
none of who you go and get, ain't nobody's cold as this
do the rap and attract triple double no assist
but my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
argue with my older bitch acting like I owe her shit
I heard the people saying raps are getting trap mayne
bought the chain that always give me back pain
fucking up my money so yeah I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
she came up to me and said this the number 2 gal
if you wanna make it number one you're number 2 now
this that goose an¡¯ Malibu I call it Malibooya
God damn Yeezy how we hit em with the new style
know that motherfucker well, what you gonna do now
whatever I wanna do, gosh it's cool now
nah gonna do, uh it's a new now
think you motherfucker really really need to cool down
cause you will never get on top of this
so mommy best advice is just to get on top of this
have you ever had sex with a pharaoh
I put the pussy in a sarcophagus
now she claiming that I bruise her esophagus
head of the class and she just want a swallowship
I¡¯m living in the future so the present is my past
my presence is a present kiss my ass

[Kanye West - Chorus]

[Jay-Z:]
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong
Lochness, Goblin, Ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
question what do these things all have in common
everybody knows I¡¯m a motherfucking monster
conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
none of you niggas have seen the carnage that I¡¯ve seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
murder murder in black convertibles
I kill a block I murder the avenues
rape and pillage a village, women and children
everybody wanna know what my Achilles' heel is
Love I don't get enough of it
all I get is these vampires and blood suckers
all I see is these niggas I¡¯ve made millionaires
milling about, spilling their feelings in the air
all I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
tryna draw blood from my ice cold veins
I smell a massacre
seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj:]
Pull up in the monster
automobile gangster
with a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
yeah I¡¯m in that Tonka, colour of Willy Wonka
you could be the King but watch the Queen conquer
OK first things first I¡¯ll eat your brains
then I¡¯mma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
cause that¡¯s what a motherfucking monster do
hairdresser from Milan, that's the monster do
monster Giuseppe heel that¡¯s the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and the monster crew
and I¡¯m all up all up all up in the bank with the funny face
and if I¡¯m fake I ain't notice cause my money ain't
let me get this straight wait I¡¯m the rookie
but my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50k for a verse, no album out!
yeah my money¡¯s so tall that my Barbie's gotta climb it
hotter than a middle eastern climate
find it Tony Matterhorn dutty wine it
while it, Nicki on them titties when I sign it
have these niggas so one-track minded
but really really I don¡¯t give a F-U-C-K
forget barbie fuck Nicki she¡¯s fake
she¡¯s on a diet but her pockets eating cheese cake
and I¡¯ll say Bride of Chucky is child¡¯s play
just killed another career it¡¯s a mild day
besides ¡®Ye they can¡¯t stand besides me
I think me, you and Am* should menage Friday
pink wig, thick ass, give em whiplash
I think big get cash make em blink fast
now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, I¡¯m a motherfucking monster!

[Bon Iver:]
I-I crossed the line-line
and I¡¯ll-I¡¯ll let God decide-cide
I-I wouldn¡¯t last these shows
so I-I am headed home
