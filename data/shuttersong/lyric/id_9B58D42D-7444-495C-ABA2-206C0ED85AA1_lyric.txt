Been a minute since we've slept together
Finna get myself together
I've been thinkin' about everything
I don't know if it's because I'm lonely
Lonely on a Wednesday night
Girl I'm lonely
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet
Girl I'm lonely
That shit ain't my fault girl
Cause I'm lonely
Name another woman, ain't no other woman who should come for me
When I'm lonely
Mix the Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I'm lonely, when I'm lonely

Heard you spent your summers in Miami
At somebody's house that you didn't buy
You're young, yeah, have fun, girl, but i hope it was worth it
Cause fuck it I'm not here to judge
Fuck it I'm not here to love everything you did to ball
Fuck it, I'm just glad you called
Ring ring ring, what a thing
Ring ring ring, school bell, I ring
You and I got options, bae
But name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should comfort me when I'm lonely when I'm lonely
Mix the Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I'm lonely, when I'm lonely
This shit ain't my fault!
