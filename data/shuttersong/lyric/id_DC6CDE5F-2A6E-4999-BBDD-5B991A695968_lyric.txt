If you were falling
Then I would catch you

You need a light
I'd find a match

Cause I love the way you say good morning
And you take me the way I am

If you are chilly
Here take my sweater

Your head is aching
I'll make it better

Cause I love the way you call me baby
And you take me the way I am

I'd buy you Rogaine
When you start losing all your hair

Sew on patches
To all you tear

Cause I love you more than I could ever promise
And you take me the way I am mmm

you take me the way I am
you take me the way I am
