My love, My love, My love
What would I do without ma love
My love, My love, My love

Lately I've been sensing
theres some problems going on with us, (Yea, U and I)
And baby thats a problem I take real serious
I can't lie
It gets to me
I don't know what to do but to tell u that I love you
And you know this cause I show it
Outsiders try to blow it but I can't let it happen No

Everybody's business ain't nobody's business
In other words
They don't know half of what I go through
(To give) give you what u need
(To be there) to be there for you and still do my thing
I'm talkin' bout music
Cause it's what I gotta do to express how I really feel
See you write the song girl and I just do the singing
Without you I can't live
So heart to heart

Baby heart to heart
(Baby you're) You're the biggest part of my needs, girl
They can tell their stories
What you do for me
It gets too deep, girl

What I'd do for you
You'll never know
What they say to you
Girl let him go (You don't need him)
You don't need him
You'd be better off hanging out with me
They try to break us up
They don't understand our love cause it gets to deep, girl

I know a way to make a bunch of people love me
If you were to leave me all by myself
Soon as we turn our way back they hustle out
To tell someone else whats going on
Misery likes company but we're the only company
we need to be happy
And you know this cause I show it
Outsiders try to blow it but I can't let it happen No
