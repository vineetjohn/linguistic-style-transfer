Cut my life into pieces
This is my last resort
Suffocation
No breathing

Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm, bleeding
This is my last resort
Cut my life into pieces
I've reached my last resort
Suffocation
No breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm, bleeding
Do you even care if I die bleeding?

Would it be wrong?

Would it be right?
If I took my life tonight

Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight

And I'm contemplating suicide
'Cause I'm losing my sight
Losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight

Losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
I never realized I was spread too thin

'Till it was too late

And I was empty within
Hungry!
Feeding on chaos and living in sin

Downward spiral

Where do I begin?
It all started when I lost my Mother
No love for myself

And no love from another

Searching!
To find a lover on a higher level
Finding nothing but questions and devils
'Cause I'm losing my sight
Losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

Losing my sight
Losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Nothing is alright
Nothing is fine
I'm running, and I'm cryin'
I'm cryin', I'm cryin', I'm cryin, I'm cryin'
I
can't
go
on
living
this
way
Cut my life into pieces
This is my last resort!
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm, bleeding
Would it be wrong? Would it be right?
If I took my life tonight
Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplating suicide
'Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Nothing's alright, nothing is fine
I'm running and I'm crying
I can't go on living this way!
Can't go on
Living this way!
Nothing's all right!
