I was seven years old, when I got my first pair
And I stepped outside
And I was like, "Momma, this air bubble right here, it's gonna make me fly"
I hit back-court and when I jumped, I jumped, I swear I got so high
I touched the net, "Mom, I touched the net," this is the best day of my life

Air Max's were next,
That air bubble, that mesh

The box, the smell, the stuffin', the tread,

At school
I was so cool

I knew that I couldn't crease 'em

My friends couldn't afford 'em

Four stripes on their Adidas

On the court I wasn't the best, but my kicks were like the pros
Yo, I stick out my tongue so everyone could see that logo
Nike Air Flight, but that was so dope

And then my friend Carlos' brother got murdered for his Fours, whoa
See he just wanted a jump shot, but they wanted his Starter coat, though

Didn't wanna get caught, from Genesee Park to Othello
You could clown for those Pro Wings, with the Velcro

Those were not tight
I was trying to fly without leaving the ground,

Cause I wanted to be like Mike, right

Wanted to be him,

I wanted to be that guy, I wanted to touch the rim

I wanted to be cool, and I wanted to fit in,
I wanted what he had, America, it begins


I want to fly

Can you take me far away?
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes

And I'll go so high
I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
I stitch my wings
And pull the strings

I bought these dreams
That all fall down
We want what we can't have, commodity makes us want it

So expensive, damn, I just got to flaunt it
Got to show 'em, so exclusive, this that new shit
A hundred dollars for a pair of shoes I would never hoop in
Look at me, look at me, I'm a cool kid
I'm an individual, yeah, but I'm part of a movement
My movement told me be a consumer and I consumed it
They told me to just do it, I listened to what that swoosh said
Look at what that swoosh did
See it consumed my thoughts
Are you stupid, don't crease 'em, just leave 'em in that box
Strangled by these laces, laces I can barely talk
That's my air bubble and I'm lost if it pops
We are what we wear, we wear what we are
But see I look inside the mirror and think Phil Knight tricked us all

Will I stand for change or stay in my box
These Nikes help me define me, but I'm trying to take mine off
I want to fly
Can you take me far away?
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high
I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
I stitch my wings
And pull the strings
I bought these dreams
That all fall down
It started out with what I wear to school
That first day, like these are what make you cool
And this pair, this would be my parachute
So much more than just a pair of shoes
Nah, this is what I am
What I wore, this is the source of my youth
This dream that they sold to you
For a hundred dollars and some change
Consumption is in the veins
And now I see it's just another pair of shoes
