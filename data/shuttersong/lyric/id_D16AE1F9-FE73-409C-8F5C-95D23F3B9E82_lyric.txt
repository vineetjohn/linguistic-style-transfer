Left my fear by the side of the road
I hear You speak, won't let go
Fall to my knees as I lift my hands to pray

Got every reason to be here again
Father's love that draws me in

And all my eyes wanna see is a glimpse of You

All I need is You
All I need is You, Lord

Is You, Lord

All I need is You

All I need is You, Lord

Is You, Lord
One more day and it's not the same

Your Spirit calls my heart to sing
Drawn to the voice of my Savior once again
Where would my soul be without Your Son?
Gave His life to save the earth
Rest in the thought that You're watching over me
'Cause all I need is You
All I need is You, Lord
Is You, Lord
'Cause all I need is You
All I need is You, Lord
Is You, Lord
All I need is You, You, You
'Cause all I need is You
'Cause all I need is You
All I need is You
'Cause all I need is You
And all I need is You
All I need is You, Lord
Is You, Lord
All I need is You
All I need is You, Lord
Is You, Lord
All I need is You
All I need is You
You, Jesus
You save my soul, You make me whole
I'm new because of You
You hold the universe
You hold everyone on earth
You hold the universe
You hold, yeah, You hold
You hold the universe
And You hold everyone on earth
You hold the universe
You hold, You hold
You hold the universe
You hold everyone on earth
You hold the universe
You hold, You hold
All I need is You
All I need is You, Lord
Is You, Lord
All I need is You, Jesus
All I need is You, Lord
Is You, Lord
All I need is You
All I need is You, Lord
Is You, Lord
All I need is You
All I need is You, Lord
Is You, Lord
