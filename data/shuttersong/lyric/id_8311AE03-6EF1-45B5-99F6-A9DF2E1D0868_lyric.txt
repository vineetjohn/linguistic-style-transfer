She Way Out - The 1975	
.	

With a face from a movie scene	
Or magazine, you know what I mean	
She's definitely got the style on you	
She's definitely got the style on you	
.	
She's got two-tone everything	
Moving but she just can't move	
She's got two phones, everything, you	
Moving but she just can't move	
.	
Because "she way out"	
I've never seen her dance moves	
dancing like "she way out"	
	
"She way out"	
I've never seen her talk	
but I'm telling you "she way out"	
.	
She said "It's not about your body	
it's just social implications are	
Brought upon by this party	
that we're sitting in"	
And "I'd like to say you've changed	
but you're always the same.	
I've got a feeling	
that the marijuana's rotting your brain"	
.	
She's got two-tone everything - way too intelligent	
Moving but she just can't move	
She's got two phones, everything.	
Boyfriend,	
Telling him "Find me cause I'll never find you"	
.	
Because "she way out"	
I've never seen her dance moves	
dancing like "she way out"	
"She way out"	
I've never seen her talk	
but I'm telling you "she way out"	
Because "she way out"	
I've never seen her dance moves	
dancing like "she way out"	
"She way out"	
I've never seen her talk	
but I'm telling you "she way out"	
.	
The tension is overflowing with every Benson	
She's throwing on the floor and in my mouth	
She said "I'd love you to stay but that's simply insane -	
I've got a feeling that my friends are gonna kick in your brain"	
Because...	
.	
"She way out"	
I've never seen her dance moves	
dancing like "she way out"	
"She way out"	
I've never seen her talk	
but I'm telling you "she way out"	
"She way out"	
I've never seen her dance moves	
dancing like "she way out"	
"She way out"	
I've never seen her talk	
but I'm telling you "she way out"
