I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
And then it was clear
I can't deny, I really miss him

To think that I was wrong
I guess you don't know what you got till it's gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us

He wasn't my everything till we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
But now that he's gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away

Cause you are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything

I know you're not far but I still can't handle all the distance
You're travelling with my heart
I hope this is a temporary feeling
Cause it's too much to bare
Without you and I know sorry ain't the cure
If I cross your mind just know I'm yours
Cause what we got is worth fighting for
Cause you are

You weren't my everything till we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away

Cause you are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything
