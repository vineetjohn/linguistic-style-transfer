
Tell me whatcha say now?
Tell me whatcha say
Come again?
If you cannot stay down
Then you do not have to pretend

Like there is no way out
I shoulda never let you in
Cause you got me face down
And don't take this personal

But you're the worst

You know what you've done to me
And although it hurts I know
I just can't keep runnin' away
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
But I want you

I don't mean to
I don't mean to

I don't mean to
I don't mean to
But I love you
Tell me whatcha say now
Tell me whatcha say?
You said that you would come again

You said that we would remain friends but
You know that I do not depend on
Nothing or no one

So why would you show up
So uninvited then
Just change my mind like that

Please don't take this personal
But you ain't shit
And you weren't special
Til I made you so

You better act like you know
That I've been through worse than you
I just can't keep running away
I don't need you
I don't need you

I don't need you
I don't need you
But I want you
I don't mean to
I don't mean to

I don't mean to
I don't mean to
But I love you
Everybody's like, he's no item
Please don't like him
He don't wife em
He one nights em
I never listen, no
I should have figured though
All that shit you was spitting, so unoriginal
But it was you, so I was with it
And tell you the truth, wish we never did it
Cause I usually do stick to the business
But you came out the blue and then you just flipped it
God damn baby, my mind's blown
I be forgetting you live in a different time zone
I think I know what this is
It's just the time's wrong

And yea I know what you did
But baby I'm grown
And my love is patient
And kind, and shit

If this is real we can build
Through different types of shit

If you was really the realest
Wouldn't be fightin' it
I think your pride is just
In the way

Funny how everything changed
Once you got all that you wanted
Nothing was ever the same
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I still want you
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
But I, but I love you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
But I want you
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
But I love you
