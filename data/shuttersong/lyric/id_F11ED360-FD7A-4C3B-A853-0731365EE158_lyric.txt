I'm like that boom box outside of your window
I'm that Delorean blowing past 88
And where we're going girl,
Won't be needing roads cause,
Oo oo oo oo
This ain't no 50 first dates.

I'm talking bout starting out as friends
I'm talking bout real and not pretend
I'm talking bout roles of a life time
You and I can even right the end
Yeaaaaah

Here comes that movie scene
The one you think is so cliche
That moment when we kissed
By the lake pouring rain
I ain't no superman
But I can change your world
Ooooooo
Here comes forever girl
Ooooooo
Here comes forever
Ooooooo
Here comes forever girl

This ain't no remake of a Romeo story
Ain't no werewolf trying to steal you away
I'll be your a-list, be the man on the moon cause
Me and you outta space

I'm talking bout starting out as friends
I'm talking bout real and not pretend
I'm talking bout roles of a life time
You and I can even right the end

Here comes that movie scene
The one you think is so cliché
That moment when we kissed
By the lake pouring rain
I ain't no superman
But I can change your world
Ooooooo
Here comes forever girl
Na Na Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na Na

Let's go home together
Play our roles forever
Let's grow old together
Here comes
Here comes
Here comes forever baby...

Here comes forever girl

Here comes that movie scene
The one you think is so cliche
That moment when we kissed
By the lake pouring rain
I ain't no superman
But I can change your world
Here comes forever girl
Here comes forever
Here comes forever girl
(Forever and ever and ever and ever)
Here comes forever girl
