In the dark
And I'm right on the middle mark
I'm just in the tier of everything that rides below the surface
And I watch from a distance seventeen
And I'm short of the others dreams of being golden and on top
It's not what you painted in my head
There's so much there instead of all the colors that I saw

We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh, everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything's a mess

But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream

In the eyes of a teenage crystallized
Oh, the prettiest of lights that hang the hallways of the home
And the cries from the strangers out at night
They don't keep us up at night
We have the curtains drawn and closed

We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh, everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe

That everything's a mess
But I wanna dream
I wanna dream

Leave me to dream
I know all your reasons
To keep me from seeing
Everything is actually a mess
But now I am leaving
All of us were only dreaming

Everything is actually a mess
We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh, everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything's a mess
But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream
I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream
