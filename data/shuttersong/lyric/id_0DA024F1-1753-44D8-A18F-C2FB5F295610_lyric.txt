Yeah fuck you, your momma and everything else
Free the goat!

[Hook:]
That's my best friend, that's my best friend, bless em
Big ol' booty bitch missus from Texas, what's next is
I'm gon' skeet off, lil nigga come catch me, catch me
And that's my bestie, my bestie, my best friend, go best friend
Nigga livin' TTG and everything is still on fleek
Bad bitch rollin' with' me, she gon' smile cause she on fleek
Hundred thousand dollars inside my pants, my shit on fleek
Hey-yeah!

[Verse 1:]
Take them boys to school, swagonometry
Bitch I'm bleeding bad, like a bumble bee
Hold up! Hold it, hold it, nigga proceed
I'm a eat that booty just like groceries
Eat on that coochie, lay that bitch down like "let's do it"
No Tiger bitch, eat that wood, eat that wood
Supplier, bitch, I got pistols, no wood
I want them tacos that are Meagan Good
Helicopter choppin' with the buzz
Stuff them racks inside them if they nudge
Bang that other side, nigga curb
And my reefer louder than a speaker
Yeah my niece is hanging with The Beatles
If you ever find her, better keep her
Thirty seven cameras for the sneakers
Goin' out like awesome Beanie Sigel
Send a cop, I can't wait to mistreat 'em
Forcin' your ho, I can't wait to mislead 'em
And beat 'em, they ain't my people

I done cut back on that lean, I'm on that Hen' and D'uss¨¦
Don't do no talkin' when you see him, you better shoot in his face
I got a hundred bitches that can't wait to replace
Michael Jackson nigga, Thugger Jackson moon walkin'
The S.L.I.M.E. army tool shopping
Me a horny goat, I'm boolin' at the bull stop
No I can't get arrested cause I'm talkin' bout my necklace
I'm a put that bitch in the buck, I'm a dog, let's get stuck
My lil' sister Dora eat them Lucky Charms and give me luck
Waddup cus? Here yo' cup, call my Bloods, bring my bup
Your crew suck, don't got bucks, these ain't drugs nigga
