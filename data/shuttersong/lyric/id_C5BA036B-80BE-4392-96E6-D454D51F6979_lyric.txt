

Keep on haunting

Keep on haunting me
Keep on haunting
Keep on haunting me
I was as pure as a river
But now I think I'm possessed
You put a fever inside me
And I've been cold since you left
I've got a boyfriend now & he's made of gold

And you've got your own mistakes in a bed at home
I'm hoping you could save me now but you break and fold
You've got a fire inside but your heart's so cold
Cause I've done some things that I can't speak

(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
And I tried to wash away but you just won't leave
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
So won't you take a breath and dive in deep

(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Cause I came here so you'd come for me
I'm begging you to keep on
(Haunting)
I'm begging you to keep on

(Haunting me)
I'm begging you to keep on
(Haunting)
I know you're gonna keep on

(Haunting me)
We walk as tall as the skyline
& we have roots like the trees
But then your eyes start to wander

'Cause they weren't looking at me
You weren't looking for me
Cause I've done somethings that I can't speak
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

And I tried to wash away but you just won't leave
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
So won't you take a breath and dive in deep
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
'Cause I came here so you'd come for me
I'm begging you to keep on
(Haunting)
I'm begging you to keep on
(Haunting me)
I'm begging you to keep on
(Haunting)
I know you're gonna keep on
(Haunting me)
Cause I've done somethings that I can't speak
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
And I tried to wash away but you just won't leave
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
So won't you take a breath and dive in deep
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
'Cause I came here so you'd come for me
I'm begging you to keep on
(Haunting)
I'm begging you to keep on
(Haunting me)
I'm begging you to keep on
(Haunting)
I know you're gonna keep on
(Haunting me)
