Hit The Lights - Selena Gomez
It's the boy you never told I like you
It's the girl you let get away
It's the one you saw that day on the train
But you freeked out and walked away
It's the plane you wanna catch to Vegas
Things you swear you'll do before you die
It's the city of love that waits for you
But you're too damn scared to fly
Hit the lights  let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight  come alive
Let the moment take you  lose control tonight
Hit the lights  let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight  come alive
Let the moment take you  lose control tonight
It's the time that you totally screwed up
Still you're trying get it out your brain
It's the fight you had when you didn't make up
It's the past that you're dying to change
It's all the money the you're saving
While the good life passes by
It's all the dreams that never came true
'Cause you're too damn scared to try
Hit the lights  let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight  come alive
Let the moment take you  lose control tonight
Hit the lights  let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight  come alive
Let the moment take you  lose control tonight
It's a mad mad world  gotta make an escape
It's a perfect world  when you go all the way
Hit the lights  let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight
So let's go go go go
All the way  yeah let's go go go
Night and day  from the floor to the rafters
People raise your glasses
We could dance forever
Hit the lights  let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight  come alive
Let the moment take you  lose control tonight
It's a mad  mad world
Gotta make an escape
It's a perfect world
When you go all the way
Hit the lights
Let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight
