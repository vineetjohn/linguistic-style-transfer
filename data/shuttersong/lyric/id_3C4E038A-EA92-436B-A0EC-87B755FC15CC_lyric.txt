Bored on Friday night
Spinning 'round
just like I'm hypnotised, oh oh
Need some neon lights
Wanna feel like I'm electrified,
so help me out
Get your boyfriend's car
Come and pick me up, oh
Let's take it for a ride
What trouble can we find?
One night,
and we're gonna come and crash the party
Weren't invited
but we're feeling so outrageous
Just like we're famous
Got one night,
and we're gonna come and get it started
Now we're falling down the stairs
We act so shameless
Come on let's lose control!
One night,
and we're gonna come and crash the party
Weren't invited
but we're feeling so outrageous
Just like we're famous
Got one night,
and we're gonna come and get it started
Now we're falling down the stairs
We act so shameless
Just like we're famous
Ah ah ah oh oh
Oh ah ah ah oh oh oh
Ah ah ah oh oh
Just like we're famous
Blown up like balloons
Purple glitter flying through the air,
oh oh
Sweat drips from the roof
And you know we're Lucy
in the sky of diamonds
Music playing loud
Tripping through the crowd, oh
Put your sunglasses on
Don't care if we look dumb
One night,
and we're gonna come
and crash the party
Weren't invited
but we're feeling so outrageous
Just like we're famous
Got one night,
and we're gonna come
and get it started
Now we're falling down the stairs
We act so shameless
Come on let's lose control!
One night,
and we're gonna come
and crash the party
Weren't invited
but we're feeling so outrageous
Just like we're famous
Got one night,
and we're gonna come
and get it started
Now we're falling down the stairs
We act so shameless
Just like we're famous
Ah ah ah oh oh
Oh ah ah ah oh oh oh
Ah ah ah oh oh
Just like we're famous
Ah ah ah oh oh
Oh ah ah ah oh oh oh
Ah ah ah oh oh
Just like we're famous
One night,
and we're gonna come and crash the party
Weren't invited
but we're feeling so outrageous
Just like we're famous

Now we're falling down the stairs
We act so shameless
Just like we're famous
Ah ah ah oh oh
Oh ah ah ah oh oh oh
Ah ah ah oh oh
Just like we're famous
Ah ah ah oh oh
Oh ah ah ah oh oh oh
Ah ah ah oh oh
