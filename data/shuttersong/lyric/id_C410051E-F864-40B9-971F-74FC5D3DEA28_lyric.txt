 I see the place that we belong together, together
Like  we were something more
And it felt like maybe  we could last forever,forever
But you led them to our hideout,Forced their way inside
Now,They want us to surrender,us to surrender
But  I could go all night right here between their crossfire
 We'll send them up a message
 I'll send a message
Saying,"Give it up, give it up."
 We've got no  place to go caught up in a rodeo
Oh no,Please,god,tell me  we're dreaming
 We've got nowhere to run,they've all got loaded guns
Oh no,Please,god,tell me  we're dreaming
Please,god,tell me  we're dreaming
Please,god,tell me  we're dreaming
Wait for  the dust to settle down around us,around us
And stick to what  we know
 I think  the air is finally safe to breathe again
To breathe again
 The world is in your palm now,
So take a breath and calm down
Cause you have been selected,you've been selected
A few will ever find out
And if you don't  see why,well,
At least you got your nest and, you've got your nest and
So live it up,live it up
 We've got no  place to go caught up in a rodeo
Oh no,Please,god,tell me  we're dreaming
 We've got nowhere to run,they've all got loaded guns
Oh no,Please,god,tell me  we're dreaming
Please,god,tell me  we're dreaming
Oh, ah,Please,god,tell me  we're dreaming
Oh, ah,Please,god,tell me  we're dreaming
 We've got no  place to go
 We've got nowhere to run
Oh no,Please,god,tell me  we're dreaming
(dreaming)
Please,god,tell me  we're dreaming
Please,god,tell me  we're dreaming
Please,god,tell me  we're dreaming
