Don't look down
Cause its easier falling from force
Just letting it take natures course
Then picking it up when its over

Don't be afraid
Cause the chances are there for the take
But treasure the choices you make
I know when you must take it slower

You may think you've had it rough
And try to give it up
But when you think your stuck
Just go another way

Don't let go of good times and let the
Bad ones know you feel fine
And wear you heart out on your sleeve
Love is all
Love is all you need

Don't be rushed
Cause hurrying causes mistakes
And make sure to give more then take
Cause sharing yourself brings you closer

You may think you've had it rough
And try to give it up
But when you think your stuck
Just go another way

Don't let go of good times and let the

Bad ones know you feel fine
And wear your heart out on your sleeve
Love is all you need

Feel with all your senses
Make sure to let down your defenses
There's just one way to make it seem
That love is all
Love is all you need

Take a chance now
Cause its easy
Take a chance now for you and me
Take a chance now
You can reach it
Take a chance with me

Don't let go of good times and let the
Bad ones know you feel fine
And wear your heart out on your sleeve
Love is all you need
Feel with all your senses
Make sure to let down your defenses
There's just one way to make it seem
Love is all
Love is all you need
Oh, its all you'll need
Love is all
Love is all
Love is all you need
