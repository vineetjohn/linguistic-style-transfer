"Young God"

He says, "Oh, baby girl, you know we're gonna be legends
I'm the king and you're the queen and we will stumble through heaven
If there's a light at the end, it's just the sun in your eyes
I know you wanna go to heaven but you're human tonight"

And I've been sitting at the bottom of a swimming pool
For a while now, drowning my thoughts out with sounds

But do you feel like a young God?
You know the two of us are just young gods
And we'll be flying through the streets with the people underneath
And they're running, running, running
But do you feel like a young God?
You know the two of us are just young gods
And we'll be flying through the streets with the people underneath
And they're running, running, running again

(And we'll be running, running, running again)
(And we'll be running, running, running)

He says "Oh, baby girl, don't get cut on my edges
I'm the king of everything and oh, my tongue is a weapon
There's a light in the crack that's separating your thighs
And if you wanna go to heaven you should fuck me tonight"

And I've been sitting at the bottom of a swimming pool
For a while now, drowning my thoughts out with sounds

But do you feel like a young God?
You know the two of us are just young gods
And we'll be flying through the streets with the people underneath
And they're running, running, running
But do you feel like a young God?
You know the two of us are just young gods
And we'll be flying through the streets with the people underneath
And they're running, running, running again

(And we'll be running, running, running again)
(And we'll be running, running, running)
