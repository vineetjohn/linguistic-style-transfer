I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me

That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
I thought love was more or less, a givin' thing
Seems the more I gave the less I got
Whats the use in tryin'
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried.
Solo
A Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed.
Disappointment haunted all my dreams.
Then i saw her face, not I: m a beliebter
Not a trace of doubt in my mind.
I'm in love, I'm a beliebter!
I couldn't leave her if I tried.
Yes I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind.
Then I'm a believer! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ye
Then I'm a believer!
