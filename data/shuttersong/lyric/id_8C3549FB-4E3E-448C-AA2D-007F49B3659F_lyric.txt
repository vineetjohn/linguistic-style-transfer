People tell me to be cautious
People tell me not to lose myself control
People tell me to be flawless
People tell me not to let myself evolve?

And I think I don't really get it
I think it's all just a peculiar game
And soon, I'll wake up and I'll forget it
And everyone will know me by a different name

I wanted to be stronger
I wanted to be everything for you
If I could be stronger, would you believe
That I could love you like you want me to

Love you like you want me to
Love you like you want me to

I held my breath to keep time
I tried to keep myself dry
But did I ask too much?
If I could do it again,
Would you believe what I said
That I still want that rush

And I think I don't really get it
I think it's all just a peculiar game
Soon, I'll wake up and I'll forget it
And everyone will know me by a different name

I wanted to be stronger
I wanted to be everything for you
If I could be stronger, would you believe
That I could love you like you want me to

I wanna be strong for you
Love you like you want me to... you like you want me to
I wanna be strong for you
Love you like you want me to

I wanna be strong for you
And I can, yes I can
If only you can promise that you will try too
I'll be there, I'll be there

I wanna be strong for you
If only you can promise that you will try too
I'll be there, I'll be there

I wanted to be stronger
I wanted to be everything for you
If I could be stronger, would you believe
That I could love you like you want me to

I wanted to be stronger
I wanted to be everything for you
If I could be stronger, would you believe
That I could love you like you want me to

Love you like you want me to
Love you like you want me to
Love you like you want me to
Like you want me to...
