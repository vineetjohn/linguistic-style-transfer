I'm coming 'round
And now my vision is so clear
If I could change my state of mind
Then I would disappear

The love I get from you
Is something I can't change
And I could let you slip away
Without a second glance

Why can't I realize
I'm fighting for my life?
Why can't I realize

I'm fighting for my life?
This is like a flashback
This is like a dream

This is like all the things you can fit
Inside a memory
This is like a flashback

This is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit

Inside a memory
This is like a flashback, flashback
This is like a flashback, flashback)

Why can't I realize
I'm fighting for my life?

Why can't I realize
I'm fighting for my life?
This is like a flashback
This is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit
Inside a memory
This is like a flashback
This is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit
Inside a memory
