Am I better off dead, am I better off a quitter
They say I'm better off now, than I ever was with her
As they take me to my local down the street
I'm smiling but I'm dying trying not to drag my feet

They say a few drinks will help me to forget him
But after one too many I know that I'm never
Only they can see where this is gonna end
They all think I'm crazy but to me it's perfect sense

And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
Cause I'm shouting your name all over town
I'm swearing if I go there now
I can change your mind turn it all around
And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred so I
Dial her number and confess to her
I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing
(Nothing, nothing …)

So I stumble there, along the railings and the fences
I know if I'm face to face that she'll come to her senses
Every drunk step I take leads me to her door
If she sees how much I'm hurting
She'll take me back for sure

And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
Cause I'm shouting your name all over town
I'm swearing if I go there now
I can change your mind turn it all around
And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred so I
Dial her number and confess to her
I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing

(Nothing, nothing …)
She said nothing (nothing nothing)
Oh I wanted words but all I heard was nothing

Oh I got nothing (nothing nothing)
I got nothing (nothing nothing)
Oh I wanted words but all I heard was nothing

Oh sometimes love is intoxicating
Oh you're coming down your hands are shaking
When you realize there's no one waiting
Am I better off dead

Am I better off a quitter
They say I'm better off now
Than I ever was with her
And my mates are all there trying to calm me down

Cause I'm shouting your name all over town
I'm swearing if I go there now
I can change your mind turn it all around
And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred so I
Dial her number and confess to her
I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing
(Nothing, nothing …)
She said nothing (Nothing, nothing …)
Oh I wanted words but all I heard was nothing
Oh I got nothing (Nothing, nothing …)
I got nothing (Nothing, nothing …)
Oh I wanted words but all I heard was nothing
Oh I got nothing (Nothing, nothing …)
I got nothing, I got nothing
