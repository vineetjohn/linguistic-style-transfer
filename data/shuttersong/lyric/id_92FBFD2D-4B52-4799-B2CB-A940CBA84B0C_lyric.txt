U work so hard, U really do
I don't think that anyone could ever work as hard as U
Hot desert sun, U can feel the heat
Every drop of sweat on your brow is what I am so U best believe

I got 1, 000 hugs and kisses 4 U when U come back home, baby (Ooh woo)

Turn the page
When U give 'em your all, and still it's only second best
U can come and lay your head upon your baby's chest
Every one of your worries, all your miseries (All your miseries)
U can put them in the little book and ship them off 2 sea

Cuz...

Ohh, ah, yeah
I got a 1, 000 hugs and kisses U when U come back home

Come here!
The world can be, well 2 put it frankly, such a bitch sometimes
Seems like love that lasts 4ever is so damn hard 2 find
Seems like all we ever find is another reason 2 cry

As long as U got me I got your back and this is why
U work so hard, U really do
I don't think that anyone could ever work as hard as U
Better lock the door, U better turn off the phone

Cuz I'm gonna give 1, 000 reasons why we need 2 be alone
