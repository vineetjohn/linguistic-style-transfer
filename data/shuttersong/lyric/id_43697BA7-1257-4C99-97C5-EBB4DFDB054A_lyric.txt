Uh... huh
Yeah!
Tell me am I going crazy? (Uh... huh)
Tell me have I lost my mind? (Yeah!)
Am I just afraid of lovin'? (Uh... huh)
Or am I not the lovin' kind? (Yeah!)

Kissin' in the moonlight,
Movies on a late night,
Gettin' old.
(Uh... huh)

I've been there, done that.
Supposed to be hot,
But it's just cold.
(Yeah!)

Somebody wake up my heart,
Light me up,
Set fire to my soul, yeah. (Uh... huh)
Cause' I can't do it anymore. (Yeah!)

Gimme that can't sleep love
(Gimme that can't sleep)
I want that can't sleep love
(Gimme that can't sleep)

The kind I dream about all day,
The kind that keeps me up all night.
Gimme that can't sleep love.
(Yeah!)

Maybe I'm too picky, honey. (Uh... huh)
But I'm not in the world you're in. (hah, hah, hah)
I'm not in it for the money, ooooh
I'm your looking for the real thing.
(Yeah!)

Kissin' in the moonlight,
Movies on a late night,
Gettin' old.
(It's gettin' old!)

I've been there, done that.
Supposed to be hot,
But it's just cold.
(So, so, so cold!)

Somebody wake up my heart,
Light me up,
Set fire to my soul. (to my soul, to my soul, to my soul.)
Cause' I can't do it anymore, noooo...

Gimme that can't sleep love
(Gimme that can't sleep)
I want that can't sleep love
(Gimme that can't sleep)

The kind I dream about all day,
The kind that keeps me up all night.
Gimme that can't sleep love.
(Yeah!)

Oh, I'm tired of dreaming I'm no one. (I'm tired.)
I need some body next to mine. (I-I'm tired, yeah!)
Cause I'm dyin' to give it to someone, (give it to someone...)
Because I can't do it anymore!

Gimme that can't sleep love
(Gimme that can't sleep)
I want that can't sleep love
(Gimme that can't sleep)

The kind I dream about all day, (about all day)
The kind that keeps me up all night. (keeps me up all night)
Gimme that can't sleep love.
(Yeah!)
