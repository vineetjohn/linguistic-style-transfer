Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down
Oh, I'll never know what makes this man
With all the love that his heart can stand
Dream of ways to throw it all away

Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down
Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees

Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees

Whoa gravity, stay the hell away from me
Whoa gravity has taken better men than me
How can that be?

Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
C'mon keep me where the light is

C'mon keep me where the light is
C'mon keep me where, keep me where the light is
