When night has become the day
They're sending you far away
So, so far away
When everything starts to fade
You don't have to be afraid
No, you don't have to be afraid

Take my hand and reload
This is free love
That's what we are made of
Yes we are-are-are
Reload
This is real love
That's what we are made of
Yes we are-are-are

[Beat Drop]

Take my hand and reload
This is free love
That's what we are made of
Yes we are-are-are

When you wanna get off the ground
But gravity pulls you down
Gravity pulls you down
And when you feel out of place
You don't have to be afraid
No you don't have to be afraid

Take my hand and reload
This is free love
That's what we are made of
Yes we are-are-are
Reload
This is real love
That's what we are made of
Yes we are-are-are

[Beat Drop]

Take my hand and reload
This is free love
That's what we are made of
Yes we are-are-are
Reload
This is real love
That's what we are made of
Yes we are-are-are
