Here we are

We've come so far

A fine romance

Of steppin' out to dance.

Your lovely charms

When you're in my arms

That subtle glance

When steppin' out to dance.

Could you think it over?

When we get older

I'll still want you here with me

Darling I hope that you agree

There's something that takes place

Whenever we embrace

I'm hoping that you take this chance

Of steppin' out to dance
