When I walk on by, girls be looking like damn he fly
I pay to the beat, walking on the street with in my new lafreak, yeah
This is how I roll, animal print, pants out control
It's real fool with the big afro
They like bruce lee rock at the club

Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body
I work out
Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body
I work out

When I walk in the spot, this is what I see
Everybody stops and they staring at me
I got passion in my pants and I ain't afraid to show it
(show it, show it, show it...)

I'm sexy and I know it
I'm sexy and I know it

When I'm at the mall, security just can't fight them off
When I'm at the beach, I'm in a speedo trying to tan my cheeks
This is how I roll, come on ladies it's time to go
We hit it to the bar, baby don't be nervous
No shows, no shirt, and I still get service
