I'm not saying
I'm not sorry
Just looking for another you
It's not getting any better
But what can I do?
When there's something wrong
When we keep holding on to the best days
I'm not saying
I'm not sorry
Just looking for another you

Looking for another you
Just looking for another you
Another, another you
Just looking for another
Looking for another you

Just looking for another
Looking for another you

I don't know any other way to show
It's not getting any better
I think we both know that
There's something wrong
When we keep holding on to the best days
I'm not saying
I'm not sorry
Just looking for another you

(I'm just looking for another) Looking for another you
(I'm just looking for another) Looking for another you
(I'm just looking for another) Looking for another you
Looking for another you
