I remember when it used to be simple
But all this cash it just complicates things
And all this money we into
It will drive you crazy but it only makes me go harder
Grow stronger and get tougher when the road get longer
Sometimes you gonna think that it's too much on ya
But think what id be doing I'd this wasn't going on
So I just keep pushing when im being pulled in every direction
Now I'm popping so the they watching every step of my progression
Sometimes fame like a curse latched to my blessing
On the road to the riches turning earth into heaven
Dear lord if you hear me I don't need another a new friend near me
Cause I don't want none of that fake love
Cause I'm looking and all of that be made up

I remember when I wasn't this big
And now ya'll wanna act like ya'll helped me get here
Oh now everybody wanna love me
Try knock me down but I'm strong
I did all this on my own

Ain't got no time for no new friends

So for now just leave me alone
I don't need ya'll anyway
I don't need ya'll anyway
I don't need ya'll anyway

I don't need ya'll anyway
I don't need ya'll anyway

I don't need ya'll anyway
I don't need y'all
Making each and every song like it might be my last one
But still making sure the cash come
Still ain't forgetting times when I didn't have none
Back against the wall feeling like I had to grab some
That's when, I took time and I figured it out
I'd rather deal with the stress more then living without
Take a one way trip to the top one time
Let you have it for a minute now I want mine
Same girl on the cover of the magazine
Was the one hiding pain that you haven't seen
Talking Bout

No money, no family Sixteen in the middle of Miami
Same critics on me now days couldn't stand me
Now we talking about vma's and the grammys

We've been time turn nothing into something
And so now I need money, put it all in my discussions
I remember when I wasn't this big

And now ya'll wanna act like ya'll helped me get here
Oh now everybody wanna love me
Try knock me down but I'm strong
I did all this on my own

Ain't got no time for no new friends

So for now just leave me alone
I don't need ya'll anyway
I don't need ya'll anyway
I don't need ya'll anyway
I don't need ya'll anyway

I don't need ya'll anyway
I don't need ya'll anyway
I don't need y'all
And if you wasn't here when I was down

Then you won't be here when I'm up
Now the same one you looked over
Be the same one that blew up
Ain't it funny how this life thing works
When you think it's finished is when it all begins
Go from doubts to having the thought it might work

It goes up and down then it starts again
When I reminisce sometimes I can't even keep a dry eye
But my hearts on fly by when you on top of the world sky high
I remember when I wasn't this big
And now ya'll wanna act like ya'll helped me get here
Oh now everybody wanna love me
Try knock me down but I'm strong
I did all this on my own
Ain't got no time for no new friends
So for now just leave me alone
I don't need ya'll anyway
I don't need ya'll anyway
I don't need ya'll anyway
I don't need ya'll anyway
I don't need ya'll anyway
I don't need ya'll anyway
I don't need y'all
