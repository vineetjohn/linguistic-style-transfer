I'm working 9 to 5
It's like I'm buried alive
My boss is always on my case and I hate him


He's got a Mercedes Benz,
With really lame ass rims
And I'm stuck at the bus stop waiting!

His girlfriend is 18, and my girl dumped me
She said 'You can't afford me' and went for the money, the money, money, money,

I wish I was a Rock Star, (Oh Oh)
Breaking all the girls hearts (Oh Oh)
If I was Eddie Vedder (Oh Oh)
I bet you'd like me better (Oh Oh)
Doing shots of Petrone,
With P! nk and Emma Stone
And the paparazzi stalk us when they carry me home
I wish I'd learnt to play the damn guitar

I wish I was a Rock Star (whistle)
I wish I was a Rock Star (whistle)

When I got home, it went from bad to worse,
My roomie sold my x-box for a six pack
I wanna kick his ass and get all my cash back,
But he's six foot four and a douchebag

So I'm heading to LA, with the guitar I can't play,
Hoping to someday make a lot of money, money, money, money.

I wish I was a Rock Star, (Oh Oh)
Breaking all the girls hearts (Oh Oh)
If I was Eddie Vedder (Oh Oh)
I bet you'd like me better (Oh Oh)
Doing shots of Patron,
With P! nk and Emma Stone
And the paparazzi stalk us when they carry me home
I wish I'd learnt to play the damn guitar

I wish I was a Rock Star (whistle)
I wish I was a Rock Star (whistle)

I learnt a couple of chords and kept the verses short,
It was sad but now it's kinda funny,
I wrote a catchy song that went to number 1,
About a girl that left me for the money.

Now I am a Rock Star, (Oh Oh)
Breaking all the girls hearts (Oh Oh)
Hanging out with Vedder (Oh Oh)
I bet you like me better (Oh Oh)
Doing shots of Patron,
With P! nk and Emma Stone
I bet that you wish that you could carry me home

Thank God I learnt to play the damn guitar
And I thank you for the way you broke my heart

Cos now I am a Rock Star
I am a Rock star
I'm a Rock Star!
