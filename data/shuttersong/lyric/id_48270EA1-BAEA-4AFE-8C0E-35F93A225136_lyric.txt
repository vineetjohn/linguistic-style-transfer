Glo-glo-glo-glo-ria
Yeah, ooh, oh, ooh oh, yeah

Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plain
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains

Glo-glo-glo-glo-ria
In excelsis Deo

Ooh, no, yeah, yeah
Shepards, why this jubilee
Why your joyous song prolong
What the gladsome tidings be, ohh
That inspire your heav'nly, heav'nly song, oh

Glo-glo-glo-glo-ria
In excelsis Deo

Oh oh oh, oh yeah
Oh, come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing, oh
Come adore on bended knee
Christ, the Lord, our newborn King

Glo-glo-glo-glo-ria
In excelsis Deo
Oh yeah

(Eric Dawkins & Christina Aguilera)
On the day, that Christ was born
The angels sang such a heavenly song
In excelsis Deo, ohh

Angels we have heard on high
Angels we have heard on high
Angels we have heard on high
Angels we have heard on high
In excelsis Deo
In excelsis Deo

In excelsis Deo
