Oh, no
See you walking round like it's a funeral
Not so serious, girl; why those feet cold?
We just getting started; don't you tiptoe, tiptoe, ah

Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece
You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me, ah
You're a real-life fantasy, you're a real-life fantasy

But you're moving so carefully; let's start living dangerously
Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean

Walk for me, baby
I'll be Diddy, you be Naomi - whoa oh

Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean

Hot damn
See you licking frosting from your own hands
Want another taste, I'm begging, yes ma'am
I'm tired of all this candy on the dry land, dry land, oh

Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece
You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me, ah
You're a real-life fantasy, you're a real-life fantasy
But you're moving so carefully; let's start living dangerously
Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean

Walk for me, baby (walk for me now)

I'll be Diddy, you be Naomi - whoa oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy

I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean

I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean

I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean

You're fucking delicious
Talk to me, girl
Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk for me, baby (walk for me now)
I'll be Diddy, you be Naomi - whoa oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy (that's right)
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean

Red velvet, vanilla, chocolate in my life
Funfetti, I'm ready; I need it every night
Red velvet, vanilla, chocolate in my life
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean.
