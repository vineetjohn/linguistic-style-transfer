You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lone ear
Pressed against the walls of your world

Prayin' I catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
Prayin' I catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' I catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' you catch me

Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory
It don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern
But I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

Prayin' I catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' I catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me
