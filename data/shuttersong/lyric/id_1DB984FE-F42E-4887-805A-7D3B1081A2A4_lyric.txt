 Greetings loved ones
Lets take a journey
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees
The boys
Break their necks
Try'na to creep a little sneak peek
(at us)
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in  love
Oooooh Oh Oooooh
California girls
We're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes
Bikinis  on top
Sun-kissed skin
So hot
will melt your popsicle
Oooooh Oh Oooooh
California girls
We're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce
We got it  on lock
West coast represent
Now put your hands up
Oooooh Oh Oooooh
Sex  on a beach
We get sand in our stilletos
We freak
And we're cheap
So play the songs  on the stereo
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in  love
Oooooh Oh Oooooh
California girls
We're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes
