Hands out stretch, what you got
Give me your best and I won't turn you down
Cause you're always out to impress
You're always out to impress
You're always out to impress
This is the high life, nothing dragging us through the thorns
This is the best time to be young and then reborn
Live like we're gonna die
Do things we've never done before
This is the high life, the high life
No we won't say no
Beautiful people say go go go
Beautiful people don't stress stress stress
They never rest
Beautiful people say yes
No we won't say no
Beautiful people say go go go
Beautiful people don't stress stress stress
They never rest
Beautiful people say yes
Hands out stretch, what you got
Give me your best and I won't turn you down
Cause you're always out to impress
Always out to impress
Always out to impress
So come come come with me
Let's push on 'til the break of dawn
I love to party
And when I'm with you give me some
I've got the view you see
Ready set go I drop the bomb
This is the high life
The high life
No we won't say no
Beautiful people say go go go
Beautiful people don't stress stress stress
They never rest
Beautiful people say yes
No we won't say no
Beautiful people say go go go
Beautiful people don't stress stress stress
They never rest
Beautiful people say yes
