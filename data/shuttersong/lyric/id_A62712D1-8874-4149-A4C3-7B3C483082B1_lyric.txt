Blame it on the weather
But I'm a mess
And this February darkness
Has me hating everyone

And I know I need your comfort
But this drama makes me sick
And the longer I lay here I know
It's harder to get up without you

Lose another day here
Lose another year here
I'm with you

Finally, something out there
That's making sense
And it's just another trend
Carefully hidden in your dress

And this cycles never ending
And this fashions overdone
And the further that I run away
The further I'll come back to shelter

Lose another day here
Lose another year here
I'm with you

You are the fire on my apartment floor
Sixteen stories, I'd rather burn than fall
And it isn't fate that took us all by storm
It's just the turn of a card

Lose another day here
Lose another year here
I'm with you

You are the fire on my apartment floor
Sixteen stories, I'd rather burn than fall
And it isn't fate that took us all by storm
It's just the turn of a card

Goodbye old friend
Goodbye, goodnight

I'll move on
You'll call it fate, I'll call it karma
We had our time, it was fun
While it lasted
I'll look back, with honor and no regrets
I won't be mad, won't feel bad
These memories will never leave me
Don't be sad
'Cause life goes on, life goes on
It's getting too late
Tomorrow is here
