Stars shining bright above you,
Night breezes seem to whisper, "I love you".
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me.
Say "nighty-night" and kiss me.
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me.
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me.
Stars fading, but I linger on, dear.
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear.

Just saying this:
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you.
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you.
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me.
Stars fading, but I linger on, dear.
Still craving your kiss,
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear.

Just saying this:
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you.
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you.
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of
Dream a little dream of
Dream a little dream of me.
Dream a little dream of me.
