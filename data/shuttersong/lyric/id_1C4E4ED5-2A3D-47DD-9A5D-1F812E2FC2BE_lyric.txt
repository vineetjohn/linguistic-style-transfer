I think I'm gonna lose my mind
Something deep inside me, I can't give up
I think I'm gonna lose my mind
I roll and I roll 'til I'm out of luck, yeah
I roll and I roll 'til I'm out of luck

I'm feeling something deep inside
Hotter than a jet stream burning up
I got a feeling deep inside
It's taking, it's taking all I got, yeah
It's taking, it's taking all I got.

'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do
It's been so long, it's been so long, maybe you are fireproof
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do.

I think I'm gonna win this time
Riding on the wind and I won't give up
I think I'm gonna win this time
I roll and I roll, 'til I change my luck, yeah
I roll and I roll, 'til I change my luck

'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do
It's been so long, it's been so long, you must be fireproof
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do
'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do
It's been so long, it's been so long, maybe you were fireproof
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do.
