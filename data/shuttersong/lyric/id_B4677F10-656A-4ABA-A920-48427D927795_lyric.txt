Now go stand in the corner
And think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer

And I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say sabotage
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it

I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from
She's not a saint, and she's not what you think

She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys

On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
She lives her life like it's a party and she's on the list

She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling

She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things but
Sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me

But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
She's not a saint, and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word
She's not a saint, and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
And do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do, oh
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
C'mon show me how much better you are
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you can say sabotage
