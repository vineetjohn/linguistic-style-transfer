Dropped outta school now we dumb rich (dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (one shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (pop style)
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (lifestyle)

Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it (do not make it)
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum
(They do, they do)
And I like to finish what you think you started
Man you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started
You don't know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
All this for my family, man, I try my hardest
It's all I ever did and look where it got him
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately
You've still got my number, girl you need to call me
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way
Girl let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me cause they never got me

They still out to get me, I don't get it
I can not be got, and that's a given
Give a real nigga the number one
Even though I got like twenty-one
Cannot beat me I'm a one-of-one
Schooling your ass like one-on-one
They been out here tryna slide on me
They been out here telling lies on me
Everybody looking out for themself
But they still got they eyes on me
See me putting in the hard work now, aye
Momma doesn't have to call work now, aye
I decide when I start work now, aye
Problems hit the gym, they all work out
MVP, MVP, oh-nine all the way to sixteen
Even next season looking like a breeze
Lot of y'all ain't built for the league, yeah
Trade you off the team while you in your sleep, yeah
Y'all showed me that nothing's guaranteed
And you don't know what you started
My friend's chain so big that he look like the artist
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me cause they never got me
