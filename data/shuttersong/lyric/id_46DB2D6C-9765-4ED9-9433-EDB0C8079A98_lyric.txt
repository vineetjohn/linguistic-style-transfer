One two.

From a
I'm from a little city with expensive taste
Where the cars don't run till the engine breaks
Wasn't spending pennies on a mess of things
But invested in mess with this recipe
Couldn't quite see what the future held

And as days went by it would tell itself
Let it struggle just a little bit more

Let it struggle just a little bit more
Remember what the people said
Remember what the people said
When it's said and done
Let it go
Remember what the people said,
Remember what the people said,
When it's said and done,

Let it go.
Shouldn't try to fix if it keeps getting better
Just let it go
Forget it forever and ever and ever
Don't ever resent a letter inside a single word written
A Little change can pave lanes with the right vision
Couldn't tell what would happen next

But as the weeks went by it would turn to best
Let it struggle just a little bit more

Let it struggle just a little bit more, mhm.
Remember what the people said
Remember what the people said
When it's said and done
Let it go
Remember what the people said
Remember what the people said
When it's said and done

Let it go
If what they said was all pretend then it'd be different
If it depended on if anyone was listening
And I was listening.
And when they said what I wanted was a figment
I had to turn the other cheek but I was listening
Yeah I was listening

Listening to all
Remember what the people said
Remember what the people said
When it's said and done
Let it go
Remember what the people said
Remember what the people said
When it's said and done
Let it go
Remember what the people said
Remember what the people said
I wasn't listening, I wasn't listening
Listening at all
Remember what the people said
Remember what the people said
I wasn't listening, I wasn't listening
Listening at all
At all
At all
