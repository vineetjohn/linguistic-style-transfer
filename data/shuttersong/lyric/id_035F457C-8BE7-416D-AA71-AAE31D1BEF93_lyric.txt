The truth can hurt you
Or the truth can change you
What would truth do to you

I just wanna be happy
But if I keep on doing the things
That keep on bringing me pain
There's no one else I can blame
If I'm not happy
Wasted time but now I can see
The biggest enemy is was me

So I'm not happy

Cry yourself to sleep
Shout and raise your hands

It wont change a thing child
Until you understand

If you're tired of being the same
If you're tired of things not changing
It's time for you to get out the way
Don't get stuck in how you feel
Say Jesus take the wheel
He knows the road that you need to take
(But it only works if)
If you wanna be happy

(Look at yourself and say)
Don't you wanna be happy
I just wanna be happy

But if I keep on giving my heart

For people to tear apart
The healing will never start
So I can be happy
Will I ever be happy

Cry yourself to sleep
Shout and raise your hands
It wont change a thing child
Until you understand

I'm talking to you now say
If you're tired of being the same
If you're tired of things not changing
It's time for you to get out the way
(You been down too long)
Don't get stuck in how you feel
Say Jesus take the wheel
He knows the road that you need to take
(I feel different right here)
It's so easy to complain
Addicted to the pain
You give you heart, they push it away
(But I got good news for ya)
Jesus knows just how you feel
Just let him take the wheel

The love you need, he already gave
(But the question is)
Do you wanna be happy
(If you're tired of you then say)
I just wanna be happy
(Now if you really mean that, open up your heart and say it)

Let me hear you say yeah
