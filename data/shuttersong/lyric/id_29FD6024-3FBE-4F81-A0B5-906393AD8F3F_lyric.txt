Top of the world, bottom of the ocean
Top of the world, bottom of the ocean
They built you up and broke you down again
So now you hope to beat the surf in

'Cause the future is not what you see
It's not where you've been to at all
The future is not what you see
It's not where you've been to at all

The future is not what it used to be
Used to be
The future is not what it used to be
Used to be

Top of the world, bottom of the ocean
Top of the world, bottom of the ocean
They lit you up and found the ground again
So now you know to beat the surf in

'Cause the future is not what you see
It's not where you've been to at all
The future is not what you see
It's not where you've been to at all

The future is not what it used to be
Used to be
The future is not what it used to be
Used to be

They buried the gold, your ancestry's sold and left
Just the residue
They buried the gold, your ancestry's sold and left
Just the mist of you

They buried the gold, your ancestry's sold and left
Just the residue
They buried the gold, your ancestry's sold and left
Just the mist of you

Now what's happened to you
Look what's happened to you
What's happened to you

Now that spring is finally here
Your hollow heart, your hollow heart
Drive through the forest and into the night
Away from the city, away from the light

Hollow heart, your hollow heart
You know
And we're worlds apart
And we're worlds apart

They gouge you out, they dug you in
They took the name right out of your mouth
Hollow heart, your hollow heart
You know
Worlds apart
And we're worlds apart
It's yourself past the fake
Into yourself past the fake
Into yourself past the fake
Into yourself past the fake
Into yourself, into yourself
Into yourself, into yourself
Into yourself, into yourself
