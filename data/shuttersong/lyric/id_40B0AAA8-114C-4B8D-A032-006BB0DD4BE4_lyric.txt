I keep falling
I keep falling for you
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball

I keep falling
I keep falling for you
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball

I was trying to take your heart
Keep it in a cardboard box
So when it gets hard
You'll never be far
And your love won't be lost
As the bridges fall apart
I still find a way to cross
And even if you are lost among the stars
Your love won't go off

For me me me me it's endless
But I need need need more of this
Can't turn away, feel it push me

And I keep falling
I keep falling for you
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball

I keep falling
I keep falling for you
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball

Like a cannonball

I can feel you take my love
And tangle it above the ground
And if the strings are cut
Nothing holds me up
Nothing takes me down

For me me me me it's endless
But I need need need more of this
Can't turn away, feel it push me

And I keep falling
I keep falling for you
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball

I keep falling
I keep falling for you
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball

Like a cannonball

When I try to fall for from your candlelight
I get lost in your maybe maybe
I'm just falling
When I try to hide from your love I can't deny with maybe maybe
It's just my calling
But and I keep falling
I keep falling for you
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball
I keep falling
I keep falling for you
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball
