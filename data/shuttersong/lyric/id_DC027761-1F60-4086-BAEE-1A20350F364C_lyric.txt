"I'm So Sorry"

About time for anyone telling you off for all your deeds
No sign. The roaring thunder stopped in cold to read

No time
I get mine and make no excuses; waste of precious breath
No time
The sun shines on everyone, everyone love yourself to death

So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved 'til you've made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top 'til you get too low

A son of a stepfather
A son of a！
I'm so sorry
A son of a stepfather
A son of a！
I'm so sorry

No lies and no deceiving, man is what he loves
I keep tryin' to conceive that death is from above

No time
I get mine and make no excuses; waste of precious breath
No time
The sun shines on everyone, everyone love yourself to death

So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved 'til you've made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top 'til you get too low

A son of a stepfather
A son of a！
I'm so sorry
A son of a stepfather
A son of a！
I'm so sorry

Life isn't always what you think it'd be
Turn your head for one second and the tables turn
And I know, I know that I did you wrong,
But will you trust me when I say
That I'll make it up to you somehow, somehow

So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved 'til you've made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top 'til you get too low

A son of a stepfather
A son of a！
I'm so sorry
A son of a stepfather
A son of a！
I'm so sorry

I'm so sorry [3x]
