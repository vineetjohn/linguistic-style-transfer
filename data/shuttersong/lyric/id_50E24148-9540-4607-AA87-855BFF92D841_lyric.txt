There she goes, there she goes, there she goes
There's nothing better than my beautiful woman
Even though, even though, even though
It's not always effort, we still fly together

To me you are more than just skin and bones.
You are elegance and freedom and everything I know

So come on and
Baby let your hair down
Let me run my fingers through it
We can be ourselves now
Go ahead, be foolish
No one's on the clock now
Lying in this simple moment
You don't gotta worry now
Just let your hair down

(Woah) Tell me when, tell me when, tell me when
When I can steal, a sweet kiss right from you
I'm diving in, I'm diving in, I'm diving in
The water's warm right here, here

To me you are more than just skin and bones.
You are elegance and freedom and everything I know

So come on and
Baby let your hair down
Let me run my fingers through it
We can be ourselves now
Go ahead, be foolish
No one's on the clock now
Lying in this simple moment
You don't gotta worry now
Just let your hair down

No one's on the clock now
Lying in this simple moment
You don't gotta worry now
Just let your hair down

You don't gotta worry, yeah, oh
Let your hair down
Woah, oh, oh, oh
It's only us here, only us here, only us here
It's only us here, only us here, only us here
It's only us here, it's only us here, it's only us here
Ooh
Ooh
