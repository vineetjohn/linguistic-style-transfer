Crashing hit a wall
Right now I need a miracle
Hurry up now I need a miracle
Stranded reaching out
I call your name but you're not around
I say your name but you're not around
I need you I need you I need you right now
Yeah I need you right now
So don't let me don't let me don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head darling I hope
That you'll be here when I need you the most
So don't let me don't let me don't let me down
D-Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down down down
Don't let me down don't let me down down down
Don't let me
Don't let me down down down
Down down down down
Don't let me down
So don't let me don't let me down
It's in my head darling I hope
That you'll be here when I need you the most
So don't let me don't let me don't let me down
D-Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down down down
Don't let me down down down
Don't let me down down down
