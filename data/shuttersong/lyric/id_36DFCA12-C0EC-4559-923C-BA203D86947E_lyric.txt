She said she don't like the news
It's all bad, it's all sad, it turns her brown eyes blue
She said she don't watch the tube
She dreams big, she sleeps in whenever she's got something else to do, she takes off her shoes

And she takes a walk through the city, look at all the pretty things she sees
She's a happy lil hippie, nothing gonna get her down
She's got a diary for the memories that she'll never read
Cause she's a happy lil hippie, nothing gonna get her down, oh
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na

And if you're quiet you can hear her
Singing all alone or dancing in the mirror
Cause she said she don't like to party, oh
With people she don't know, cause she likes to let go and take her clothes off, she takes her clothes off

Walking through the city, look at all the pretty things she sees
Cause she's a happy lil hippie, nothing gonna get her down
She got a diary for the memories that she'll never read
Cause she's a happy lil hippie, nothing gonna get her down
Na na na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na na

And if you get the chance to meet her, woah
I just hope you never leave her with a frown, woah

She says she don't like the news
It's all bad, it's all sad, it turns her brown eyes blue
