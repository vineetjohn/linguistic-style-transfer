You bring good to my lonely life, honestly
It's hard for me to look into your eyes
When, I say that I would be nothing without your love
I feel the rush and it's amazing
Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place, yeah
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way
Cause I know, all I know, all I know

I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions

Woooo, woooo, woooo

I think I've been in Hollywood for too long
Cause I can feel my soul burning, feel it burning slow
But I would be nothing without the touch
I feel the rush and it's amazing
Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all

Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way
Cause I know, all I know, all I know

I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo
I'm a prisoner to my addiction

I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo
I don't know
I get so wrapped up in a world where nothing's as it seems
and real life is stranger than my dreams.
