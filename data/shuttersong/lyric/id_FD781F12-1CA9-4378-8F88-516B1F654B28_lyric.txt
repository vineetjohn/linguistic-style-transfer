I know that it's been rough
It shows in your reflection
You've fallen out of touch
Got lost along the way
I know it's not enough
But these things they'll all get better
And even if it's tough

This is us, you know it on the inside
This is us, so you should show it on the outside
This is us, dust the dust up off your shoulders
Feet on ground, you'll come 'round
And be human again

I know that it's been hard
But even when it's hurting
You're gonna have to start
To learn to recognize
That even in the dark
There's lines between the spaces
Hiding where you are

This is us, you know it on the inside
This is us, so you should show it on the outside
This is us, dust the dust up off your shoulders
Feet on ground, you'll come 'round

You know it on the inside
So you should show it on the outside
Dust the dust up off your shoulders
Feet on ground

This is us, you know it on the inside
This is us, so you should show on the outside
This is us, dust the dust up off your shoulders
Feet on ground
You'll be human again
