Same Love (feat  Mary Lambert) - Macklemore & Ryan Lewis
When I was in the 3rd grade
I thought that I was gay
Cause I could draw  my uncle was
And I kept my room straight
I told my mom  tears rushing down my face
She's like  "Ben you've loved girls since before pre-K"
Trippin'  yeah  I guess she had a point  didn't she
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like
"Yeah  I'm good at little league"
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those who like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think its a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made  rewiring of a predisposition
Playing God
Ahh nah  here we go
America the brave
Still fears what we don't know
And God loves all His children
Is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written
35 hundred years ago
I don't know
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love  my love  my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
If I was gay
I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately
"Man that's gay"
Gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yeah  we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots
Behind the keys of a message board
A word routed in hate
Yet our genre still ignores it
Gay is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender and skin color
Complexion of your pigment
The same fight that lead people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody
There is no difference
Live on  And be yourself 
When I was in church
They taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service
Those words aren't anointed
And that Holy Water
That you soak in
Is then poisoned
When everyone else
Is more comfortable
Remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans
That have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same
But that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal
Damn right I support it
I don't know
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love  my love  my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
We press play
Don't press pause
Progress  march on 
With a veil over our eyes
We turn our back on the cause
'Till the day
That my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walkin' around the hallway
Plagued by pain in their heart
A world so hateful
Someone would rather die
Than be who they are
And a certificate on paper
Isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to startXX
No law's gonna change us
We have to change us
Whatever god you believe in
We come from the same one
Strip away the fear
Underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love  my love  my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
Love is patient  love is kind
Love is patient not cryin' on Sundays
Love is kind not crying on Sundays
Love is kind not crying on Sundays
Love is kind not crying on Sundays
Love is kind not crying on Sundays
Love is kind not crying on Sundays
