Let's dance in style,
Let's dance for a while,
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies,
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst,
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

Let us die young or let us live forever,
We don't have the power but we never say never,
Sitting in a sandpit,
Life is a short trip,
The music's for the sad man.

Forever young
I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really wanna live forever,
Forever,
Forever young?

Some are like water, some are like the heat,
Some are a melody and some are the beat,
But sooner or later they all will be gone,
Why don't they stay young?

It's hard to get old without a cause,
I don't want to perish like a fading horse,
Youth is like diamonds in the sun,
And diamonds are forever.

Forever young
I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really wanna live forever,
Forever
Or never?
Forever young
I wanna be
Forever young (forever)
Do you really wanna live forever
Forever
Or never?

So many adventures couldn't happen today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams are swinging out of the blue
We let 'em come true

Forever young
I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really wanna live forever
Forever
Or never?

Forever young
I wanna be
Forever young.
Do you really wanna live forever
Forever
Or never?
Forever young,
I wanna be
Forever young (forever)
Do you really wanna live forever (forever)
Forever
Or never?
Forever young,
I wanna be
Forever young (forever)
Do you really wanna live forever (forever)
Forever (forever)
Forever young...
