Sleepless gliding
Over the city lights
Watch us flying

Over the streets tonight

And I say
There's a way, there's a way I know
There's a way, there's a way I know
There's a way, there's a way
I know that someday we will surely find it
There's a way, there's a way I know
There's a way, there's a way I know
Someday, there's a way
Someday, there's a way I know it

Sunday morning
Watching the city sleep
Dreams are shining
Finely they're within reach
