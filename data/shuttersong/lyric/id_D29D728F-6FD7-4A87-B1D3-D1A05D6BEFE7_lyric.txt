To know her is to love her
I'm goin' undercover
To catch a glimpse but not get caught

But to see her, could be worse
If I don't get my head straight first
On second thought I guess I'll not

She's almost brighter than the sun
Seems to me to be unfair
When you consider everyone
Who pales when they compare
When they compare

Can't hold a candle to her
'Cause all the moths get in the way
And they'll begin to chew her
Entire attire until it frays

She outshines anyone
Whoever might dare to bask in
The same candlelight

Oh please, don't seat us in the back
With all the insects and the trash
She is a lady, I'm the tramp

Collecting stares from pairs close by
Then flutters in the butterfly
You just a moth drawn to the lamp

She's like an ancient artifact
Something you're lucky to have found
She'll pinch the nerves in all the necks
When she turns those heads around
Those heads around

Can't hold a candle to her
'Cause all the moths get in the way
And they'll begin to chew her
Entire attire until it frays

She outshines anyone
Whoever might dare to bask in
The same candlelight

Who may dare to bask in
The same candlelight

She's almost brighter than the sun
Seems to me to be unfair
When you consider everyone
Who pales when they compare
When they compare
Can't hold a candle to her
'Cause all the moths get in the way
And they'll begin to chew her
Entire attire until it frays
For she outshines anyone
Whoever might dare to bask in
The same candlelight
In the same candlelight
