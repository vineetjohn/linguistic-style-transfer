Austin M keep doin yo thing
Let these boys keep slippin man
I'm not into gymnastics but I'm into flippin things

I told these women that it's all about the team, Jordan and Pippen man
So if you wanna join the team
Now tell little miss thing
Dale!

When I saw her
Walking down the street
She looked so fine
I just had to speak

I asked her name
But she turned away
As she walked
All that I could say was

Mmm Mmm yeah yeah
Mmm Mmm yeah yeah
Mmm Mmm yeah yeah
All that I could say was

Mmm Mmm yeah yeah
Mmm Mmm yeah yeah
Mmm Mmm yeah yeah
All that I could say was

Rock n' roll one time, we'll make it up as we go
I know you feel it cause I mean what I said said said said
We can do whatever, do whatever we want
When she walk past me I say hey hey hey hey

So tell me where you're from, where you wanna go
But she walked past me like I ain't said a word
Stood there like man
Girl I don't usually feel some type of way
But this one hit me hard in some kind of place like man

When I saw her
Walking down the street

6 inch heels clickin up and down the street
You know she's comin in when she walks away way way way
Look I'm a big big deal, a little fun's all I need
But I can tell she don't believe what I said said said said said

So tell me where you're from, where you wanna go

She looks so good but she bad bad
You can see that back from the front front
Move it like criss cross, jump jump
Meet me in the middle of the ocean
We can find ourselves and lose our minds, rewind
Wawawawa, play
Find ourselves and lose our minds today
Austin M. and Armando acabando latinos y gringos gozando me entiendes
For those that thought that we would stop
They don't even have a mind to think with, brainless
Most of them broke but they're famous
Some got hits but they're nameless
But mamita, forget about that
When I see you
All that I could say was
Mmm Mmm yeah yeah
Mmm Mmm yeah yeah
Mmm Mmm yeah yeah
All that I could say was
