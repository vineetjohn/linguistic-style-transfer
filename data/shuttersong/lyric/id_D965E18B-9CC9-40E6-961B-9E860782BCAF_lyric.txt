I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love (oh, I need your...)

I take a deep breath every time I pass your door
I know you're there but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason you're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart

And I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear

Tell me do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love (I need your...)

Am I dreaming, will I ever find you now?
I walk in circles but I'll never figure out
What I mean to you, do I belong?
I try to fight this but I know I'm not that strong

Tell me do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight

All the years, all the times
You have never been to blame
And now my eyes are open
And now my heart is closing
And all the tears, all the lies, all the waste
I've been trying to make a change
And now my eyes are open

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you
I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong you make it right (you make it right)
I feel so high (I feel so high), I come alive (I come alive)
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love.
