You're hard to hug, tough to talk to, and I never fall asleep
When you're in my bed, all you give me is a heartbeat
I've turned into a statue, and it makes me feel depressed
'Cause the only time you open up is when we get undressed

You don't love me, big fucking deal
I'll never tell you how I feel
You don't love me, not a big deal
I'll never tell you how I feel

It almost feels like a joke to play out the part
When you are not the starring role in someone else's heart
You know I'd rather act alone than play a supporting role
If I can't get the starring role

Sometimes I ignore you so I feel in control
'Cause really, I adore you, and I can't leave you alone
Fed up with the fantasies that cover what is wrong
C'mon, baby, let's just get drunk, forget we don't get on

You like my dad, you get on well
I send my best, regards from hell

It almost feels like a joke to play out the part
When you are not the starring role in someone else's heart
You know I'd rather act alone than play a supporting role
If I can't get the starring role

I never sang for love, I never had a heart to mend
Because before the start began, I always saw the end, yeah
I wait for you to open up, to give yourself to me
But nothing's ever gonna give, I'll never set you free
Yeah I'll never set you free
It almost feels like a joke to play out the part
When you are not the starring role in someone else's heart
You know I'd rather act alone than play a supporting role
If I can't get the starring role
The starring role
