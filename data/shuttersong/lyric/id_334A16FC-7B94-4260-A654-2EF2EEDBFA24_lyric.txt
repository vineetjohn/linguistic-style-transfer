Oh, you broke my heart
I told you, I was weak for love
But then you went around
And did what you wanted to do
And now I'm crying, crying

Ooh, it seemed like everything was going fine
I found the love, that I thought was gonna last
Then I accidentally saw, a few things in your cell
I even L'O'L, man, I should've known
Why, why you're doing what you do
You, you might as well just tell the honest truth
See, I'm not really down with this
This ain't no texting sh!
Know I got no biz
But it is, what it is

I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name

I got two, ooh, ooh, letters for you
One is F, and the other one is U
'Cause what you gotta do, is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh ooh letters to choose
One is F, and the other one is U
S'M'H, I'm pressing send on you

Could've been this, could've been that
We done been there, we done been back
You ain't with it, could've said that
Why you tripping, let me hit that
I ain't trying to argue or more.
I do it all for you
You know you're my right eye
Baby, let me show you

Oh, I know what's been going on
Don't even try to act, like Mr. Super Nonchalant
What makes you think I'll stick around
I'm not as stupid as you sound
And you sound, really dumb right now
From A to Z, ooh
I got a lot of nasty things, flowing up in my head
But none of them are worth my time
You're not even worth this rhyme
And I don't, I don't give a flying

I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name

I got two, ooh, ooh letters for you
One is F, and the other one is U
'Cause what you gotta do, is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh ooh letters to choose
One is F, and the other one is U
S'M'H, I'm pressing send on you

Ooh, ooh, two, letters for you, yeah, letters for you
What you trippin' on, huh?
Girl, you know you're wrong, huh?
Don't let these girls, drive you crazy
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name
I got two, ooh, ooh letters for you
One is F, and the other one is U
'Cause what you gotta do, is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh ooh letters to choose
One of them F, and the other one is U
S'M'H, I'm pressing send on you
