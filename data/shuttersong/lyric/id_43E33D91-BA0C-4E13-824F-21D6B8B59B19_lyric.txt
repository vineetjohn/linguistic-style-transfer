"Waiting On The World To Change"

Me and all my friends 
We're all misunderstood 
They say we stand for nothing and 
There's no way we ever could 

Now we see everything that's going wrong 
With the world and those who lead it 
We just feel like we don't have the means 
To rise above and beat it 

So we keep waiting 
Waiting on the world to change 
We keep on waiting 
Waiting on the world to change 

It's hard to beat the system 
When we're standing at a distance 
So we keep waiting 
Waiting on the world to change 

Now if we had the power 
To bring our neighbors home from war 
They would have never missed a Christmas 
No more ribbons on their door 
And when you trust your television 
What you get is what you got 
Cause when they own the information, oh 
They can bend it all they want 

That's why we're waiting 
Waiting on the world to change 
We keep on waiting 
Waiting on the world to change 

It's not that we don't care, 
We just know that the fight ain't fair 
So we keep on waiting 
Waiting on the world to change 

And we're still waiting 
Waiting on the world to change 
We keep on waiting waiting on the world to change 
One day our generation 
Is gonna rule the population 
So we keep on waiting 
Waiting on the world to change 

We keep on waiting 
Waiting on the world to change
