Get jazzy on it

I'm that flight that you get on, international
First class seat on my lap, girl
Riding comfortable
Cause I know what the girl them mean
New York to Haiti
I got lipstick stamps on my passport
You make it hard to leave

Been around the world
Don't speak the language
But your booty don't need explaining
All I really need to understand is
When you talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Get jazzy on it

You know the words to my songs
No habla ingles
Our conversations ain't long
But you know what is
Cause I know what the girl them want
London to Taiwan
I got lipstick stamps on my passport
I think I need a new one

Been around the world
Don't speak the language
But your booty don't need explaining
All I really need to understand is
When you talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Get jazzy on it

Uno met a friend in Rio
Dos she was all on me, oh
Tres we can menage a three oh
Cuatro

Close to genius
Sold out arenas, you can suck my penis
Get with arenas, guns on deck
Chest to chest, tongue on neck
International oral sex
Every picture I take I pose a threat
Boat or jet, what'd you expect
Her pussy so good I bought her a pet
Anyway, everyday I'm trying to get to it
Got her saved in my phone under \
