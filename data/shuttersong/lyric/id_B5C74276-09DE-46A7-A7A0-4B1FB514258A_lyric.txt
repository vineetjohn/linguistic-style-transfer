When did we lose our way?
Easier to let it go
So many can't tell anybody
Harder to let you know
Call me when you made up your mind but you won't
Caught up in a way that you played my heart
Only love could ever hit this hard

Oh, don't be scared about it
Don't forget it was real
Do you remember the way it made you feel?
Do you remember the things it let you feel?

How do I make you stay?
When it's easier to let you go
Nobody knows what we know about it
No one needs to know
Call me when you made up your mind but you won't
Caught up in a way that you played my heart
Only love could ever hit this hard

Oh, don't be scared about it
Don't forget it was real
Do you remember the way it made you feel?
Do you remember the things it let you feel?

When you love to your limit
You gave all your given
Who you're gonna pray to when you're there?
Will you find out that there ain't no other love?
No other love for you

Oh, don't be scared about it
Don't forget it was real
Do you remember the way it made you feel?
Do you remember the things it let you feel?
Oh, when you think about it
Do you remember me?
Do you remember the way it made you feel?
Do you remember the things it let you feel?
