Down on the West Coast, they got a sayin'.
"If you're not drinkin', then you're not playin'."
But you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?

Down on the West Coast, I get this feeling like
It all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the moment, you for the moment.
Boy Blue, yeah, you.

You're falling hard, I push away, I'm feelin' hot to the touch
You say you miss me and I wanna say I miss you so much.
But something keeps me really quiet, I'm alive, I'm a lush
Your love. (Your love, your love.)

I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up.
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, Ooh baby, I'm in love.
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy, y Cubano como yo my love.
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love.
I'm in love. (I'm in love.)
I'm in love. (I'm in love.)

Mic-check
One, two.
One, two.
One, two.
Get it, girl.
