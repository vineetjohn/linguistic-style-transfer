Stop me on the corner
I swear you hit me like a vision
I, I, I wasn't expecting
But who am I to tell fate where it's supposed to go with it

Don't you blink, you might miss it
See we got a right to just love it or leave it
You find it and keep it
'Cause it ain't every day you get the chance to say

Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, we could beat the stars falling from the sky
Shining how we want, brighter than the sun

I never seen it, but I found this love, I'm gonna feed it
You better believe I'm gonna treat it
Better than anything I've ever had
'Cause you're so damn beautiful

Read it, it's signed and delivered, let's seal it
Boy, we go together like peanuts and Paydays
Marley and reggae
And everybody needs to get a chance to say

Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, we could beat the stars falling from the sky
Shining how we want, brighter than the sun

Everything is like a white out 'cause we shook-a-shook-a shine down
Even when the, when the light's out but I can see you blow
Got my head up in the rafters, got me happy ever after
Never felt this way before, ain't felt this way before

I swear you hit me like a vision
I, I, I wasn't expecting
But who am I to tell fate
Where it's supposed to go

Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, we could beat the stars falling from the sky
Shining how we want, brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, we could beat the stars falling from the sky
Shining how we want, brighter than the sun
Brighter than the sun
(Brighter than the sun)
Brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
