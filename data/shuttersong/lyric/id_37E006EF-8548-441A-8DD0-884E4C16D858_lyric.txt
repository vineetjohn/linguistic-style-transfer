Oh, he'll buy me a thorn before he buy me a rose
Be covered in dust before I'm covered in gold
He's trying it on, yeah, he's taking me out
Say what you want but I will never be told
Cause I'm in love with a monster

Friends say I'm stupid and I'm out of my mind
But without you boy, I'd be bored all the time
No, I don't really care for the same conversation
Got everything I need, and I'd rather be chasing
Chasing love with a monster

I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love with a monster
I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love with a monster
I'm in love with a monster

Wrap me in leather before you wrap me in lace
We breaking rules like we changing the game
He's trying it on, yeah, he's taking me out
Say what you want but I will never be told
I'm in love with a monster

My daddy told me, I should have better taste
But I'd rather pay to see the look on his face
No, I don't really care for the lame conversation
Got everything I need, and I'd rather be chasing
Chasing love with a monster

I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love with a monster
I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love with a monster
Sweeter you try, they don't get love from it

Ain't worth a dime cause I just don't get enough from it
(Leave it to me, don't you see, I don't run from it)
Bitter the better, hey, hey, hey, hey
You make me crazy, but I love it

You make me crazy baby, but I love it
You make me crazy, but I love it
You make me crazy baby, but I love it
I'm in love with a monster
(Everybody now)

Did you know (Did you know)
Did you know (Did you know)
Everybody loves a monster
Did you know (Did you know)
Did you know (Did you know)
Everybody loves a monster (yeah)
I'm in love (we're in love) with a monster
I'm in love

Are you in love with the monster?
I'll never find another monster
I wanna know, I wanna know
I'm in love with a monster
(Hit me, hit me, hit me
