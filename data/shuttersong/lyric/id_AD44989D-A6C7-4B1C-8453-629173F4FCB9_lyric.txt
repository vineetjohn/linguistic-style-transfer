We're not
No we're not friends
Nor have we ever been
We just try to keep those secrets in a lie
And if they find out, will it all go wrong
And heaven knows no one wants it to
So I could take the back road
But your eyes will lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me, you should know
Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends don't treat me like you do
Well I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you

We're not friends
We could be anything
If we try to keep those secrets safe
No one will find out
If it all went wrong
They'll never know what we've been through
So I could take the back road
But your eyes will lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me, you should know
That friends just sleep in another bed
And friends don't treat me like you do
Well I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you

No, my friends won't love me like you

But then again, if we're not friends
Someone else might love you too

And then again, if we're not friends
There'd be nothing I could do

And that's why friends should sleep in other beds
And friends shouldn't kiss me like you do
And I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you
Oh my friends will never love me like you
