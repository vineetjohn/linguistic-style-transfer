I must have been a fool
To love you so hard for so long
So much stronger than before

But so much harder to move on
And now the bitter chill of the winter
Still blows through me like a plague
Only to wake up with an empty bed

On a perfect summer day
My world just feels so cold
And you find yourself

Walking down the wrong side of the road
I can't lie, you're on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heartbeat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there

I wanna feel your heartbeat like yesterday
I never did my best to
Express how I really felt

And now that I know exactly what I want
You found somebody else
My world just feels so cold

And you find yourself
Walking on the wrong side of the road
I can't lie you're on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heartbeat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside

Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heartbeat like yesterday
My world just feels so cold
And I find myself
Thinking about the things I could have done

And it warms my soul
When you let me know
I'm not the only one
I can't lie you're on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heartbeat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heartbeat like yesterday
I can't lie you're on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heartbeat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heartbeat like yesterday
I can't lie you're on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heartbeat for me instead, yeah...
