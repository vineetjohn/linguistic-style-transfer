This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfr
Fucker

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
Her body's hot
Her body's like the summer
I'm in a trance or something
Her mind is not
No

As sharp as all her diamonds
She must be smoking something
I see her dancing in the streets
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
Cuz she's so fancy
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak

She never posts anything deep
Cuz she's so fancy

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
She wants it all
She's always taking something

And now I'm left with nothing
I'm ripping off, oh
I'm ripping off that bandage
Because I just can't stand it
I see her dancing on a fool
Like she's seventeen and cool
She really thinks that she can move
But it's just nasty

I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak

She never posts anything deep
Cuz she's so fancy
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
Has to have it all
Chases every star
She's so popular
(Whoo!)

Has to have it all
Chases every star
She's so popular
(Ohh)
This summer's gonna hurt
It's gonna hurt
I see her dancing in the street
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
Cuz she's so fancy
Cuz she's so fancy
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
