High from your high heel game
High heels push up ya ass last name
And you livin' in the fast lane
Eyes like an angel (goddess)
Watch my yellin' as she undress
Spotless, heartless, bad to the bone
Make me wanna go put me in the triple-X zone (zone)
Lames don't know how to talk to you
So let me walk with you, hold my hand

Not like a hooker, but more like a princess

Pull anywhere you go on Earth
