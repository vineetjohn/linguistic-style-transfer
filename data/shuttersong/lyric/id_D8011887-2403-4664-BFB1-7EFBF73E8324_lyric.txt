If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way, so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would, I would
Baby do it to the sky and lend you the keys
Let you know that you're always welcomed so that you never leave

Why you all those fancy things that you only see on tv, yeah
Run away, to a hut away, we be living the american dream
And I, know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that he want us to try

If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would

If I could make a better way, so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would, I would
Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh baby I would
To the love forever why, so that it never runs dry
Anytime you ask me why i'm smiling, say that i'm satisfied
He got his flaws and so do i, past seven, and macy pride

And though I wanna make it right

I just cant read your mind
And i, know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that he want us to try
But I know that he want us to try
If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would

If I could make a better way, so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would, I would

Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh baby I would
Yeah it's not about what I want
It's all about what you need
I know that it hurt you, but that wasnt me
And I know, and I know sometimes it's hard to see
That all we need to be
If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way, so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would, I would
Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh baby I would
