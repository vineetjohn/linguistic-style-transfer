Her name is Noelle
I have a dream about her
She rings my bell
I got gym class in half an hour

Oh, how she rocks
In Keds and tube socks
But she doesn't know who I am
And she doesn't give a damn about me

Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
Yeah, I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
Listen to Iron Maiden baby with me
Ooohoo Hoo Hooooooo

Her boyfriend's a dick
He brings a gun to school
And he'd simply kick
My ass if he knew the truth

He lives on my block
And he drives an IROC
But he doesn't know who I am
And he doesn't give a damn about me

Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
Yeah, I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
Listen to Iron Maiden baby with me
Ooohoo Hoo Hooooooo

Oh yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missing
Oh yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missing


Man I feel like mould
It's prom night and I am lonely
Lo and behold
She's walking over to me

This must be fake
My lip starts to shake
How does she know who I am?
And why does she give a damn about me?
She says, "I've got two tickets to Iron Maiden Baby
Come with me Friday, don't say maybe
I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby like you"
Ooohoo Hoo Hooooooo
Oh yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missing
Oh yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missing
