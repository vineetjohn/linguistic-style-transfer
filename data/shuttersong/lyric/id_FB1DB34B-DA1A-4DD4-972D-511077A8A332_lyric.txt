Climb on board

We몶ll go slow and high tempo

Light and dark

Hold me hard and mellow

I몶m seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure

Nobody but you, 몵body but me, 몵body but us
Bodies together

I몶d love to hold you close, tonight and always

I몶d love to wake up next to you

I몶d love to hold you close, tonight and always

I몶d love to wake up next to you

So we몶ll piss off the neighbours

In the place that feels the tears

The place to lose your fears

Yeah, reckless behavior

A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw

Be in the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
목
Fucking you, and fighting on
목
It몶s our paradise and it몶s our war zone
목
It몶s our paradise and it몶s our war zone
목
Pillow talk
목
My enemy, My ally
목
Prisoners
목
Then we몶re free, it몶s a thriller

I몶m seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure

Nobody but you, 몵body but me, 몵body but us

Bodies together

I몶d love to hold you close, tonight and always

I몶d love to wake up next to you

So we몶ll piss off the neighbours

In the place that feels the tears

The place to lose your fears

Yeah, reckless behavior

A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw

Be in the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day

Fucking you, and fighting on

It몶s our paradise and it몶s our war zone

It몶s our paradise and it몶s our war zone

Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise

War zone, war zone, war zone, war zone

Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise

War zone, war zone, war zone, war zone

So we몶ll piss off the neighbours

In the place that feels the tears

The place to lose your fears

Yeah, reckless behavior

A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw

It몶s our paradise and it몶s our war zone
