And my flow art my nigga, I’m Mozart with it
It’s all good, I do this
I turn a straight prude bitch into a nudist
Foolish I be on that new shit
And I’m blowing up like bitches we went to school with
Aint nobody checking for your garbage
Lot of intuition I aint even finish college
Never hit the mall and forever get it all
Any broad better layer like I’m dressing for the fall, nigga
And I’m all that, hit the passenger door
Shawty was Pinkberry sweet and I aint lactose
I aint tryna brag tho, I’m just know I’m that dope
Kick game Bo Jacks, my Bo Jacks Tai bo
Haha, and it aint no problem, you race to these broads

Bitches in here, one thou
But when you step out why the bitches run out
Double MG shit I put the set down

A million home sellers couldn’t find a realer state

I’mma need a yellow cab and a yellow bad bitch
Green faces but a nigga dodging yellow badges, wooop (sirens)
Cause I’m drunk, yeah ok
Under 25 living the f-cking life
White Amercia said I’ll be doing 25 to life

You make 25 a year, I make 25 a night, woah
Blucka, blucka, blucka
Bitch get hit with my Ciroc Vodka choppa
(Go) takin’ body shots, blocka, blocka, blocka
Probably in your girls dreams, probably in your daughter locker
Top floor like I’m out tanning
And they stole your whole delivery, now thats outlandish
I guess like good delivery, man, I’m outstanding
Car tinted, I’m in it, til like I’m out camping, goddamit
I’m one hell of a guy, looking down on a cloud, thats one hell of a high
Bitch, I gets ghost, the way she screaming Big
Niggas couldn’t tell if I was dead or alive
