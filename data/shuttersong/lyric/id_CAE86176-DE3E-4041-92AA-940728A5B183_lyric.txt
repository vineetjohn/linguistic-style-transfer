Mustard on the beat ho!

[Rihanna:]
I was good on my own, that's the way it was, that's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded fuck, on some faded love
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded, huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I give it to you

But, baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck your white horse and a carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you, you could have it

You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
Feel a little more and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But, baby, who, you needed me

You been rollin' around, shit, I'm rolling up
Light and roll it up
Break it down like a pound, shit was never us
Shit was never us
That's the real on the real. Are you serious?
How you feel, how you feel?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though, I give it to you

But, baby, don't get it twisted (don't get)
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck your white horse and a carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you, you could have it

You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But, baby, who, you needed me
