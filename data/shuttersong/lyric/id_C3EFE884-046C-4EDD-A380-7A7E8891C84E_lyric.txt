I get so disturbed, I'm all alone
I feel so funny talking on the phone

I fall apart when I hear you speak
Believe me girl, I just feel weak

I wonder how I got involved with a girl like
You want to tell me that I'm not you're kind of guy
You break the news and I break down and cry, I cry

You're having fun, well that's all right
I'm too weak to put up a fight
I wish you'd just tell what was wrong
Instead of leading my on

I get so disturbed when I'm all alone
I feel so funny talking on the phone
I fall apart when I hear your speak
Believe me girl, I just feel weak
I wish you'd just tell me what was wrong
Instead of leading me on

I try to call
(Call on the phone)
I try to call
(But nobody's home)
I wonder why
(You lead my along)

I wonder how I got involved with a girl like you
