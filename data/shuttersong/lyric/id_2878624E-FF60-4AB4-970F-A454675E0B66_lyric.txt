Go to sleep, wake up
You're pretty with, no make up
I like this right here
Go sleep, wake up
You're pretty with

This girl she came round the corner
Looking like a model
Magazine figure
She was shaped like a bottle
Long straight hair
She was fly as a bird
First time ever
I was lost for words
Felt so right
Couldn't be wrong
Love at first sight
If that exists at all
I couldn't move
Felt like I was stuck

And then baby girl looked up

And I said
Hey there pretty brown eyes
Whatcha doing later tonight?
Would you mind if I spend time with you?
And I said
Hey there pretty brown eyes

Whatcha doing later tonight?
Would you mind if I spend time with you?

Go to sleep, wake up
You're pretty with no make up

Go to sleep
Wake up
You're pretty with

This girl she was a little hottie
She knows she's got it
Came from the city so she loves to party
The JT song make her move that body

She's dancing all night long
I could tell that she was a wild one
That's why I was shy at first
But I finally worked up the nerve

And I said
Hey there pretty brown eyes
Whatcha doing later tonight?

Would you mind if I spend time with you?
And I said
Hey there pretty brown eyes
Whatcha doing later tonight?
Would you mind if I spend time with you?

Spend a little bit
A little bit of time with you

Spend a little bit
A little bit of time with you
Spend a little bit
A little bit of time with you
Spend a little bit
A little bit of time with you

Hey hey little pretty brown eyes
Don't cha ever be looking at them other guys
Cause ain't never had no surfer like me
Start swimming over here and ride my wave

Cause I see that you party like there's no tomorrow
Let's leave the party
I'll grab my guitar
I got the keys
So jump in my car
Sit back, relax
Australia's kinda far

Hey there pretty brown eyes
Whatcha doing later tonight?
Would you mind if I spend time with you?
And I said
Hey there pretty brown eyes
Whatcha doing later tonight?
Would you mind if I spend time with you?
Spend a little bit
A little bit of time with you
Spend a little bit
A little bit of time with you
Spend a little bit
A little bit of time with you
Spend a little bit
A little bit of time with you
