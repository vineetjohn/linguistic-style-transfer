Sat on a roof
Named every star
Shed every bruise and
Showed every scar

Sat on a roof
Your hand in mine, singing
Life has a beautiful, crazy design
And time seemed to say
Forget the world and all its weight
Here I just wanna say

Amazing day
Amazing day

Sat on a roof
Named every star and
Showed me a place
Where you can be who you are

And the view
The whole Milky Way
In your eyes
I'm drifting away
And in your arms
I just wanna sway

Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day

And I asked every book
Poetry and chime
Can there be breaks
In the chaos of times?
Oh, thanks God
You must've heard when I prayed
Because now I always
Want to feel this way

Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
