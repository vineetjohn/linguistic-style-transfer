(Derulo...)

It's too hard to sleep
I got the sheets on the floor
Nothing on me
And I can't take it no more
It's a hundred degrees
I got one foot out the door
Where are my keys?
'Cause I gotta leave, yeah

In the back of the cab
I tipped the driver ahead of time
Get me there fast
I got your body on my mind
I want it bad
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, so high

Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl, you got me
There's nothin' I, no, I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do
Just to get up next to you

Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl, you got me
There's nothin' I, no, I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do
Just to get up next to you
Just to get up next to you

You open the door
Wearing nothing but a smile, fell to the floor
And you whisper in my ear, "Baby, I'm yours."
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, so high

Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl, you got me
There's nothin' I, no, I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do
Just to get up next to you

Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl, you got me
There's nothin' I, no, I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do
Just to get up next to you
Just to get up next to you

Just the thought of you gets me so high, so high
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, so high

Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl, you got me
There's nothin' I, no, I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do
Just to get up next to you

Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl, you got me
There's nothin' I, no, I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do
Just to get up next you (I would do anything)
Just to get up next you (anything and everything)
Just to get up next to you (baby)
Just to get up next to you
Get up, get up!
