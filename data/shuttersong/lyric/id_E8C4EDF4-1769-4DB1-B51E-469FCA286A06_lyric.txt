The Girl Who Cried Wolf - 5 Seconds Of Summer
I'm not leaving
Every time you say to me it's over
You just wanna start again  it's just lies
The girl who cries wolf every day
Ignored by gravity  but in the end  don't ask why
You say you wanna  but do you wanna run away 
Your great escape  oh yeah
Where you going  Always running
Find a way to call it quits again
So look at me in the eye
Is anyone there at all
Is anyone there at all
Cause I'm not dreaming
So look at me in the eye
Is anyone there at all
Is anyone there at all
Cause I'm not leaving
Cause I'm not leaving
Does it have to be this tragedy 
This endless lost parade
A castle of facade of make believe
The truth is spelled out in your eyes
Why don't you just reach out and make it clear to me 
What are you telling me 
You say you wanna  but do you wanna run away 
Your great escape  oh yeah
Where you going  Always running
Find a way to call it quits again
So look at me in the eye
Is anyone there at all
Is anyone there at all
Cause I'm not dreaming
So look at me in the eye
Is anyone there at all
Is anyone there at all
Cause I'm not leaving
Cause I'm not leaving
Cause I'm not leaving
Is anyone there at all  Is anyone there at all 
Is anyone there  Is anyone there at all 
Is anyone there at all  Is anyone there at all 
Is anyone there at all  Cause I'm not dreaming
Is anyone there at all  Is anyone there at all 
Is anyone there  Is anyone there at all 
Look at me in the eye  is anyone there at all 
Is anyone there at all  I'm not dreaming
Look at me in the eye  is anyone there at all 
Is anyone there at all  Cause I'm not leaving
