If you want it, take it

I should have said it before

Tried to hide it, fake it

I can't pretend anymore

I only want to die alive

Never by the hands of a broken heart

I don't wanna hear you lie tonight

Now that I've become who I really am

This is the part when I say I don't want it

I'm stronger than I've been before

This is the part when I break free

Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want it

I'm stronger than I've been before

This is the part when I break free

Cause I can't resist it no more

You were better, deeper

I was under a spell

Like a deadly fear I am, babe

On the highway to hell

I only want to die alive

Never by the hands of a broken heart

I don't wanna hear you lie tonight

Now that I've become who I really am

This is the part when I say I don't want it

I'm stronger than I've been before

This is the part when I break free

Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want it

I'm stronger than I've been before

This is the part when I break free

Cause I can't resist it no more

(Our love baby, oooh)

The thought on your body

I came alive

It was lethal
It was fatal

In my dreams it felt so right

But I woke up and pretend

Oh baby
This is the part when I say I don't want it

I'm stronger than I've been before

This is the part when I break free

Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want it

I'm stronger than I've been before

This is the part when I break free

Cause I can't resist it no more
