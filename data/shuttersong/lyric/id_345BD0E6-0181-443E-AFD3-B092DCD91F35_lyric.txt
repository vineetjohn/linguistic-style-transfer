It feels just like it was yesterday
We were in love, was I falling apart?
I've never been one to walk away
But I've had enough and it's breaking my heart

'Cause you love me just the way that you should
It's nothing that you do, no, it's nothing you say

Yeah baby, I know that you're good
But I don't want a good girl, no, not today

'Cause I want it bad
I want a bad girl, baby, bad
I want a love that's crazy, yeah
I want a bad girl, baby, bad, I want it bad
I want a girl who stays out too late

And when I call she doesn't answer the phone
Oh, I want a girl who likes it her way
And through it all I know I'll end up alone
Yeah, yeah, you love me just the way that you should

It's nothing that you do, no, no, it's nothing you say
Oh pretty baby, I know that you're good
But I don't want a good girl, no, not today
'Cause I want it bad

I want a bad girl, baby, bad
I want a love that's crazy, yeah
I wanna fight
I wanna rock and roll and party all night
Yeah, I want it bad
I want a bad girl, baby, bad, I want it bad
I'm getting sick of predictable
Tired, vapid, logical

Oh yeah, I gotta shake it up tonight
Yeah girl, I want something physical
Not something invincible
Oh yeah, I'm tired of being good, let's be bad
I want a bad girl, baby, bad
I want a love that's crazy, yeah

I want a bad girl, baby, bad
I want a love that's crazy, yeah
I wanna fight
I wanna rock and roll and party all night
Yeah, I want it bad, I want a bad girl, baby, bad
I want a love that's crazy, yeah
I wanna fight
I wanna rock and roll and party all night
Yeah, I want it bad
