We roll in every summer when there's strength in our numbers
And your breath's hot and gross, but I kiss you like a lover
Like stick to the seats of the cars of mongerito
I forget the mallets from the lessons that I went to

And Jamie picks fights but the weekend's short lived
Because no one can be bothered when it's humid like this
And we roll in every summer like it's shameful to be underneath
The ceiling or a roof truck, come out and steal our thunder

Now the days are getting colder and the burning of our limbs
Doesn't happen quite as bad and the burnings dry skin
Deep in the fantasies and dreams of the wits
To like the movies that we watch to pretend it wasn't winter

And everywhere we go, I can feel the subtle taste
Of the D-talk groan and the locker room where we stayed
And you're no better at swimming than you were in the beginning
But you come over at night and we practice all the breathing

Go all the way, have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days, do your thing, do it well
This will take you down

Go all the way, have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days, do your thing, do it well
This will take you down

I'll pull the trick if I want to
I'll pull the trick and it comes true
I'm chewing gum and it's killing you
We're getting dead and it's the right way to do it

I see you happy in the front seat
I see you with all of your front teeth
You're allergic but you never said
We're getting dead and it's the right way

Go all the way, have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days, do your thing, do it well
This will take you down

Go all the way, have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days, do your thing, do it well
This will take you down.
