Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah.
Yeah yeah Ohhhhh
Everytime you're near baby
I get kinda crazy in my head for you
I don't know what to do
And oh baby
I get kinda shaky when they mention you
I just lose my cool
My friends tell me
Somethin has come over me
And I think I know what it is
I think I'm in love

Boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been doin silly things when it comes to you
In love, boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been tellin all my friends what I feel for you
Just the other night baby, I saw you hangin
You were with your crew
I was with mine too
You took me by surprise
When you turn and look me in my eyes
Boy you really blow my mind
I don't know what's gotten into me
But, I think I know what it is

I think I'm in love

Never met a guy like you before
You make me feel special inside
