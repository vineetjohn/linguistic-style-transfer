Werent't you the one who said that you don't want me anymore
And how you need your space and give the keys back to your door
And how I cry and try and try to make you stay with me
But still you said the love was gone and that I had to leave

Now you
Talking about a family
Now you
Saying I complete your dream
Now you
Saying I'm your everything
Your confusing me, what your saying to me
Don't play with me, don't play with me cause

What goes around comes around
What goes up most come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
What goes around comes around
What goes up most come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me

I remember when I was sitting home alone
Waiting for you
To 3 o'clock in the morn'

And when you came home you'd always had some sorry excuse
And explaining to me like I was some kind of a fool
I sacrifice the things I want just to do things for you
But when it's time to do for me
You never come through

Now you
Wanna be a part of me
Now you
Have so much to say to me
Now you
Wanna make time for me
What you doing to me, your confusing me
Don't play with me, don't play with me cause

What goes around comes around
What goes up most come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
What goes around comes around
What goes up most come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me

I remember when I was sitting home alone
Waiting for you
To 3 o'clock in the morn'
Night after night knowing something's going on
What's that number for b go-a-go-a-gone

Lord knows it wasn't easy believe me
Never thought you'd be the one that would deceive me
And never do what your suppose to do
No need to punch me boo cause I won't play you cause

What goes around comes around
What goes up most come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
What goes around comes around (yeah)
What goes up most come down
Gotta stop trying to come back to me
What goes around comes around
What goes up most come down
It's called Karma, baby
And it goes around
What goes around comes around
What goes up most come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
