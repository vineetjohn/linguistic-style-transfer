Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices
Inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close
Don't patronize
Don't patronize me

Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something that it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart
And I will feel the power but you won't
No, you won't
Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't

I'll close my eyes, then I won't see
The love you don't feel
When you're holding me
Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me till then
To give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something that it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart
And I'll feel the power but you won't
No you won't
Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't

Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices
Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something that it won't

Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart
I'll feel the power, but you won't
No, you won't
I can't make you love me
