[Verse 1 - Big Sean:]
You know I ain't having that shit
(Got you Bitch)
How could you be so selfish
Phone off, careless
You ain't drinking no more that's bullshit
I heard your taking more shots than a full clique
No call, no text, huh?
That's how you feel when you stressed, huh?
You know I'm from a tribe called questions
I need them answers now like it's test time
Do you realize how many good girls I lost
When I changed the number for you
When I needed that peaceful sleep and still cuddled for you
You ain't even know when times get hard I bent up the budget
I kept it subtle
Might as well put jackets over the puddles for you
You're acting irreplaceable, pfft, bitch, hardly
I feel like I chose the wrong bitch like Steve Harvey
When you back to me the morning time
You got me on the borderline
I used to want to put the work in now I feel like overtime

[Chorus - Big Sean & Jhen¨¦ Aiko:]
When I hit you late night, texting
Phone off, no stressing
How could you be so selfish
Selfish, so selfish
Phone off, no texting
No pics, no calls, no sexting
How could you be so selfish
Selfish, so selfish
I can't help it
I can't help it
I can't help it
I can't help it
So, so selfish

[Verse 2 - Jhen¨¦ Aiko:]
Why would you just play with the one who been there with you when no one would come
Can't believe I stayed faithful to somebody so ungrateful
Don't you know there's a line for my love
And you be out here lying on us
Ain't that some shit
Ain't that a bitch
And you wonder why the past has changed us
Wonder why it ain't the same for us
You keep fuckin it up it's all on you
You just made it so hard for you

[Chorus - Big Sean & Jhen¨¦ Aiko:]
Late night, texting
Phone off, no stressing
How could you be so selfish
Selfish, selfish
Phone off, texting
No pics, no calls, no sexting
How could you be so selfish
Selfish, so selfish
I can't help it
I can't help it
I can't help it
I can't help it
So, so selfish

[Outro - Big Sean & Jhen¨¦ Aiko:]
Breakdown
I think it's time to breakdown
Late night, texting
Phone off, stressing
Testing me now, stressing me out
Out, out
How could you be so
