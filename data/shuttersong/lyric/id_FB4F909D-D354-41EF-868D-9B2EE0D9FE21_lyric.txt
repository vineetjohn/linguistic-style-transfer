Far over the Misty Mountains rise

Lead us standing upon the height

What was before we see once more
Is our kingdom a distant light

Fiery mountain beneath a moon

The words aren't spoken, we'll be there soon

For home a song that echoes on

And all who find us will know the tune

Some folk we never forget

Some kind we never forgive
Haven't seen the back of us yet
We'll fight as long as we live
All eyes on the hidden door
To the Lonely Mountain
We'll ride in the gathering storm
Until we get our long forgotten gold

We lay under the Misty Mountains cold

In slumbers deep, and dreams of gold

We must awake, our lives to make

And in the darkness a torch we hold

From long ago where lanterns burned

Until this day our hearts have yearned
A fate unknown, the Arkenstone
What was stolen must be returned
We must away ere break of day
To find our song for heart and soul
Some folk we never forget
Some kind we never forgive
Haven't seen the end of it yet
We'll fight as long as we live
All eyes on the hidden door
To the Lonely Mountain
We'll ride in the gathering storm
Till we get our long forgotten gold
Far away the Misty Mountains cold
