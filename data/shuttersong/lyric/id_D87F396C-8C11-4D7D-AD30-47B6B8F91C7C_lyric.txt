If you're the only thing I ever get for christmas
Then everything I wished for has come true
You're the single item on my list
You're my one and only christmas wish
The mistletoe is where I'll be waiting, meet me there

I know someone out there knows what I'm saying
Baby you're a girl who's wishing just like me (yeah, yeah)
There is one, and you know who you are
My gift to you is all my heart
Make my holiday, and hear me when I say

If you're the only thing I ever get for christmas
Then everything I wished for has come true
You're the single item on my list
You're my one and only christmas wish
The mistletoe is where I'll be waiting, meet me there

In the morning I know everybody's rushing
To see what's underneath the christmas tree
Know what I mean, cuz I don't find it there
Underneath the mistletoe is where
You make my holidays, so hear me when I say

If you're the only thing I ever get for christmas

Then everything I wished for has come true
You're the single item on my list
You're my one and only christmas wish
The mistletoe is where I'll be waiting, meet me there

Only you can make this... a merry merry christmas

There is one, and you know who you are
My gift to you is all my heart
Make my holiday, and hear me when I say

If you're the only thing I ever get for christmas
Then everything I wished for has come true
You're the single item on my list
You're my one and only christmas wish
The mistletoe is where I'll be waiting, meet me there
All I ever wanted was you, this christmas
Yeah yeah yeah
I need you baby
You're the single item on my list
You're my one and only christmas wish
The mistletoe is where I'll be waiting, kiss me there
I'll be waiting, kiss me there...
