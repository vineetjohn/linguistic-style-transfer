Ooh, the rhythm takes you over
Takes you to a different place
A different space
Ooh, the smoke is getting closer
I can feel our young blood race
Through cityscapes

And everybody wants to be touched
Everybody wants to get some
But don't you play a song about love
When I move my body
I don't have to talk about none
Let the camera go do its stuff
Till the energy's too much

Yeah all I need
Is the rhythm, me & the rhythm
Nothing between
Yeah the rhythm, me & the rhythm

And I know, I know, I know
I can't fight it
I won't, I won't, I won't
Deny it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'd be lying
If I said I didn't need
Yeah the rhythm, me & the rhythm

Ooh, I start to feel it now
Feeling like I'm truly free
I'm free in me
Ooh, the heat's a common ground
No matter what's your history
Be free with me

And everybody wants to be touched
Everybody wants to get some
But don't you play a song about love
When I move my body
I don't have to talk about none
Let the camera go do its stuff
Till the energy's too much

Yeah all I need
Is the rhythm, me & the rhythm
Nothing between
Yeah the rhythm, me & the rhythm

And I know, I know, I know
I can't fight it
I won't, I won't, I won't
Deny it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'd be lying
If I said I didn't need
Yeah, the rhythm
Me & the rhythm

If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark
If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark
If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark
If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark

Yeah all I need
Is the rhythm, me & the rhythm
Nothing between
Yeah the rhythm, me & the rhythm
And I know, I know, I know
I can't fight it
I won't, I won't, I won't
Deny it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'd be lying
If I said I didn't need
Yeah, the rhythm
Me & the rhythm
