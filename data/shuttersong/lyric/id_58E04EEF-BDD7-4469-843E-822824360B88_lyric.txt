And all I wanna do is to fall in deep

But close ain't close enough 'til we cross the line baby

So name a game to play and I'll role the dice hey

Oh baby look what you started

The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen

Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Woo oh oh oh
Before I make a move
Woo oh oh oh

So baby come light me up and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous but baby that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
Cause I'm so into you into you into you
Got everyone watchin' us so baby let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous but baby don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
Cause I'm so into you into you into you oh yeah
