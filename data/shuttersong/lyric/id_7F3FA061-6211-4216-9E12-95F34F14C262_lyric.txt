I am so fab
Check out, I'm blonde, I'm skinny, I'm rich
And I'm a little bit of a bitch

I wanna dress you up in silk taffeta
Tailor these clothes to fit your guilt, what's your size?
This purse can hold my black card and tiara
Versace promises I will Dolce Vita

What do you wanna wear this spring?
What do you think is the new thing?
What do you wanna wear this season?

Donatella
(I'm smokin' 'em on full tank of gas)
Mi-mi-bella
(I'm a rich bitch, I'm the upper class)
All of the day
(I'm the pearl to your oyster, I'm a babe)
I'm gonna smoke Marlboro Lights and drink champagne
(I smoke Marlboro Reds and drink champagne)

Donatella
Cuz she walks so bad like it feels so good
Listen to her radiate her magic
Even though she knows she's misunderstood
Voodoo voodoo, voo-don-na-na

Walk down the runway but don't puke, it's ok
You just had a salad today, boulangerie
Just ask your gay friends their advice before you
Get a spray tan on holiday in Taipei

What do you wanna wear this spring?
What do you think is the new thing?
What do you wanna wear this season?

Check it out
Take it in
Cuz that bitch
She's so thin (voo-don-na-na)

She's so rich
And so blonde
She's so fab
It's beyond

What do you wanna wear this spring?
What do you think is the new thing?
What do you wanna wear this season?

Donatella, ooh
Donatella, ooh
All of the day, ooh
I'm gonna wear designer and forget your name
