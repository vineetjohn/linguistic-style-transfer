We go hideaway in daylight
We go undercover, wait out the sun
Got a secret side in plain sight

Where the streets are empty
That's where we run

Everyday people do
Everyday things, but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now

Me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you

We could be

They don't see it 'cause they don't understand
Spinning round and round for hours

Everyday people do
Everyday things, but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now
We are a different kind
We can do anything

We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you

We could be

We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be

All we're looking for is love and a little light
Love and a little light
We could be
All we're looking for is love and a little light
Love and a little light

We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be
