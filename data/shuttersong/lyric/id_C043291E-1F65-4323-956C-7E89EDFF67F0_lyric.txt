I was bound, was tired
Hadn't seen a light so long
Thought I lost my fight
Couldn't find my way back home
And I felt the light stepping out of me
I was bound, and tired
Waiting for daylight (Daylight, daylight, and I...)

Bang my head against the wall
Though I felt light headed, now I know I will not fall
I will rise above it all
Found what I was searching for
Though I felt light headed
I should've failed, and nailed the floor
Instead I rose above it all

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Bang my head against the wall
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Instead I rose above it all
(Bang my head against the wall)

When you think you're giving up, just know
You might think you're dying but you won't
And you feel the life stepping out of you
But when you think of giving up, don't (Oh)

Bang your head against the wall
You may feel light headed, but you won't crawl, no, you won't fall
You will rise above it all
You'll find what you're searching for
And you may feel light headed
You think you're gonna hit the floor
Instead you rise above it all

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Bang your head against the wall
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Instead you rise above it all
(Bang my head against the wall)

I have broken wings
I keep trying, keep trying
No I won't give up
Oh I'm flying, oh I'm flying

Bang my head against the wall
Though I feel light headed, now I know I will not fall
I will rise above it all
Found what I was searching for
Though I felt light headed
I should've failed, and nailed the floor
Instead I rose above it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Bang my head against the wall
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Bang my head against the wall (Ooh)
Bang my head against the wall (Ooh)
Instead I rise above it all.
