Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh.

I think about all the time
Think you may need all of mine
Hate to say you know that love is blind
I'm 'bout to see, I'll close my eyes
(Truth is) They can't see you in here though
Most of them need dollar signs to make
Every day your birthday

And every night your Valentine…
If we tried that we could be
Somewhere the climate is warm, long as you around me
I swear that everything will be just fine
I wish that we could take some time
Go anywhere, baby I don't mind
Grown man, in my suit and tie
Hey, there's no oui without you and I
Oh, yea, ah yea, ah ah yea
Hey, there's no oui without you and I
Oh yea, ah yea, ah ah yea

Hey, there's no oui without you and I
See my baby know, where my baby go, I go
It's no better feeling, you know when I'm next to her for sure
Oh how can they hate? Gotta get this off my chest
Oh girl, I think I love you, I swear your shit look best

Friends, they know they hate, they don't get the best

Ah yea, I think I love you, oh baby maybe
If we tried that we could be
Somewhere the climate is warm, long as you around me
I swear that everything will be just fine
I wish that we could take some time
Go anywhere, baby I don't mind
Grown man, in my suit and tie
Hey, there's no oui without you and I
Oh, yea, ah yea, ah ah yea

Hey, there's no oui without you and I
Oh yea, ah yea, ah ah yea

Hey, there's no oui without you and I

Oohh, da du du du du
Oohh, da du du du du
Oohh, da du du du du

Oohh, da du du du du
