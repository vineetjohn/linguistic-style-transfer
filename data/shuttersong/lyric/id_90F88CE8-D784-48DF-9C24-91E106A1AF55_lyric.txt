I don't know how i got here

I knew it wouldn't be easy
But your faith in me was so clear
It didn't matter how many times i got knocked on the floor
But you knew one day i would be standing tall
Just look at me now

Cause everything starts from something

But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would i be, if you didn't believe
Believe...
There were days when out you spoken, you know
There were nights when i was doubting myself
But your kept my heart from falling
It didn't matter how many times i got knocked on the floor
But you knew one day i would be standing tall
Just look at us now
Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would i be, if you didn't believe
Where would i be, if you, if you didn't believe
Would you know, how i feel touch the sky, if you didn't believe
Believe, believe
It didn't matter how many times i got knocked on the floor
You knew one day i would be standing tall
Just look at us now
Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would i be, if you didn't believe, yeah
Where would i be, if you, if you didn't believe
Would you know, how i feel touch the sky, if you didn't believe
Where would i be, if you didn't believe
