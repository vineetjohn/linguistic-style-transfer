Subjected to my system
Reflecting on the days
When we used to be just friends
Protected both our interest
Our trust was in a bank
That's where our hearts were safe

And then we got closer
Separated from my ex
So we got closer
Oh, in every visit
Feelings got stronger
Now this is out our hands

Our love is here to stay

So get used to me checking in
All day
Get used to me falling through
Just to see your face
There ain't a moment
I won't need your brace
Get used to me touching you
Get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, eh
Oh get used to it, eh
Oh get used to it, oh and oh
Get used to me holding you

Get used to me woeing you
Oh get used to it

And I'ma April shower you
Forever if I May
'Til your flowers bloom in June
Make sure that our fireworks

Be your 4th of July
For life
As long as you stand right by my side

Keep growing closer

Throughout October
Oh counting down, it's almost Christmas Eve
Oh seven days shy of New Year's Eve
Then we'll be celebrating

So get used to me checking in
All day
Get used to me falling through
Just to see your face
There ain't a moment
I won't need your brace
Get used to me touching you
Get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, eh

Oh get used to it, eh
Oh get used to it, oh and oh
Get used to me holding you
Get used to me woeing you
Oh get used to it

I ain't going nowhere
I ain't going nowhere, oh no

I ain't going nowhere
I ain't going nowhere, oh no
Put your faith in me
I'll be all you need, I swear
Yeah yeah
I'm gonna be right here, yeah

So get used to me checking in
All day
Get used to me falling through
Just to see your face
There ain't a moment
I won't need your brace
Get used to me touching you

Get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, eh
Oh get used to it, eh
Oh get used to it, oh and oh
Get used to me holding you
Get used to me woeing you
Oh get used to it

I know you getting used to it
