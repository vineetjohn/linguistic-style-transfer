Talk to me now, I'm older
Your friend told you 'cause I told her (puto el que lo lea)
Friday nights have been lonely
Change your plans and then phone me

We could go and get forties
Fuck going to that party
Oh really, your folks are away now
Alright, let's go, you convinced me

12: 51
Is the time my voice
Found the words I sought

Is it this stage I want
The world is shutting out for us
Oh we were tense for sure

But we was confident
Kiss me now that I'm older
I won't try to control you
Friday nights have been lonely
Take it slow but don't warn me
We'd go out and get forties
Then we'd go to some party
Oh really, your folks are away now
Alright I'm coming, I'll be right there
