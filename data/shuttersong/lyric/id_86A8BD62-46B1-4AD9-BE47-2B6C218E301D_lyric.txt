Got everything, I got everything

I cannot complain, I cannot

I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot

It's a lot, fuck that, nevermind what I got
Nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me for real
Came up, that's all me

Stay true, that's all me

No help, that's all me

All me for real
Money on my mind, you should think the same

J's on, pinky ring
Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
Oh! She want all the fame
I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me
I said, "Baby girl, fall in line, " ok
Made a million, off a dinner
Fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!" (Damn!)
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo

Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note

From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off

And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off

This that sauce, this that dressing

Givenchy, nigga God bless you

If having a bad bitch was a crime
I'd be arrested (True)

Got everything, I got everything

I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot

It's a lot, fuck that, nevermind what I got

Nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me

All me for real
Came up, that's all me

Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me for real
I touched down in '86

Knew I was a man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits

God damn
Ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with' us and we don't fuck with' y'all, it's no different over on
this side
God damn
Should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself, "You the motherfuckin' man, you don't need no help"
Cashin' checks and I'm bigging up my chest

Ya'll keep talking 'bout who next

But I'm about as big as it gets
I swear ya'll just wastin' ya'll breath
I'm the light skinned Keith Sweat
I'm a make it last forever
It's not your time 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I'm on the road box office sales

I'm getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot
It's a lot, fuck that, nevermind what I got
Nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me for real
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
HOE, SHUT THE fuck UP
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rest do
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything
Everything but gentle
But I still take my time
Man I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashioned
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit
Good sex, need to hit
Keep a bra on the floor
Year round like season tickets
I plead the fifth
Drink a fifth
Load the nine
Leave you split, in the half
Smoke a half, Need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 Problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me
And I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't workin'
Lil' bitch
Oh Me. Oh Me. Oh my. I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year, I'll do King of Diamonds, three more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that, they ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got your shine, I let you eat like that
I been taught never to loan somebody what you need right back
And I need that shit right back (no more free Randy)
I'm blessed than a motherfucker
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucker
Niggas gettin' nervous, clutchin' they chests like a motherfucker
Damn that's a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don't listen to ya
'Cause I don't like being lied to
And that ship won't sail
And that wind won't guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talkin' through the window
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then man
Now my niggas rich eno
