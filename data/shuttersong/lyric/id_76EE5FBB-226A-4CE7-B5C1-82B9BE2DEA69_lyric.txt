I know a place where I can go
When I'm low down
To your house, down to your house
I will go when I'm low

I know a face who I can show
My true colors
To your arms, into your arms
I will go when I'm low

'Cause total life forever
Will never be enough, no
'Cause total life forever
Will never be enough, no

I've seen it all [Incomprehensible]
To your house, down to your house
I will go when I'm low

They took it all and to the [Incomprehensible]
To your arms, into your arms
I will go when I'm low

'Cause total life forever
Will never be enough, no
'Cause total life forever
Will never be enough, no

Singularity is here to stay
So go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, down low
Let's take it slow

Singularity is here to stay for you and me
Go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, down low
Let's take life slow

Go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, down low
Let's take life slow

Go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, down low
Let's take life slow

I know a place where I can go
When I'm low down
To your house, down to your house
I will go when I'm low

I know a face who I can show
My true colors
To your arms, into your arms
I will go when I'm low

'Cause total life forever
Will never be enough, no
'Cause total life forever
Will never be enough, no
