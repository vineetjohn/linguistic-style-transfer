Get on your knees
And I thought you can leave it all in your mind (in it)
All in your mind (it is)
Crawl in the backseat old friend
It is really all in your mind (it is)
All in your mind

You look
So tired of living like a kite, kite, kite, kite
Look at all the trees in the light
They are growing all in your mind (it is)
All in your mind (it is)
Look at all the leaves in the fire
they are burning all in your mind (it is)

All in your mind
You look
So tired of living like a kite, kite, kite, kite

Get on your knees
And I thought you can leave it all in your mind (in it)
All in your mind (in it)
