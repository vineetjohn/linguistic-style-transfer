One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast
You played it back
Buttons on a coat
Light-hearted joke
No proof not much
But you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects
The chain on your neck
He says look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch
You felt enough

You can hear it in the silence, silence
You can feel it on the way home, way home
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love

Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word
And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight then you talk
One night he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says, you're my best friend
And you knew what it was, he is in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence
You can feel it on the way home, way home
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love

So it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, round and round
And he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown
You understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars

And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words
'Cause you can hear in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love

You are in love
You can hear it in the silence, silence
You can feel it on the way home, way home

You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love
You can hear it in the silence, silence
You can feel it on the way home, way home
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love
