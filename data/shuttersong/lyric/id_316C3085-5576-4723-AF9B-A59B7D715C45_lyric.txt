Throwing rocks at your window at midnight
You met me in your backyard that night
In the moonlight you looked just like an angel in disguise
My whole life seemed like a postcard

You were mine for a night
I was out of my mind
You were mine for a night
I don't know how to say goodbye

Making all our plans in the Santa Cruz sand that night
I thought I had you in the palm of my hand that night
Screaming at the top of my lungs 'til my chest felt tight
I told myself that I'm never gonna be alright

You had me wrapped around your finger
I'm wrapped around your finger
I'm wrapped around your finger
I'm wrapped around your finger
I'm wrapped around your finger
I'm wrapped around your finger
I'm wrapped around your finger
I'm wrapped around your finger

Wrapped around your finger
