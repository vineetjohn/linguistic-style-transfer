Lala, lalalala, lala, lalala
I like your smile
I like your vibe
I like your style
But that's not why I love you and I
I like the way, you're such a star
But that's not why I love you, hey
Do you feel?
Do you feel me? Do you feel what I feel too?
Do you need?
Do you need me?
Do you need me-e-e?

You're so beautiful
But that's not why I love you
I'm not sure you know
That the reason I love you is you
Being you, just you
Yeah, the reason I love you is all that we've been through
And that's why I love you

Lala, lalalala, lala, lalala

I like the way you misbehave
When we get wasted
But that's not why I love you

And how you keep your cool when I am complicated
But that's not why I love you, hey

Do you feel?
Do you feel me? Do you feel what I feel too?

Do you need?
Do you need me?
Do you need me-e-e?

You're so beautiful
But that's not why I love you
And I'm not sure you know
That the reason I love you is you
Being you, just you
Yeah, the reason I love you is all that we've been through
And that's why I love you
Yeaaah
Ohhhh, ohhhh

Even though we didn't make it through
I am always here for you, yea-a-ah
You're so beautiful
But that's not why I love you

I'm not sure you know
That the reason I love you is you
Being you, just you
Yeah, the reason I love you is all that we've been through
And that's why I love you
La la, la la la la (Oh ohhh)
La la, la la la la (That's why I love you)
La la, la la la la (Oh ohhh)
La la, la la la la (That's why I love you)
