Let's go to the beach, each
Let's go get away
They say, what they gonna say?
Have a drink, clink, found the bud light
Bad b-tches like me, is hard to come by

The patron on, let's go get it on
The zone on, yes, I'm in the zone
Is it two, three? Leave a good tip
I'mma blow off my money and don't give two sh-ts
I'm on the floor, floor
I love to dance
So give me more more, till I can't stand
Get on the floor, floor

Like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am
Starships were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Can't stop, 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time
Starships were meant to fly

Hands up, and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Can't stop
(we're higher than a motherf--ker)
(we're higher than a motherf--ker)
(we're higher than a motherf--ker)
Jump in my hoopty hoopty hoop
I own that
And I ain't paying my rent this month
I owe that

But f-ck who you want, and f-ck who you like
Dance our life, there's no end in sight
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
Now everybody let me hear you say ray ray ray
Now spend all your money 'cause they pay pay pay
And if you're a G, you a G, G, G!
My name is Onika, you can call me Nicki
Get on the floor, floor
Like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Can't stop, 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Can't stop
(we're higher than a motherf--ker)
(we're higher than a motherf--ker)
(we're higher than a motherf--ker)
Starships were meant to fly

Hands up, and touch the sky
Can't stop, 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time
Starships were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Can't stop
(we're higher than a motherf--ker)
