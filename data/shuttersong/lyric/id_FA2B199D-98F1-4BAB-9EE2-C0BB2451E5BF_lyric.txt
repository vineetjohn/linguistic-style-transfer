I've been everywhere, man
Looking for someone
Someone who can please me
Love me all night long
I've been everywhere, man
Looking for you, babe
Looking for you, babe
Searching for you, babe

Where have you been?
'Cause I never see you out
Are you hiding from me, yeah?
Somewhere in the crowd?...
Oh, woah

Where have you been?
All my life, all my life...
Where have you been, all my life?
Where have you been, all my life?
Where have you been, all my life?
Where have you been, all my life?
