I think you'll notice
When things become different
The good vibes in our lives
Won't feel so consistent
And, less becomes more
'Cos the weight is too heavy
I swim in the water that's breaking your levee
The way that you left me's all right, it's all right
If I argue the point then we yell and we fight
And I won't be home for the rest of the night
You might hate my words but you know that I'm right
You know that I'm right

This is your life, there's no way to run from it
The doubt in your brain, or the pain in your stomach
I only have the one complaint at the moment
Don't paint me black when I used to be golden.
The way that you left me's all right, it's all right
If I argue the point than we yell and we fight
And I won't be home for the rest of the night

You might hate my words but you know that I'm right
You know that I'm right
Don't paint me black, when I used to be golden.
