I don't care about your good intentions
I care more about your bad dreams
I want a love on a new dimension
You know I'm gonna be

Under the blossom tree
Come a little closer, won't you come a little closer to me?
You're my miracle
Under the blossom tree
Come a little closer, won't you come a little closer to me?
'Cause you're my miracle

In your black heart is where you'll find me
Cutting through the cracks of the concrete
In your black heart is where you'll find me waiting

You think love is a destination
Like a show on your TV
You'll cry to your generation
But don't you cry to me

Under the blossom tree
Come a little closer, won't you come a little closer to me?
You're my miracle
Under the blossom tree
Come a little closer, won't you come a little closer to me?
'Cause you're my miracle

In your black heart is where you'll find me
Cutting through the cracks of the concrete
In your black heart is where you'll find me waiting

In your black heart is where you'll find me
Cutting through the cracks of the concrete
In your black heart is where you'll find me waiting

Everything you ever wanted
Now it's happening, now it's happening
Everything you ever wanted
Now it's happening, under the blossom tree
Everything you ever wanted
Now it's happening, now it's happening
Everything you ever wanted
Now it's happening, under the blossom tree
