Well let me tell you a story
About a girl and a boy
He fell in love for his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken

And it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
But did you know that I loved you?
Or were you not aware?

You're the smile on my face
And I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy
I'm here to see you smile

I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while
Who's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love

But you can't fly unless you lets ya
You can't fly unless you lets ya, so fall
Well I can tell you're afraid of

What this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship
And that you don't wanna lose

Well I don't wanna lose it either
And I don't think I can stay
Sitting around while you're hurting babe, so take my hand
Well did you know you're an angel?

Who forgot how to fly
Did you know that it breaks my heart
Every time to see you cry
Cause I know that it pains if he's gone

Every time you don't know
On the shoulder you're crying
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song I'll have figured out
Who's gonna make you fall in love

I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you lets ya
You can't fly unless you lets ya, so fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you lets ya
You can't fly unless you lets ya, so fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you lets ya
You can't fly unless you lets ya, Let yourself...
fall
