Money, some people so poor all that they got is money
Oh and diamonds
Some people waste their life counting their thousands
I don't care what they're offering
How much gold they bring.

They can't afford what we got Brooklyn
Not even the king
They can't afford what we got
Not even the king

Ohhh castles, some people so lonely
What good is a castle?
Surrounded by people, but ain't got a friend
That's not on the payroll.
Ohh, I don't care what they bring
They can have everything.

They can't afford what we got
Not even the king
They can't afford what we got
Not even the king

All the king's horses and all the king's men
Came charging to get what we got.
They offered the crown and they offered the throne
I already got all that I want
All the king's horses and all the king's men
They came marching through
They offered world just to have what we got.

But I found the world in you
I found the world in you.
So darling listen
Your arms around me worth more than a kingdom
Yeah, believe that
The trust that we feel
The king's never felt that.
Yeah, this is the song we sing
We don't need anything
They can't afford this
This is priceless.
They can't afford what we've got
Not even the king
They can't afford what we got
Not even the king
