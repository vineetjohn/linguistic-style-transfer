I come home in the morning light
My mother says "When you gonna live your life right "
We're not the fortunate ones
Oh mother dear
And girls
They wanna have fu-un
Oh girls
Just wanna have fun
The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells "What you gonna do with your life "
Oh daddy dear
You know you're still number one
But girls
They wanna have fu-un
Oh girls just wanna have
That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls
They wanna have fu-un
Oh girls
Just wanna have fun
Girls
They want
Wanna have fun
Girls
Wanna have
Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun
Oh girls
They wanna have fu-un
Oh girls
Just wanna have
That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls
They wanna have fu-un
Oh girls
Just wanna have fun
Girls
They want
Wanna have fun
Girls
Wanna have
They just wanna

Girls just wanna have fu-un

When the working day is done
