Trough the milky way
In my spaceship
At the speed of light
I'm gonna make it
I know you've been expecting me
Turn on the camera's take another scene
We go like hands up people get with the show
We're taking over people lose control
And that's my DJ reaching my soul
And for the stars my people we never fall
Yes I'm an alien
When I'm touching the earth
Call me a spaceman
When I travel universe
Yes I'm an alien
When I'm touching the earth
Call me a spaceman
When I travel universe
Call me a spaceman
Call me a spaceman
Call me a spaceman
Call me a spaceman
Call me a spaceman
