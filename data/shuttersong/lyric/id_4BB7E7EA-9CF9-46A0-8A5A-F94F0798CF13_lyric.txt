I used to be so happy
But without here I feel so low
I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go
Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
It's very deep inside me but I feel there's something you should know

I'll never forget you
And you'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you till the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side till the day I die
Till the day I die
Till the day I die
Funny how we both ended happy but everything seems alright
I wonder what will happen
If we went back and put up a fight
Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
So thoughtful whisper do you think I'll ever take you off my mind
I'll never forget you

And you'll always be by my side

From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you till the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side till the day I die

Doing it, loving it
Everything that we do

And all along, I knew I had something special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know these things fall through
But I'm still tired and I can't hide my connection with you
Feeling it, loving it
Everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had something special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know these things fall through

But I'm still tired and I can't hide my connection with you
I'll never forget you
And you'll always be by my side

From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you till the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure

That I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side till the day I die
Till the day I die
Till the day I die
I'll never forget you
I'll never forget you
Till the day i die
