I've been counting down the days and the nights,
Since you last said that you loved me.
And its cold here in the shadows with no light,
Since you last said that you loved me.

I've been counting down the days and the nights,
Since you last said that you loved me.
And its cold here in the shadows with no light,
Since you last said that you loved me.

Time is like an enemy leaving lovers by the side,
The more you cling to love, the more you're gonna lose your mind.
All I feel is sadness now,
Taking over, taking over, taking over.
All I see is black clouds of doubt,
Taking over, taking over, taking over.

I've been counting down the days and the nights,
Since you last said that you loved me.
And its cold here in the shadows with no light,
Since you last said that you loved me.
