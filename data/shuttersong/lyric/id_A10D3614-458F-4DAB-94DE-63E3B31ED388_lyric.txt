I see you with her, and it crushes me inside
I guess I should stop thinkin' about you all the time
Maybe this is what I needed
Maybe this is a sign
Maybe I've been blind to reality, baby tell me...
Every little glance my way, everytime you wanted to hang
You seemed so interested, could you tell me?

Was it real or was it all in my head?
Was it real or was it all in my head?
She's so pretty, you two look so great
Time for me to move on now
It was probably just a silly crush anyway
But I just can't help but think.

That we. we could have had something
Have I really been blind to reality? Baby tell me...
Every little glance my way, every time you wanted to hang
You seemed so interested, could you tell me?
Was it real or was it all in my head?
Was it real or was it all in my head?
Was it real or was it fake
was it all a mistake?

Boy I just gotta know was it all in my head? All in my head
Did you ever feel the same?
Was my mind just playing games?
Boy I just gotta know was it all in my head? All in my head...
Every little glance my way, everytime you wanted to hang
You seemed so interested. could you tell me?
was it real or was it all in my head?
Was it real or was it all in my head?
