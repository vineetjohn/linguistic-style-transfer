Have you ever had a feeling you were being watched?
Footsteps behind you like a shadow when you walk?
Can’t tell if your mind is playing tricks or not?
Eh eh, eh eh no!

What I’m going through is now a rock in my brain.
Thinking bout like do I got any enemies?
Where I’ve been, what I did, what did I say?
Eh eh eh eh yeah!

Oh, comin’ to think of it,
I remember one chick,
That I was messing with,
While I was in Connecticut,
I met her after my show.
I took her back to my room.
The next day I had to go.
I never thought it would…

Get this deep!
Now I got this problem following me!
You better be careful, better be careful, better be careful!
Whose heart you’ll break,
You’re never knowing what she’ll do or say
Will send ’em over the edge so
Next time I’ll be careful!

I’m getting letters every other day addressed to me.
Saying dear Jason you and I were meant to be.
Tell me you feel the same or it will be the death of me.
Eh eh! It gets so worst now!
She reaching out to all my people, friends and family.
Got me so paranoid; I’m stackin’ up security.
It’s getting crazy here, it’s difficult for me to sleep.
Eh eh eh eh you know!

Now all I’m thinking is
How do I get out of this
I’m feeling kind of sick,
Damn this is some crazy shit
I met her after my show.
I took her back to my room.
The next day I had to go.
I never thought it would…

Get this deep!
Now I got this problem following me!
You better be careful, better be careful, better be careful!
Whose heart you’ll break,
You’re never knowing what she’ll do or say
Will send ’em over the edge so
Next time I’ll be careful!
Oh I’ll be careful, yeah yeah

This got so out of control.
I learned my lesson now so.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh be careful!
She’s holding, no won’t let go
She wants a piece of my soul.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh be careful!

I met her after my show.
I took her back to my room.
The next day I had to go.
I never thought it would…

Get this deep!
Now I got this problem following me!
You better be careful, better be careful, better be careful!
Whose heart you’ll break,
You’re never knowing what she’ll do or say
Will send ’em over the edge so

I never thought it would… get this deep!
Now I got this problem following me!
You better be careful, better be careful, better be careful!
Whose heart you’ll break,
You’re never knowing what she’ll do or say
Will send ’em over the edge so
Next time I’ll be careful!
