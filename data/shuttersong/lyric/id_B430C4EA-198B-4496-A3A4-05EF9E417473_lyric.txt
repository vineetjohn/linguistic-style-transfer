Yeah

Clearing off a table, In my mind was set for two
Acting like its nothing but Im feeling like a fool
And something's gotta break before another one brings me down
They bring me down

Next one had me trustin' every word I thought was true
How could you keep lying as she's lying next to you
And something's gotta break before another one brings me down
They bring me down

But what if there's something that I keep missing
What if there's someone that I can't lose
Nights when im crying, will he listen
Isn't there anybody?

What if there's someone that makes me happy
Someone that I already knew
What if? What if? What if that anybody?
Anybody's you? Any Anybody's You yeah

Chasing after trouble with the one I wouldn't keep
One of many wasting time falling at his feet
Feels good going up then it crushes hard when it brings me down
They bring me down (Yeah)

Im getting tired, tired
Of looking everywhere for somebody like you (like you)
Im just tired, tired and it brings me down
They bring me down

But what if there's something that I keep missing
What if there's someone that I can't lose
Nights when im crying, will he listen
Isn't there anybody?

What if there's someone that makes me happy
Someone that I already knew
What if? What if? What if that anybody?
Anybody's you? Any Anybody's You (yeah) Anybody's you?

Someone to listen, Someone to make me happy
Someone who loves me. What if that anybody's you
Someone to listen, Someone to make me happy
Someone who loves me. What if that anybody is you

What if there's something that I keep missing
What if there's someone that I can't lose
Nights when im crying, will he listen
Isn't there anybody?
What if there's someone that makes me happy
Someone that I already knew
What if? What if? What if that anybody?
Oh Anybody's you yeah
