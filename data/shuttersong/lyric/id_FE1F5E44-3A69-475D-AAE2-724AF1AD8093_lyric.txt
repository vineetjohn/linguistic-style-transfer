Me, I'm ridin' clean
smokin' good, can barely keep my eyes open
Listenin' to my favorite song, leanin' in my car chokin'
Tell my dawg to 'hit this weed,' feel like I'm finna pass out
Thought I had exclusive trees, until he pulled his bag out
Half out, a half ounce,
some shit I never seen in life
Said that once he bagged it, smelled so bad, he had to bag it twice
I told him 'roll that shit up', this weed I had to light
These clowns somewhere in the clouds, me I'mma satellite
I roll em' very nice
With smoke comin' out the end like a muffler, got game from the hustler
Never said I'm gon' quit, can't get enough of good weed in my lungs
Plus I'm sharin' I ain't cuffin'
My eyes wide shut, I'm just starin' sayin' nothin'
I flick ashes, got big stashes
So I don't need a dime, I got big baggage bitch!
Yeah, I blow it by the zip
Anywhere I go, it's on the road, on every trip
Ask my nene, love her grandson, but she know that I'mma trip
Got my habit from this?, smokin' roaches gettin' lit
Now I feel my blunt with so much weed, they say 'that all ain't gon' fit'
On some highly grown shit, with a hollywood bitch
Got the sweetest purple kush and a precisely rolled spliff
Hot as . . .? Pole's Bic
On the way to see Marcella's
, girl I'm in another world and shit, he got another twirl
For those who don't know, he got that roll game
And I ain't gon' lie, he the reason why I got my roll game
Feel like I'm Soul Plane
I smoke the whole thing
Pound or O.Z
Kush fiend, Purple, Master, OG
(Yeah, that's a little bit of kush talk for yall' niggas who might not comprehend)
And every nigga that grow weed should know me
my swishers so sweet bitch
