You, you would always see the signs
The echoes in my head they rhyme
I feel we never went at all
Tomorrow is another day
I don't know when I'll feel anymore
Feeling all these things before
And all that I would do

You, you would always see the signs
The echoes in my head they rhyme
I felt they never went home at all
Tomorrow is another day that we need
I don't know where I'll be searching for the things I've seen
And I'm a feeling all this things before I go through
All that I would do I do for you

Round about a quarter past
We rustle up all inside
Of everyone and everything
That didn't owe us too well
And in our hearts
The matter is they know the reason too well
I heard the rain it never came
When we oh oh oh

And I'd better get in control of this heavy vehicle
Or else I'll go and then I'll go and explode
To the place that I adore
Seen places on the shore
Where've you been and where no sun is a sin

Been packing all night long to get ready for some fun
And you go and you go evermore
I hate feeling in control
I want someone else's role
But I'm here and I'll do anything

Together this is a heart attack
I'm gonna get off in a sec
But for now I'm having way too much fun
To the place that I adore
Seen places on the shore
Where did you go and where did you go everyone?
Been packing all night long to get ready for some fun
And you go and you go evermore
I hate feeling in control
I want someone else's role
But I'm here and I'll do anything
