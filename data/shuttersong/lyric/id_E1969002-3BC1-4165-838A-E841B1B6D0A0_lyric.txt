Find Tomorrow (Ocarina) (feat  Wolfpack & Katy B) (Radio Edit) - Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike
Take me to a place where time is frozen
You don't have to close your eyes to dream
You can find escape inside this moment
And I will follow
I will follow
I believe our love can take us higher
Please don't ever bring me back to earth
I know I'm never lost
When you are near me
We'll find tomorrow
Find tomorrow
Don't you cry
Take your time
Let the world wait forever
Morning light will be our guide
As long as we stay together
We can find tomorrow
We can find tomorrow-ow-ow-ow
We can find tomorrow
We can find tomorrow-ow-ow-ow
We can find tomorrow
