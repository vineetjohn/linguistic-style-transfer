Oh, flew in from Miami Beach B.O.A.C.

Didn't get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R. (Yeah)
Been away so long I hardly knew the place

Gee it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.
Back in the U.S.
Back in the U.S.S.R.
Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out

They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my mind
Aw come on!

Ho yeah!
Ho yeah!
Ho ho yeah!
Yeah yeah!
Yeah I'm back in the U.S.S.R.

You don't know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.
Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out

They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my mind
Oh, show me around your snow-peaked mountains way down south

Take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear your balalaika's ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.
Hey you don't know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.
Oh let me tell you, honey
Hey, I'm back!

Yes, I'm free!
Yeah, back in the U.S.S.R.
