I love it when they try to get intimate
Even though they know I really ain't into it
(You're not into it?)
I'm not into it
I already know the game and I've been through it

See I buy my own bags, my boots, my jeans
Wear LaRok with my Rebel Yell underneath
You wanna step to me?
Said you got a long way 2 go
Rock wit me now

You claim that you're so hot
And you say you got skills in the bedroom
You try to flirt when you're so not
Had a chance you still never come through

You say you wanna come see me
'Cause you know your girlfriend wanna be me
I'ma tell you why you can't
Said you got a long way 2 go
Say you wanna love me?

Wanna love me? Wanna touch me?
Think twice 'cause you got a long way 2 go
Don't know how to act, better fall back
It's like that 'cause you got a long way 2 go

It's not that deep, take it easy
You wanna please me? Got a long way 2 go
I'ma bad girl, you wanna get close?
Ease up 'cause you got a long way

I love it when they try to get scandalous
Even though they know they really can't handle it
(They can't handle it?)
They can't handle it
Try and take me out to dinner, I'll cancel it

If you really wanna know me first of all
You should never try to get too personal
'Cause I'm in it when I say
That you got a long way 2 go

You claim that you're so hot
And you say you got skills in the bedroom
You try to flirt when you're so not
Had a chance you still never come through

You say you wanna come see me
'Cause you know your girlfriend wanna be me
I'ma tell you why you can't
Said you got a long way 2 go
Say you wanna love me?

Wanna love me? Wanna touch me?
Think twice 'cause you got a long way 2 go
Don't know how to act, better fall back
It's like that 'cause you got a long way 2 go

It's not that deep, take it easy
You wanna please me? Got a long way 2 go
I'ma bad girl, you wanna get close?
Ease up 'cause you got a long way
