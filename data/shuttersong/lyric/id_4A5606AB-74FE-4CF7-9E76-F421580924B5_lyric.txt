I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changing your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me

I try with you
Yeah
There's more to life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose

And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we should have just did things my way

Instead of the other way
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose

And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
I tried with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
