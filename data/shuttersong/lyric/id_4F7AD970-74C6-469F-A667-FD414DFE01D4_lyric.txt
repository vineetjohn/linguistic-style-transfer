Where did they go?
Nights like this don't happen anymore

I need to know
Is it me? and did I lose control?
Lonely over seas
Lonely memories

Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go
Baby, they don't know
What we had before
What it felt before our eyes
Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby

Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down
It's been difficult
I'm just happy there's no fights no more

But it's nights like this that I never ever missed you more
If there's a reason why this happens for
Lonely over seas
Lonely memories

Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go
Baby, they don't know
What we had before
What it felt before our eyes
Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby

Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down
Lonely over seas
Lonely memories

Wish I had the key to your heart

People come and go
Baby, they don't know
What we had before
What it felt before our eyes
Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down
