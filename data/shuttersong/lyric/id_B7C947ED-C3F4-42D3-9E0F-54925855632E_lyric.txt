Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire
I'm watching her dance, dress is catching the light
In her eyes there's no lies, no lies
There's no question, she's not in a disguise

With no way out and a long way down
Everybody needs someone around
But I can't hold you too close now
Through the wire, through the wire

What a feeling to be right here beside you now
Holding you in my arms
When the air ran out and we both started running wild
The sky fell down

But you've got stars, they're in your eyes
And I've got something missing tonight
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow
I wish I could be there now

Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire
I'm watching you like this, imagining you're mine
It's too late, it's too late, am I too late?
Tell me now, am I running out of time?

With no way out and a long way down
Everybody needs someone around
But I can't hold you too close now
Through the wire, through the wire

What a feeling to be right here beside you now
Holding you in my arms
When the air ran out and we both started running wild
The sky fell down

But you've got stars, they're in your eyes
And I've got something missing tonight
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow
I wish I could be there now

Whatever chains are holding you back
Holding you back, don't let 'em tie you down
Whatever chain are holding you back
Holding you back, tell me you believe in that

What a feeling to be right here beside you now
Holding you in my arms
When the air ran out and we both started running wild
The sky fell down

But you've got stars, they're in your eyes
And I've got something missing tonight
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow
I wish I could be there now
I wish I could be there now
