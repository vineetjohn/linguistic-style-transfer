Now it falls all around me
Did I think I could run away?
Now it's coming to find me
This world that I deserve
Now it burns across this shadow
I lift my eyes to fire

Under a falling sky
Hopeless, there's nowhere to hide
The terror is real this time
Under a falling sky
I'm under, I'm under
A falling sky

There you are, so far away
Did you think I was fighting you?
I only wanted to carry you
So far away from here
The nightmare bleeds
The poison seeps
I hear you calling
You're screaming, screaming

Under a falling sky
Hopeless, there's nowhere to hide
The terror is real this time
Under a falling sky
I'm under, I'm under
A falling sky

Under a falling sky
The terror is real this time
It's over now, it's over
NOW!
The terror is real!

I'm under, I'm under
A falling sky

Under a falling sky
I'm falling, I'm falling
The terror is real this time
I'm falling, I'm falling
Under a falling sky
I'm falling, I'm falling
I'm under...
