One day, when I came home at lunchtime
I heard a funny noise.
Went out to the back yard to find out
If it was one of those rowdy boys.
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a Flux Capacitor.

He told me he built a time machine.
Like one in a film I've seen
Yeah... he said...

I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived under water.
And your great, great, great, grand daughter
Is doing fine (doing fine).

He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything.
Boy bands, and another one and another one... (and another one!)

And girls there with brown hair like Star Wars
They float above the floor.
We drove around in a time machine

Like the one in the film I've seen...
Yeah...
He said, I've been to the year 3000.
Not much has changed but they lived under water

And your great, great, great, grand daughter
Is doing fine (doing fine).
I took a trip to the year 3000.
This song had gone multi-platinum.
Everybody bought our 7th album.

It had outsold Kelly Clarkson.
I took a trip to the year 3000.

Everybody bought our 7th album, (7th album, 7th album)

Not much has changed but they lived under water.(woow yeahee!)
And your great, great, great, grand, daughter, (gand, grand daughter)
Is doing fine (doing fine, doing fine)
He said, I've been to the year 3000.
Not much has changed (not much) but they lived under water. (woow yeahee!)
And your great great great grand daughter
Is doing fine (doing fine).
