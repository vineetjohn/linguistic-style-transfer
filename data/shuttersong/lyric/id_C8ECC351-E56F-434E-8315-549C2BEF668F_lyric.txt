You say that I'm too complicated.
Hung up and miseducated.
Well I say 9 to 5 is overrated,
and we all fall down.

I can't sleep cause my mind keeps racing.
And my chest hurts cause my heart keeps breaking.
I'm so numb and I can't stop shaking,
and we all fall down.

Frustration, desperation.
You say you need some kinda medication.
Situation, no motivation.
Desperation, permanent vacation.

And I'm doing fine,
and I know I'm out of line.
So lets sing this one more time.
It goes,
destination, permanent vacation.

Na na na na na na na na

Voices coming through the speaker.
And they can't make me a believer.
I know that I'm an underachiever,
and we're all so proud.

Watch out, I think we're going under.
Cause right now, we're just another number.
Get out, the system's overcrowded
and we're all so proud.

Frustration, desperation.
They say I need some kinda medication.
Situation, no motivation.
Destination, permanent vacation.

And I'm doing fine,
and I know I'm out of line.
So I'll sing this one more time.
It goes,
destination, permanent vacation.

And I'm doing fine,
and I know I'm out of line.
So I'll sing this one more time.
It goes,
destination, permanent vacation.

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na

Congratulations, your imitations.
I can't get over the radio stations.
Corperations, calculations.
We're the voice of the new generation.

And I'm doing fine,
and I know I'm out of line.
So I'll sing this one more time.
It goes,
destination, permanent vacation.

And I'm doing fine,
and I know I'm out of line.
So I'll sing this one more time.
It goes,
destination, permanent vacation.

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na

Destination, permanent vacation.
