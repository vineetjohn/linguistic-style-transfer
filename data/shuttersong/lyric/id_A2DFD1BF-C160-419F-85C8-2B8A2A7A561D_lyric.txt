My disposition permeates
The room when I walk in the place
I'm sorry!
By calculation I'm way too much
Pretentiously I bitch a bunch
But you bought it!
I can't exceed my reputation
A small town girl with compensation
Explorin' all my possibilities
Well don't you know I'll blaze a trail
But hell
You can come with me

What doesn't kill you
Only makes you blonder
My heels and my hotel
They just got taller
Somethin' bout platinum irrefutably
Looks as good on records
As it does on me

Historically real men prefer
The Marilyns with curls and curves
and I've got it!
Genetically or chemically
As long as it contains some bleach
I want it!

You don't need to be a fighter
Honey, just go one shade lighter
You'll acquire everything you want
When your roots grow out
And things go South
Hey, go back to the salon!

What doesn't kill you
Only makes you blonder
My heels and my hotel
They just got taller
Somethin' bout platinum irrefutably
Looks as good on records as it does on me

Hey! What doesn't kill you
Only makes you blonder
In fact, my heels and my hotel
They just got taller
Somethin' bout platinum irrefutably
Looks as good on records as it does on me
Somethin' bout platinum irrefutably
Looks as good on records as it does on me
Platinum
Platinum
Somethin' bout platinum
