Young love, close the chapter, there's no ever after
Fell fast, ended faster, yeah
Late night conversations, let to complications
Now my heart is in my hands
Cause you walked out and left me stranded
Nothing left but picture frames

And I just keep on asking myself
How'd we drift so far away from where we left off yesterday?
I'm lonely like a castaway

Heartbreak that I can't escape, a sinking ship I'll never save
I'm lonely like a castaway
All your screaming whispers, slip right through my fingers
But these memories linger on
Eyes closed, all I see is good times disappearing
And I'm trying to hold on

Cause you walked out and left me stranded
Nothing left but picture frames
I just keep on asking myself
How'd we drift so far away from where we left off yesterday?
I'm lonely like a castaway

Heartbreak that I can't escape, a sinking ship I'll never save
I'm lonely like a castaway
Castaway, castaway

How'd we drift so far away from where we left off yesterday?
I'm lonely like a castaway
How'd we drift so far away from where we left off yesterday?
I'm lonely like a castaway
Heartbreak that I can't escape, a sinking ship I'll never save
I'm lonely like a castaway
Castaway
Castaway
