Hey, dad, look at me
Think back and talk to me
Did I grow up according to plan?
And do you think I'm wasting my time doing things I want to do?
But it hurts when you disapprove all along

And now I try hard to make it
I just want to make you proud
I'm never gonna be good enough for you
Can't pretend that I'm all right
And you can't change me

'Cause we lost it all
Nothing lasts forever
I'm sorry, I can't be perfect
Now it's just too late
And we can't go back
I'm sorry, I can't be perfect

I try not to think
About the pain I feel inside
Did you know you used to be my hero?
All the days you spent with me
Now seem so far away
And it feels like you don't care anymore

And now I try hard to make it
I just want to make you proud
I'm never gonna be good enough for you
I can't stand another fight
And nothing's alright

'Cause we lost it all
And nothing lasts forever
I'm sorry, I can't be perfect
Now it's just too late
And we can't go back
I'm sorry, I can't be perfect

Nothing's gonna change the things that you said
And nothing's gonna make this right again
Please, don't turn your back
I can't believe it's hard just to talk to you
But you don't understand (you don't understand...)

'Cause we lost it all
And nothing lasts forever
I'm sorry, I can't be perfect
Now it's just too late
And we can't go back
I'm sorry, I can't be perfect

'Cause we lost it all
And nothing lasts forever
I'm sorry, I can't be perfect
Now it's just too late
And we can't go back
I'm sorry, I can't be perfect
