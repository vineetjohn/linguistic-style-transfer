She
Ties her hair up, tight
Puts her armor on
When she steps outside
She
Is in black and white
And the color's gone
But it's in her eyes
Time and time again we're going back to the start
And I'm trying, try again to bring some light to the dark
You know every day's a battle and it tears her apart
And I don't know why
And I'm picking up the pieces when we fall to the feet
We confide in other demons, though she'll never be free
We could hide it in the shadows, though it's hard to believe
And I don't know why

Love, don't ever change the way you are
You light the sky just like a star
I don't care what you say
You're beautiful to me
Ohh

She
She never gets it right
And it feels like rain on a perfect night
And I
I'd be a hand to hold
You can push me hard, but I won't let go
Time and time again we're going back to the start
And I'm trying, try again to bring some light to the dark
You know every day's a battle and it tears her apart
But, don't you cry

My love don't ever change the way you are
You light the sky just like a star
I don't care what you say
You're beautiful to me

Love, I'll be your ordinary goal
You're so amazing, don't you know?
I don't care what you say
You're beautiful to me
Ohh

The light breaks through your hair and
They're all stopping and staring
I'd go anywhere
Oh, why can't you just see that?
I'm crazy about you
I can't live without you
You don't see it
But you're beautiful to me

Love, don't ever change the way you are
You light the sky just like a star
I don't care what you say
You're beautiful
Ohh

Love, don't ever change the way you are
You light the sky just like a star
I don't care what you say
You're beautiful to me
Come'on
Love, I'll be your ordinary goal
You're so amazing, don't you know?
I don't care what you say
You're beautiful to me
You're beautiful to me
