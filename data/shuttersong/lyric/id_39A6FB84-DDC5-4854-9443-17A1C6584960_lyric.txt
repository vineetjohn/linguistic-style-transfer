Is That Your Life Lyrics
Tricky
Pick up my weed and bring it come
Take what you need
Bring, bring a gun
What you need, we can serve
Want that money, we reserve
We want that car, we want that house
Informer boy, shut your mouth
I lost my boy, I lost my friend
Got locked down, give him ten
My brothers gone, back in again
My cousins gone and shot my friend
Pick up my weed and bring it come
Take what you need
Bring bring a gun

Is that your, is that your
Is that your life
Think before, think before
You got one life
Easy boy, I cut your throat
Smoke that weed, snort the coke
I got caught up, I caught a case
You can't hide, you're not safe
I drive my Porsche, I can't slow down
What's that sound, up on the town
Bring the keys make sure you're armed
Here's the code, switch the alarm
Tie that guy, don't let him breath
On the ground, you can't leave

Pick up my weed and bring it come
Take what you need
Bring, bring a gun

Is that your, is that your
Is that your life
Think before, think before
You got one life
Take what I want, take what I need
Best believe, I feed my greed
Better to take kerosene (?)
You take a break, you drink champagne
You touch a bird, you keep your word (?)
You touch a bird, you keep your word (?)

Is that your, is that your
Is that your life
Think before, think before
You got one life
