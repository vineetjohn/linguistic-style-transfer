Would you bleed for me?
Lick it off my lips like you needed me?
Would you sit me on a couch with your fingers in my mouth?
You look so cool when you're reading me
Let's cause a little trouble
Oh, you make me feel so weak
I bet you kiss your knuckles
Right before they touch my cheek
But I've got my mind made up this time
'Cuz there's a menace in my bed
Can you see his silhouette? x3
And I've got my mind made up this time
Go on and light a cigarette
Set a fire in my head
Set a fire in my head, tonight
Would you lie for me?
Cross your sorry heart and hope to die for me?
Would you pin me to a wall?
Would you beg or would you crawl?
Stick a needle in your hungry eyes for me?
Let's cause a little trouble
Oh, you make me feel so weak
I bet you kiss your knuckles
Right before they touch my cheek
But I've got my mind made up this time
'Cuz there's a menace in my bed
Can you see his silhouette? x3
And I've got my mind made up this time
Go on and light a cigarette
Set a fire in my head
Set a fire in my head, tonight
Don't forget me, don't forget me
I wouldn't leave you if you'd let me
Mmmm, when you met me, when you met me
You told me you were gonna get me
Don't forget me, don't forget me
I wouldn't leave you if you'd
And I've got my mind made up this time
'Cuz there's a menace in my bed
Can you see his silhouette? x3
And I've got my mind made up this time
Go on and light a cigarette
Set a fire in my head
Set a fire in my head, tonight, tonight, tonight
Set a fire in my head, tonight
