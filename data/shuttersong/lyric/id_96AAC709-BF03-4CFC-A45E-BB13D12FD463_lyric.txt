Those eyes you bought have gone to my head
But they won't take you to my bed
You talk a good game
But girl you've been played
Look at this shade you choose to play
The towns talk keeps me up to date
We will never be the same

This is a war
This is a heart
These are the strings you'll pull
These are the stakes
They have been raised,
It's your call.
Too much has changed,
I hate this place
But I don't want to leave it this way

So lets get it straight,
Without a thought I will take
I'll take it all away.
That's the price you pay for having luck in the first place.
Call it what you want
I've spent too long under your thumb
And now the clouds haves had there say.

I'll make a bet that says we don't leave this place as friends.
Are you comfortable,
Are you comfortable with this?
You play the lady
I'll play the gent
We will call it time well spent.
But I've been lying and you're gonna hate me for this.

This is the storm,
so let it pour and take over your shores.
Here comes the rain,
I'll have my day it's so sore
Let it be heard
Lessons to learn
And it will never heart like this agian.


Take off your colours
Who are you wearing them for?
Tick off your lovers,
All respect was left at the door.
I had front row seats to you on your knees,
It was everything I hoped it be

I'll make a bet that says we don't leave this place as friends.
Are you comfortable
'Cause you're gonna hate me for this.

I'll make a bet that says we don't leave this place as friends.
Are you comfortable,
Are you comfortable with this?
You play the lady
I'll play the gent
We will call it time well spent.
But I've been lying and you're gonna hate me for this.
