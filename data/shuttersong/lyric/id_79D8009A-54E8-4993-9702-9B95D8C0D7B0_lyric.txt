If your lips are moving, if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving then you're ly-ly-lying, baby
If your lips are moving, if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving then you're ly-ly-lying, baby

Boy, look at me in my face
Tell me that you're not just about this bass
You really think I could be replaced?!
Nah, I come from outer space
And I'm a classy girl, I'ma hold it up
You're full of something, but it ain't love
What we got, straight overdue
Go find somebody new
You can buy me diamond earrings
and deny-ny-ny, ny-ny-ny, deny-ny
but I smell her on your collar so goodbye-bye-bye, bye-bye-bye

I know you lie 'cause your lips are moving
Tell me, do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young, but I ain't stupid
Talking 'round in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass, you gave me sweet talk
Saying now I'm your number one
But I know you lie 'cause your lips are moving
Baby, don't you know, I'm done!

If your lips are moving, if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving then you're ly-ly-lying, baby
If your lips are moving, if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving then you're ly-ly-lying, baby

Hey baby don't you bring them tears
'Cause it's too late, too late baby oooh uh
You only love me when you're here
You're so two-faced, two-faced babe
You can buy me diamond earrings
and deny-ny-ny, ny-ny-ny, deny-ny (yes, you can baby)
but I smell her on your collar so goodbye-bye-bye, bye-bye-bye

I know you lie 'cause your lips are moving
Tell me, do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young, but I ain't stupid
Talking 'round in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass, you gave me sweet talk
Saying now I'm your number one
But I know you lie 'cause your lips are moving
Baby, don't you know, I'm done!

Come on, say!
If your lips are moving, if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving then you're ly-ly-lying, baby
If your lips are moving, if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving then you're ly-ly-lying, baby
(Alright now, I wanna hear y'all singing with me)

I know you lie 'cause your lips are moving
Tell me, do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young (young!), but I ain't stupid (stupid!)
Talking 'round in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass, you gave me sweet talk
Saying now I'm your number one
But I know you lie 'cause your lips are moving
Baby, don't you know, I'm done!
