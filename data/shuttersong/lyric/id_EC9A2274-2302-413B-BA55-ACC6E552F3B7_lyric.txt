Love On Top - Beyonc¨¦
Bring the beat in  
Honey' honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane 
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me I just melt away
Now everybody asks me why
I'm smiling out from ear to ear (They say love hurts)
But I know (It's gonna take the real work)' Ooo   
Nothing's perfect' but it's worth it
After fighting through my fears
And finally you put me first
Baby it's you  
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only one I see
Come on baby it's you  
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you make everything stop
Finally you put my love on top  
Ooo  Come on Baby  
You put my love on top' top' top' top' top
You put my love on top
Ooo Ooo  Come on baby  
You put my love on top' top' top' top' top
My love on top' My love on top  
Come on Baby
I can feel the wind whipping past my face
As we dance the night away
Boy your lips taste like a night of champagne
As I kiss you again' and again' and again and again
Now everybody asks me why
I'm smiling out from ear to ear (They say love hurts)
But I know (It's gonna take the real work)' Ooo   
Nothing's perfect' but it's worth it
After fighting through my fears
And finally you put me first
Baby it's you  
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only one I see
Come on baby it's you  
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you make everything stop
Finally you put my love on top  
Ooo  Baby  
You put my love on top' top' top' top' top
You put my love on top  
Ooo Ooo  Come on baby  
You put my love on top' top' top' top' top
My love on top' My love on top  
Baby it's you
