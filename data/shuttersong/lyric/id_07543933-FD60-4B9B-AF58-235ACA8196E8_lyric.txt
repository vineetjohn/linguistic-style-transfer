I believe [4x]
No matter what you do
I believe [4x]
It will all come back to you

Stand up and find your own way
Or sit down and wait for your turn
Follow you vision blindly
Or just become the vision of someone

Remove the shackles right now
You never really fit into ‘em at all
Or keeping running with that metal 
On your feet until you fall

Everything that you say
Become the things that you do
Remember what you put out there is building you
Remember everything is everything

I believe [4x]
No matter what you do
I believe [4x]
It will all come back to you

I kinda been struggling
The fire on my tongue’s been challenging 
But even the wise ones be stumbling
So pick your heart up here and walk tall

Bright- eyed deliverance 
Everything you say’s significant
So speak your truth, be spirited
You’re beautiful and bold, so carry one

Everything that you say
Become the things that you do
Remember what you put out there is building you
Remember everything is everything

Everything is everything, every single day
Remember this in everything you do everything you say
In everything you eat and all the people that you meet
There is life, there is light, that’s reflected back on me

I believe [4x]
No matter what you do
I believe [4x]
It will all come back to you

Turn your speakers down
And listen to the silence down below
That’s the messenger 
And that’s the only one that really knows

Turn my music down
‘Cause it’s your turn now
Well it’s your turn now
Oh it’s you turn right now

Remember all that you say
It becomes all that you do
Everything that you put out there is building you up
Or it’s breaking you down to the ground
Well it’s your choice now
Yeah it’s your voice now
It’s that same sound

Everything that you say
Become the things that you do
Remember what you put out there is building you
Remember everything is everything
