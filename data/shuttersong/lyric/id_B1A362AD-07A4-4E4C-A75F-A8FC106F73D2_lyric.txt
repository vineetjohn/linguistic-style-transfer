"Charlie Brown"

Wooh, ooh ooh ooh

Stole a key,
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet,
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free,
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene,
Saw the lights go down and standing in front of me.

Wooh, ooh ooh ooh

In my scarecrow dreams,
When they smash my heart into smithereens,
Be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete.
Be a cartoon heart,
Light a fire, a fire, a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart.
We'll run wild,
We'll be glowing in the dark.

Wooh, ooh ooh ooh

We'll be glowing in the dark.

All the boys, all the girls,
All that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls,
All the madness that occurs.
All the highs, all the lows,
As the room a-spinning goes
We'll run riot,
We'll be glowing in the dark.

Wooh, ooh ooh ooh

So we'll soar luminous and wired
We'll be glowing in the dark.
