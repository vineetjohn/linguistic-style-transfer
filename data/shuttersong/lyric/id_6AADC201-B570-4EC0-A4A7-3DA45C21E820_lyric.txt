Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day
you gave it away

This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Once bitten and twice shied
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me
Well, it's been a year
it doesn't surprise me
Merry Christmas

I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying
'I love you', I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been

But if you kiss me now
I know you'd fool me again
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart

But the very next day
you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day
you gave it away

This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you

and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart

A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year
Maybe this year

I'll give it to someone special
Cause last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day
you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day
you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
And last Christmas
And this year
It won't be anything
like, anything like
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day
you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
