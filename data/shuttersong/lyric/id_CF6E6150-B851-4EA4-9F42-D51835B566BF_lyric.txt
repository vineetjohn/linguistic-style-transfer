Blonde hair blowin' in the summer wind
A blue-eyed girl playing in the sand
I'd been on a trail for a little while

But that was the night that she broke down and held my hand
The teenage rush, she said, 'maybe I'll just runaway, we got time'
Well that ain't much...
We can't wait 'til tomorrow
You gotta know that this is real, baby why you wanna fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose, oh!

We got engaged on a Friday night
I swore on the head of our unborn child that I could take care of the three of us
But I got the tendency to slip when the nights get wild.
It's in my blood
She says she might just runaway somewhere else, some place good
We can't wait 'til tomorrow
You gotta know that this is real, baby why you wanna fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose

Let's take a chance baby we can't lose
Mean we're all just runaways
I knew that when I met you, I'm not gonna let you runaway
I knew that when I held you, I wasn't lettin' go

We used to look at the stars and confess our dreams
Hold each other to the morning light
We used to laugh, now we only fight
Baby are you lonesome now?

At night I come home after they go to sleep
Like a stumbling ghost, I haunt these halls
There's a picture of us on our wedding day
I recognize the girl but I can't settle in these walls

We can't wait 'til tomorrow
No we're caught up in the appeal, baby why you wanna hide it?
It's the last thing on my mind
(Why you wanna hide it?)
I turn the engine over and my body just comes alive and we all just runaway
I knew that when I met you, I'm not gonna let you runaway
I knew that when I held you, I wasn't lettin go, no no no!
(No no no!)
(And we're all just runaways)
Yeah runaway
(And we're all just runaways)
Yeah
