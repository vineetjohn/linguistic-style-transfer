This is Gospel for the fallen ones
Locked away in permanent slumber
Assembling their philosophies
From pieces of broken memories

Oh Woah-oh
(This is the beat of my heart This is the beat of my heart)
Oh Woah-oh
(This is the beat of my heart This is the beat of my heart)

The gnashing teeth and criminal tounges
Conspire against the odds
But they haven't seen the best of us yet

If you love me let me go
If you love me let me go
Cause these words are knives that often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
And truth be told I never was yours
The fear, the fear of falling apart

(This is the beat of my heart This is the beat of my heart)
(This is the beat of my heart This is the beat of my heart)

This is Gospel for the vagabonds
Ne'er-do-wells and insufferable bastards
Confessing their apostasies
Led away by imperfect impostors

Oh Woah-oh
(This is the beat of my heart This is the beat of my heart)
Oh Woah-oh
(This is the beat of my heart This is the beat of my heart)

Don't try to sleep through the end of the world
And bury me alive
Cause I won't give up without a fight

If you love me let me go
If you love me let me go
Cause these words are knives that often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
And truth be told I never was yours
The fear, the fear of falling apart
The fear of falling apart
The fear, the fear of falling apart
(This is the beat of my heart This is the beat of my heart)
The fear of falling apart
(This is the beat of my heart This is the beat of my heart)
The fear of falling apart
(This is the beat of my heart This is the beat of my heart)
The fear of falling apart
(This is the beat of my heart This is the beat of my heart)
The fear of falling apart
