Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

Find light in the beautiful sea
I choose to be happy
You and I, you and I
We're like diamonds in the sky

You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

I knew that we'd become one right away
A right away
At first sight I left the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your, eyes

So shine bright, tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond

We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond

We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel de warmth we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky

You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky
