[Reba:]
LA's a fast horse daddy
Everybody rides
I'm sorry I haven't called home lately
Out here time flies
I met a boy a few weeks back
He plays in a band
He's a whole lot like you daddy you're gonna like him
He's a good man
At times lonley sneaks up on me
But I'm getting by
Yeah I know what you've always told me
Cow girls don't cry

[Chorus:]
But does the wind still blow in oklahoma
Out here the hollywood stars sure shine bright
It's such a long way from home here in California
Missin you and that blue wide open sky

[Ronnie:]
Out here it's all freeway fast cars
Cold concrete
You won't believe all the crazy people
Bally girls sun sets free
I met a girl you're gonna like her mama
She has your hair
Red as the telecross sunset
Seems like an angel I swear
I can't say I don't get lonsome
But I'm alright
Cow boys kinda go with homesick
Like blue moons and whipperwill nights

[Chorus]
