Find yourself in a situation
Can't talk your way out of
Stimulate the conversation
How do you rise above
You try to tell some one
But you can't describe it

We'll start a demonstration
Or we'll create a scene
Make noise from our frustration
Newspapers, magazines
We'll turn them on their heads
You can't deny it

For once
We'll do what comes naturally
We'll approach it casually
With no apology

For once
We can have the final say
Goodbye to yesterday
'Cause we know we're here to stay

Pop, pop, pop goes the world
New sensation
Pop, pop, pop goes the world
New creation

Give every generation
A different set of rules
We'll start with TV stations
The radios and schools
Just try to have some fun
And don't get caught
We'll capture their attention
We'll make them quite aware
Of all of our intentions
We'll make 'em stop and stare
They'll take a second look
On second thought

For once
We'll do what come naturally
We'll approach it casually
With no apology

For once
We can have the final say
Goodbye to yesterday
'Cause they know we're here to stay

Pop, pop, pop goes the world
New salvation
Pop, pop, pop goes the world
New translation
Pop, pop, pop goes the world
New elation
Pop, pop, pop goes the world
New sensation
