Yes, I can see her
Cause every girl in here wanna be her
Oh she's a diva
I feel the same and I wanna meet her

They say she low down
It's just a rumor and I don't believe 'em
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town

She's nothing like a girl you've ever seen before
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood hoe
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful
The way that booty movin' I can't take no more

Had to stop what I'm doin' so I can pull up close
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful
Damn girl
Damn who's a sexy bitch

Damn who's a sexy bitch
Damn girl
Damn who's a sexy bitch
