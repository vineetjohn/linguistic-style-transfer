But then I trip upon myself and I fall
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay
But then you print some 
That makes me wanna scream

So do what u want

You can't have my heart
And you won't use my mind but

You can't stop my voice cause
You don't own my life but
Do what u want (with my body)

Early morning, longer nights
Tom Ford, private flights
Crazy schedule, fast life
I wouldn't trade it in
'Cause it's our life
(Let's slow it down…)

I could be the drink in your cup
I could be the green in your blunt
Your pusher man, yea I got what you want
You wanna escape all of the crazy 
You're the Marilyn, I'm the president
And I love to hear you sing, girl

Do what I want
Do what I want with your body
Do what I want
Do what I want with your body
Back of the club, takin' shots, gettin' naughty
No invitations, it's a private party
Do what I want
Do what I want with your body
Do what I want
Do what I want with your body
Yea we takin' these haters and we roughin' 'em up
And we layin' the club like we don't give a 

You can't have my heart
And you won't use my mind but
Do what u want (with my body)
Do what u want with my body
You can't stop my voice cause
You don't own my life but
Do what u want (with my body)
Do what u want (with my body)

Sometimes I'm scared I suppose
If you ever let me go
I would fall apart
If you break my heart
So just take my body
And don't stop the party

You can't have my heart (Help me now)
And you won't use my mind but
Do what u want (with my body)
Do what u want with my body
You can't stop my voice cause
You don't own my life but
Do what u want (with my body)
Do what u want (with my body)

Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body (boy)
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body, world!

Do what you want with my body,
