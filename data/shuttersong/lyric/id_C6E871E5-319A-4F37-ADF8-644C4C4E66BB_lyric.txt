All I
Wanna do is
Live in ectascy
I know what's best for me
I can't help it
It's this hopeless itch
I just wanna feel (wanna feel)
Purple, yellow, red and blue

When I grow up I wanna be
A movie star or on TV
Cuz workin' just don't work for me
But I can't focus feeling hopeless

So I'll just sit back, try to relieve

All I
Wanna do is
Live in ectascy
I know what's best for me

It's this hopeless itch

I just wanna feel (wanna feel)
Purple, yellow, red and blue

When I grow up I wanna be
A rich-kid born celebrity

It's not greed, but necessity
Now I don't focus on the hopeless
When I look out it's only for me

All that I needed
Is something to believe in
Because everything just falls in place like that
