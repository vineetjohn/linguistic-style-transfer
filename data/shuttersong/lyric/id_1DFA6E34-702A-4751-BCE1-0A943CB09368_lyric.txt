Guess it's true
I'm not good at a one night stand
But I still need love 'cause I'm just man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave
Will you hold my hand

Oh, won't you stay with me
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

Why am I so emotional?!
No it's not a good look, gain some self control
Deep down I know this never works?
But you could lay with me
So it doesn't hurt

Oh, won't you stay with me
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

Oooh oh ooh oooh ooooh oh
Oooh oh ooh oooh ooooh oh

Oh, won't you stay with me
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me
Oh, wont you stay with me
Cause you're all I need
This ain't love its clear to see
But darling
Stay with me
