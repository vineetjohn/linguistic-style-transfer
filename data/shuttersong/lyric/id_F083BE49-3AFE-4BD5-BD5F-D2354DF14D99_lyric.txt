She had a cross around her neck
And a flower in her hair
That I picked from the side of Thomas Drive
On our way to the sand
We found an old wooden chair
Still warm from the sun
Pushed it back, gave me a kiss with bacardi on her lips
and I was done

And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted

Like an old beach roller coaster

The rest of those days
Turned into long crazy nights
When the music got loud
We'd sneak away from the crowd under the boardwalk lights
And with all the things we said
What I just can't get past
Is the way we let it end

Now I'm wonderin' where she is
Knowin' I can't get that goodbye back

And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'

Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster

She's like a song playin' over and over
In my mind, where I still hold her
I had the chance and I should've told her

When we spent that last week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I should've known where it was goin'
Still tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
And I should've known that kind of feelin'

Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
When Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted, year, I'm still twisted
Like that old beach roller coaster
Like that old beach roller coaster
