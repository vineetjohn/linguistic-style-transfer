Silent night, holy night!
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin, mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Silent night, holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight!
Glories stream from heaven afar;
Heavenly hosts sing al-le-lu-ia!
Christ the saviour is born
Christ the saviour is born

Silent night, holy night!
Wondrous star, lend thy light!
With the angels let us sing
Alleluia to our king!
Christ the saviour is here,
Jesus the saviour is here

Silent night, holy night!
Son of god, love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face,
With the dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus lord at thy birth
Jesus lord at thy birth
