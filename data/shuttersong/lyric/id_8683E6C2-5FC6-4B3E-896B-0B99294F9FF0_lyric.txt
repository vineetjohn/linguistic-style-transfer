{Hook–IamSu!}:
I'ma throw this money (don't stop go crazy)
I'ma make it back (don't stop go crazy)
Said I'ma throw this money (don't stop go crazy)
And I'ma make it back (don't stop go crazy)
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about

Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about

{1: IamSu!}:
Fontainebleau, M-I-A
You can hang with us baby but you cannot stay
Bitches love a nigga you would think I'm Trey
I told her throw it back for a R-A-C-K
Don't stop get it get it one time for real
I know you got big dreams on your mind for real
I heard you trying to sing, do wanna sign a deal?
You wanna fall back, just take your time and chill
I be out in New Orleans like please believe me
If you really fucking with me say Yeah like Jeezy
Ooh yeah, you like that I like that too
She got kicked out the club I brought her right back through
I got the juice like that, I could get away with murder

And if you ain't knowing you should go ahead and learn it
Burn it, hot shit, cut it out like a surgeon
I'm splurgin on fly shit 'til the day that they bury me

I'ma throw this money (don't stop go crazy)
I'ma make it back (don't stop go crazy)
Said I'ma throw this money (don't stop go crazy)
And I'ma make it back (don't stop go crazy)

Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about

{2: 2 Chainz}:
My role model used to drive a Saab
Still got every chain I had from the start
Just a victim of identity theft
Them ho niggas ordered Victoria Secret cards
Finger your mom with a aged thumb
Money talk so I say sum'n, play sum'n
Why every time I do a feature, it feel like I ate sum'n

Real shit, got the A locked
With my rollie on the West Coast, call it bay watch, nigga
They watch, nigga, put it in a safe box, nigga
Put a fucking dread lock in her, hey!
Throw this money, the trap my habitat
Woke up with money, cause I went to sleep with racks
Real shit

I'ma throw this money (don't stop go crazy)
I'ma make it back (don't stop go crazy)
Said I'ma throw this money (don't stop go crazy)
And I'ma make it back (don't stop go crazy)
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about

{3: Sage The Gemini}:
This is why you know I'm the man
You say you hot but you ain't buzzing like a lava lamp
Breaking hoes hearts in my B-Boy stance
Making this money Bye-Bye like the N-Sync dance
I be running in your mama like it's my last steps
And I'ma balling ass nigga bank with MaxPreps

Ooh yeah, I'm from Seven oh Seven
Used to be on Pintail in front the 7-Eleven
You know she hold it down for a mac
She make it jump like I'm holding on an iPhone app
Like holla, give her that Raymundo
Ride it like a skateboard going hard off this Rocket Power
Now this is only for family
Take your girl bring her back Friday like Stanley

The best french man but you will not can me
Racks on racks so you cannot band me

I'ma throw this money (don't stop go crazy)
I'ma make it back (don't stop go crazy)
Said I'ma throw this money (don't stop go crazy)
And I'ma make it back (don't stop go crazy)
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about

Don't stop go crazy
Don't stop go crazy (Yeah yeah)
Don't stop go crazy
Don't stop go crazy (Yeah yeah)
