Hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better this Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it's gonna be together this Christmas

The fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
This Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me

Let's go

Presents and cards are here
My world is filled with cheer and you this Christmas
And as I look around
Your eyes outshine the town, they do this Christmas

The fireside is blazing bright
And we? re caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me

Shake a hand, shake a hand now

Ooh, the fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
So special for you and me, yes, it will be

Shake a hand now
Come on, everybody shake a hand now
Family and we'll be together
To make this Christmas bright, yes, we will
