All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach
But I stand in California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours

You in those little high waisted shorts, oh
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out

Nothing that wouldn't wanna tell you about no
'Cause it's too cold whoa
For you here and now
So let me hold whoa

Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides our minds
So move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste yeah
These hearts adore
Every other beat the other one beats for
Inside this place is warm

Outside it starts to pour
Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out

Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no
'Cause it's too cold whoa
For you here
And now
So let me hold whoa

Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold whoa
For you here and now
So let me hold whoa

Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
Whoa, whoa...
Whoa, whoa... whoa

Whoa, whoa...
'Cause it's too cold whoa
For you here and now
So let me hold whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
It's too cold whoa
For you here and now
So let me hold whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
It's too cold
It's too cold
The holes of my sweater...
