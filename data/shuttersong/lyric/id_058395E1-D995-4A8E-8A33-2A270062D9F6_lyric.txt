You know that I'm a crazy bitch
I do what I want when I feel like it
All I wanna do is lose control
Oh, oh
But you don't really give a shit
You go with it, go with it, go with it.
'Cause you're fucking crazy rock'n'roll

[Pre-Chorus:]
Yo-u said "Hey,
What's your name?"
It took one look
And now we're not the same
Yeah you said "Hey."
And since that day
You stole my heart
And you're the one to blame

[Chorus:]
(Yeah)
And that's why I smile
It's been a while
Since every day and everything has
Felt this right
And now you turn it all around
And suddenly you're all I need
The reason why I-I-I
I smi-i-ile

Last night I blacked out I think
What did you, what did you put in my drink?
I remember making out and then, oh, oh
I woke up with a new tattoo
Your name was on me and my name was on you
I would do it all over again

[Pre-Chorus:]
Yo-u said "Hey,
What's your name?"
It took one look
And now we're not the same
Yeah you said "Hey."
And since that day
You stole my heart
And you're the one to blame

[Chorus:]
(Yeah)
And that's why I smile
It's been a while
Since every day and everything has
Felt this right
And now you turn it all around
And suddenly you're all I need
The reason why I-I-I
I smi-i-ile
The reason why I-I-I
I smi-i-ile

[Bridge:]
You know that I'm a crazy bitch
I do what I want when I feel like it
All I wanna do is lose control
You know that I'm a crazy bitch
I do what I want when I feel like it
All I wanna do is lose control

[Chorus:]
(Yeah)
And that's why I smile
It's been a while
Since every day and everything has
Felt this right
And now you turn it all around
And suddenly you're all I need
The reason why I-I-I
I smi-i-ile
(The reason) The reason why I-I-I
I smi-i-ile
The reason why I-I-I
I smi-i-ile
