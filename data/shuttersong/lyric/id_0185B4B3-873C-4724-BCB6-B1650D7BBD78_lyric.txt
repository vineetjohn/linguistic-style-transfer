When I'm out walkin' I strut my stuff, man, I'm so strung out
I'm high as a kite, I just might stop to check you out
Let me go on like I blister in the sun
Let me go on, big hands, I know you're the one

Body and beats, I stain my sheets, I don't even know why
My girlfriend, she's at the end, she is starting to cry
Let me go on like I blister in the sun
Let me go on, big hands, I know you're the one
