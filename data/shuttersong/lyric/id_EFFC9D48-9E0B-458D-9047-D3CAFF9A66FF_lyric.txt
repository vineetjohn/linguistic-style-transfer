[Intro]
Worst motherfucker never loved us
Fucker never loved us
You ain't know  now you know now
Still at it  scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit  niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police asking us questions 
Nigga' we don't know shit
Flex  nigga I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin' 
Look at you  look at you  and look at you 
Ahh - I'm glad that they chose us
Command  it's a mission 
Trying to fight to the finish just to see 'em all finish
[Hook]
On my worst behavior  no 
They used to never want to hear us 
Remember 
Motherfucker never loved us  remember 
Motherfucker  remember 
Motherfucker never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior 
Don't you ever get it fucked up
Motherfuckers never loved us
Man  motherfuckers never loved us
Worst behavior
Motherfuckers never loved us
Fucker never loved us
Worst behavior
[Verse 1]
Hold up  hold my phone
Motherfuckers never loved us
Fucker never loved us
Now you want to roll one
Motherfucker never loved us
So everywhere we go now  full cup
Always hated the boy  but now the boy is the man
Motherfucker  I done grown up
You know me  you know me
I'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me
You owe me  you owe me
Bitch you better have my money when I come for the shit like O D B 
On my worst behavior  no 
They used to never want to hear us 
Remember 
Motherfucker never loved us  remember 
Motherfucker  remember 
Motherfucker never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior 
Don't you ever get it fucked up
Motherfuckers never loved us
Man  motherfuckers never loved us

Motherfuckers never loved us
Fucker never loved us
Worst behavior
[Verse 2]
Who's hot  who not
Tell me who rock  who sell out in stores
You tell me who flop  who copped the new drop
Whose jewels got rocks 
Who else making rap albums doing numbers like its pop
Same old pimp 
Drake you know ain't nothing's changed with these funny style niggas
We done put out of the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
And its back to L A  
Open the mail  staring at the check
Enough to make you throw up
Man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set  tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could be Serena when she playing with her left
Oh  where I reside it looks like a resort inside
Nigga  where your shit from 
I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my name Mordehigh
Fuck you bitch  I'm on that high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a m  going shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stunting  I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah  back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time  even the important times
I should let you know ahead of time I'm coming back on my worst behavior
Remember 
Remember 
Motherfucker
Remember 
Hold up  hold my phone  they used to never want to hear us
Remember 
Motherfucker never loved us
Remember 
Motherfucker
Remember 
Worst behavior
