Life can be so hard to breathe
When you're trapped inside a box
You're waiting for a break to come
It always comes too late

You're on the edge just stumbling
And the road it starts to wind
But every time a page is turned
A chance to make it right


Oh the sun will rise
Like a flame ignites


We're not done till we say it's over
We won't fade away


Oh the sun will rise

Tomorrow never dies
(Tomorrow never dies)


It's hard to see the enemy
When you're looking at yourself
Maybe your reflection shows you
Screaming out for help

And you try your best to just keep up
And your feet they fall behind
But the beat you're marching to
You're keeping perfect time


Oh the sun will rise
Like a flame ignites


We're not done till we say it's over
We won't fade away


Oh the sun will rise


Tomorrow never dies

Try your best to change your fate
You can just enjoy the ride
The sun will rise, the moon will fall
Tomorrow never dies
(It never dies)


Oh the sun will rise
(The sun will rise the sun will rise)
Like a flame ignites
(A flame ignites a flame ignites)


We're not done till we say it's over
We won't fade away


Oh the sun will rise


Tomorrow never dies
Tomorrow never dies
Tomorrow never dies
