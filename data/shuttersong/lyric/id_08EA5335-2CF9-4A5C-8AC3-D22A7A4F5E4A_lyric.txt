Ho! Hey! Ho! Hey!
(Ho!) I've been trying to do it right
(Hey!) I've been living a lonely life
(Ho!) I've been sleeping here instead
(Hey!)I've been sleeping in my bed
(Ho!) I've been sleeping in my bed (Hey!)
(Ho!)
(Ho!) So show me family
(Hey!) All the blood that I would bleed
(Ho!) I don't know where I belong
(Hey!) I don't know where I went wrong
(Ho!) But I can write a song (Hey!)
1, 2, 3 I belong with you, you belong with me you're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me you're my sweet (Ho!)
(hey!)
(ho!)
(hey!)
(ho!) I don't think you're right for him
(hey!) Look at what it might have been if you
(ho!) Took the bus to china town
(hey!) I've been standing on Canal
(ho!) And Bowery (hey!)
(ho!) And she'd be standing next to me (hey!)
1, 2, 3 I belong with you you belong with me you're my sweet heart
I belong with you, you belong with me you're my sweet heart
And love we need is now
Let's hope for some
Cause oh, we're bleeding out
I belong with you you belong with me you're my sweet heart
I belong with you you belong with me you're my sweet (Ho!)
(Hey!)
(Ho!)
(Hey!)
