I like us better when we're wasted

It makes it easier to fake it

The only time we really talk

Is when our clothes are coming off

I like us better when we're wasted

It makes it easier to say it

Lay all your laundry on the bed

And then I'll lay in it instead

I like us better when we're wasted

Oh oh oh oh

You are a glass half empty

Sipping my ocean dry

Emotionally spent me

Til none of our planets could align

But I could stand you one more night

I like us better when we're wasted

It makes it easier to say it

Lay all your laundry on the bed

And then I'll lay in it instead

I like us better when we're wasted

Oh oh oh oh

You are a catch 22

Either way I miss out

All of the grief I'd give you

Is energy I can live without

But I could stand you one more night

I like us better when we're wasted

It makes it easier to say it

Lay all your laundry on the bed

And then I'll lay in it instead

I like us better when we're wasted

Oh oh oh oh

I like us better when we're wasted

It makes it easier to say it

Lay all your laundry on the bed

And then I'll lay in it instead

I like us better when we're wasted

Oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh
