Blink 182 - Always
I¡äve been here before a few times
And I¡äm quite aware we¡äre dying
And your hands they shake with goodbyes
And I¡äll take you back if you¡äd have me
So here I am I¡äm trying
So here I am are you ready
Come on let me hold you touch you feel you
I¡äve been here before a few times
Always
Kiss you taste you all night
Always
And I¡äll miss your laugh your smile
I¡äll admit I¡äm wrong if you¡äd tell me
I¡äm so sick of fights I hate them
Lets start this again for real
So here I am I¡äm trying
So here I am are you ready
So here I am I¡äm trying
So here I am are you ready
Come on let me hold you touch you feel you
Always
Kiss you taste you all night
Come on let me hold you touch you feel you
Always
Kiss you taste you all night
Always
And I¡äm quite aware we¡äre dying
Come on let me hold you touch you feel you
Always
Always
Come on let me hold you touch you feel you
Always
Always
Always
Always
