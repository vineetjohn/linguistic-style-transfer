Are you, are you
Coming to the tree?
They strung up a man
They say who murdered three.
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight
In the hanging tree.

Are you, are you
Coming to the tree?
Where dead man called out
For his love to flee.
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight
In the hanging tree.

Are you, are you
Coming to the tree?
Where dead man called out
For his love to flee.
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight
In the hanging tree.

Are you, are you
Coming to the tree?
Where I told you to run
So we'd both be free.
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight
In the hanging tree.

Are you, are you
Coming to the tree?
Wear a necklace of rope
Side by side with me.
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight
In the hanging tree.
