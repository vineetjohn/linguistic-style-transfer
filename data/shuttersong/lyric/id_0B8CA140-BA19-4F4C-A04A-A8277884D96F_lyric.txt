Strictly outta curiosity
What would happen if you got with me?
Kissin' you would hit the spot with me
Come on skip a couple rocks with me
Gimme any of your heart tonight
Ain't no reason that we need to be apart tonight
I got somethin' we could start tonight
Lookin' at you girl it's hard to fight
Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes baby they're fixed on you in your snapback
T-shirt of your favorite rock band
Checkin' your makeup in my Ray Bans
Breakin' hearts like only you can in your snapback
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
In your snapback
Come on baby shoot a smile at me
Midnight selfie on a balcony
A little somethin' for my lock screen
You're burnin' a hole in my pocket
And we got the beat let's drop it
Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes baby they're fixed on you in your snapback
Tattoos, cutoffs and converse
Singin' along to the song with the wrong words
Every move you make baby it works in your snapback
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
In your snapback
Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes baby they're fixed on you in your snapback
T-shirt of your favorite rock band
Checkin' your make-up in my Ray Bans
Breakin' hearts like only you can in your snapback
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
In your snapback
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
In your snapback
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
In your snapback
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
In your snapback
