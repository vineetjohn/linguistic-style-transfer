We always dreamed about this better life, this better life

We always thought we'd come in all along, yeah all along

We got the kiss, and walked through paradise, yeah paradise

Now let's go walking hand in hand

Come on baby we can hit the lights

Make the rooms go right

We can smash the floor, make the pop go raw

We're the love mystique, we dont need no sleep

And it feels like we could do this all night

We could do this all night

Yeah everything is alright

We got the kiss, and walked through paradise, yeah paradise

It feels like....we could do this all night

(we could do this all night)

Oh when the men under the summer skies, the summer skies

The seasons changed, our house will stay the same, yeah stay the same

We got that burning feeling, start a fire, start a fire

Giving a shout, let's make it hot

Come on baby we can hit the lights

Make the rooms go right

We can smash the floor, make the pop go raw

We're the love mystique, we dont need no sleep

And it feels like we could do this all night

We could do this all night

Yeah everything is alright

We got the kiss, and walked through paradise, yeah paradise

It feels like....we could do this all night

Feels like....we could do this all night

All night, all night, all night, all night, all night, all night

Come on baby we can hit the lights

Make the rooms go right

We can smash the floor, make the pop go raw

We're the love mystique, we don't need no sleep

And it feels like.........we could do this all night

We could do this all night

We could do this all night

We could do this all night

Yeah everything is alright

We got the kiss, and walked through paradise, yeah paradise

It feels like....we could do this all night
