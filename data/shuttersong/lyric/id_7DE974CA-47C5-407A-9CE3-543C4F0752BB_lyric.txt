Whoa oh whoa oh
Whoa oh whoa oh
Vengaboys are back in town
Whoa oh whoa oh
Whoa oh whoa oh
Whoa oh whoa oh
Whoa oh whoa oh

If you're alone and you need a friend
Someone to make you forget your problems
Just come along baby
Take my hand
I'll be your lover tonight

[Pre-chorus:]
Whoa oh whoa oh
This is what I wanna do
Whoa oh whoa oh
Let's have some fun
Whoa oh whoa oh
One on one just me and you
Whoa oh whoa oh

[Chorus:]
Boom boom boom boom
I want you in my room
Let's spend the night together
From now until forever
Boom boom boom boom
I wanna double boom
Let's spend the night together
Together in my room

Whoa oh whoa oh
Everybody get on down
Whoa oh whoa oh
Vengaboys are back in town
