Come and kiss me, baby
We don't need no mistletoe
We don't need no fireplace
Boy, I'll keep you nice and warm

Are you down for some of these milk and cookies?
Down for loving, you'll be my drummer boy
And I'm the only drum that you gonna play
'Tis the season for some love giving
So I think you should give your love to me
Baby, let me know

Are you with it? Are you with it?
Are you with it this Christmas? (Baby, let me know)
Are you with it? Are you with it?
Are you with it this Christmas?

We don't need no presents, we don't need the kitchen
We don't need the masterpiece
You know I'm tasty like a candy cane or gingerbread
Oh baby love

Are you down for some of these milk and cookies?
Down for loving, you'll be my drummer boy
And I'm the only drum that you gonna play
'Tis the season for some love giving
So I think you should give your love to me
Baby, let me know
Are you with it? Are you with it?
Are you with it this Christmas? (Baby, let me know)
Are you with it? Are you with it?
Are you with it this Christmas?
