It's the third of October
You should come over
Best laid plans I've had sober
And maybe not the way we thought we planned
Both of us will take this hand
For a couple of days then we'll disappear
We don't have to talk of where we go from here
Oh, my dearly departed
My dearly departed

One final shoulder
Here before were none
And then there were none
This last call could be all we can do for each other
Embrace for a dear old friend
Bring wine to bed
We'll toast what could have been
My dearly departed

To my dearly departed

I don't know how to mend it
When this chapter ended
When all of my plans have depended on you
But at least tonight we'll still pretend
Hold each other close like its not the end
And you can send me balloons, and we can laugh at the doom
We both thought of that doesn't it say something to

Oh my dearly departed
My dearly departed

One final shoulder
Here before were none
Until all are none
This last call could be all we can do for each other
Embrace for a dear old friend
Bring wine to bed

We'll toast what could have been
My dearly departed
To my dearly departed

Every masterpiece I'd write again
You'll always be my porcelain
I crossed my heart but I stuttered too
So truth or dare was I good to you?

And I had enough of you all to myself
Still right beside you in sickness and health
Forever after you will be my home
And there's no place like home

We never sent the cards, they're all still on the table
Wanna throw them out but I'm just not able
My dearly departed
My dearly departed
Toast what could
(What could have been)
Toast what could
(What could have been)
Dear old friend
Toast what could
(What could have been)
Dear old friend
Toast what could
(What could have been)
My dearly departed
Dear old friend
Toast what could
(What could have been)
My dearly departed
Dear old friend
Toast what could
(What could have been)
My dearly departed
Toast what could
What could have been
My dearly departed
My dear old friend
End
