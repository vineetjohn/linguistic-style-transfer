
She was covered in leather and gold
21 years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair she's out there
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn

[Verse 1]
Little Ms. Perfect
Sitting at the train stop
Red Nike high tops
Listening to hip-hop
While we were waiting
Started conversating
Before I got her name
Along came a train

[Pre-Chorus:]
Oh, oh
Next stop Brooklyn
Oh, oh,
Now I'm lookin'

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
On the street kicking rocks
Circling the same block
Green point to Flatbush
Checking every corner shop
Tapping people's shoulders
Asking if they know her
Everyday's the same
It's back to the train

[Pre-Chorus:]
Oh, oh
Next stop Brooklyn
Oh, oh
I'm still looking

[Chorus]

[2x]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I wonder will we ever meet again

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I wonder if we ever meet again

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I hope we do
Somewhere in Brooklyn
