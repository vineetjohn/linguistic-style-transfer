Calling all the girls
There's an SOS tonight, let's have some fun
One hundred percent
Every single chase somehow these days are gone, yeah

There's gonna be a million faces up in this room ooh
But the only one who gets my attention is you, you

I got my best on and I feel like dancing all night long
Nothing's gonna stop me
Oh but I want
So baby come and get me, cause I don't wanna dance alone

Oh it's been so long
Thinking ‘bout the feeling of your arms wrapped around my body
It's what I want
So baby come and get me, cause I don't wanna dance alone

And on the floor
I can feel you staring at me across the room, ooh
Whatcha waiting for
All I want is you so come and make a move

I see a million silver lights up in this room, ooh
I wanna be the one who gets the attention from you, oh

I got my best on and I feel like dancing all night long
Nothing's gonna stop me
Oh but I want
So baby come and get me, cause I don't wanna dance alone

Oh it's been so long
Thinking ‘bout the feeling of your arms wrapped around my body
It's what I want
So baby come and get me, cause I don't wanna dance alone

If you come in close
Babe I won't say no
Baby all I want is you
If you move too slow
Then you'll never know
All the things that we could do

If you come in close
Babe I won't say no
Baby all I want is you
If you move too slow
Then you'll never know
All the things that we could do

I got my best on and I feel like dancing all night long
Nothing's gonna stop me
Oh but I want
So baby come and get me, cause I don't wanna dance alone

Oh it's been so long
Thinking ‘bout the feeling of your arms wrapped around my body
It's what I want
So baby come and get me, cause I don't wanna dance alone

I don't wanna dance alone
I don't wanna dance alone
