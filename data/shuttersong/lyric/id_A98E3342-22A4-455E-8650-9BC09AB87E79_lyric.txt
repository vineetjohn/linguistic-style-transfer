I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did

And you were strong and I was not
My illusion
My mistake
I was careless

I forgot
I did
And now
When all is done
There is nothing to say

You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won
You can go ahead
Tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken

All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know
I know and thinking all you need is there

Building faith on love and words
Empty promises we'll wear

I know
I know and now
When all is done
There is nothing to say

And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead
Tell them
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line

All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open

Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
Oh, what I hoped would be
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible
