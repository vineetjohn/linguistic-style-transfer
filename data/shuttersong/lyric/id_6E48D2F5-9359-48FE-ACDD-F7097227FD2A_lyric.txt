Crying up above, I'm just here to take you away
Don't worry 'bout a thing, I'm just focused on you today

You're laid out
You were raised up in a poor town
Roll up, baby roll up
So hard to leave, but I know I gotta go now
Paris and London (on top of the world)
Baby we're so down (will you be my girl?)
Something I wanna say
Yeah, you know I'll be there

I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close babe, close to my heart
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close babe, close to my heart

I see my phone ring, hope it's you babe,
You sent me a picture, well I sent one too
I'm just tryna keep this love on track
Oh babe, I got your heart and I won't give it back

Holding you close to my heart
Uh, yeah, so I'm laid back in the Maybach
Damn these seats go way back
I was thinking about way back
When we used to say that
I was yours, you were mine
And we fought to pass the time
And I realized, I realized, that we
(Babe) no matter what
(Babe) no matter what
(Babe) no matter what oh
Babe, babe, babe, yeah, yeah

I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
