Hey, yo, Jason
Say somethin' to her
Holla at her
I got one question
How do you fit all that in them jeans?
You know what to do with that big fat butt

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Just a little bit

Patty, cake, patty, cake with no hands
Got me in this club, making wedding plans
If I take pictures while you do your dance
I could make you famous on Instagram
Hot damn it, your booty like two planets
Go ahead, and go ham sandwich
Woah, I can't stand it
'Cause you know what to do with that big fat butt

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Just a little bit

Cadillac, Cadillac, pop that trunk
Let's take a shot, Alley oop that dunk
Tired of working that nine to five
Oh, baby, let me come and change your life
Hot damn it, your booty like two planets
Go ahead, and go ham sandwich
Woah, I can't stand it
'Cause you know what to do with that big fat butt

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Shake it, shake it girl
Just a little bit
Little bit, little bit, little bit
Shake what your mamma gave you, misbehave you

I just wanna strip you, dip you, flip you, bubble bathe you
What they do
Taste my raindrops, k boo?
Now what you're willing, what you wanting, what you may do
Completely separated til I deeply penetrate it
Then I take it out and wipe it off
Eat it, ate it, love it, hate it
Overstated, underrated, everywhere I being King
You wiggle wiggle for the D-O-double G again
Come on, baby, turn around
You're a star, girl, take a bow
It's just one thing that's killing me
How do you fit that in them jeans?
You know what to do with that big fat butt
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Shake it, shake it girl
Just a little bit
Little bit, little bit, little bit
Now make it clap (wiggle, wiggle, wiggle)
Damn baby, you got a bright future behind you
