Closing time, open all the doors
And let you out into the world
Closing time, turn all of the lights on
Over every boy and every girl.

Closing time, one last call for alcohol
So finish your whiskey or beer
Closing time, you don't have to go home
But you can't stay here.

I know who I want to take me home
I know who I want to take me home
I know who I want to take me home
Take me home.

Closing time, time for you to go out
To the places you will be from
Closing time, this room won't be open
Till your brothers or your sisters come.

So gather up your jackets, move it to the exits
I hope you have found a friend
Closing time, every new beginning
Comes from some other beginning's end, yeah.

I know who I want to take me home
I know who I want to take me home
I know who I want to take me home
Take me home.

Closing time, time for you to go out
To the places you will be from.
I know who I want to take me home
I know who I want to take me home
I know who I want to take me home
Take me home.
Closing time, every new beginning
Comes from some other beginning's end.
