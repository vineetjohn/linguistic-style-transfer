Usher baby, yeah
Did it again
And this time I'mma scream
(Usher) yeah man

I see you over there so hypnotic
Thinkin' 'bout what I'd do to that body
I'd get you like ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
Got no drink in my hand, but I'm wasted
Getting drunk on the thought of you naked
I get you like ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
And I tried to fight it, to fight it
But you're so magnetic, magnetic
Got one life, just live it, just live it
Now relax and get on your back

If you wanna scream yeah
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you goin' like ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby, ooh baby
If you want it done right
Hope you're ready to go all night
Get you goin' like ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby, ooh baby
If you wanna scream

Kill the lights, shut 'em off, you're electric
Devil eyes tellin' me come and get it
I have you like ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
Girl tonight, you're the prey, I'm the hunter
Take you here, take you there, take you under
Imagine me, whisperin' in your ear that I wanna
Take off all your clothes and put somethin' on ya
And I tried to fight it, to fight it
But you're so magnetic, magnetic
Got one life, just live it, just live it
Now relax and get on your back

If you wanna scream yeah
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you goin' like ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby, ooh baby
If you want it done right
Hope you're ready to go all night
Get you goin' like ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby, ooh baby
I'mma make you scream out louder, scream, (usher) louder
(If you wanna scream)
Louder, louder, louder, la da da da da
Hey, somebody scream out on me!

If you wanna scream

Yeah
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you goin' like ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby, ooh baby
If you want it done right
Hope you're ready to go all night
Get you goin' like ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby, ooh baby
If you wanna scream
