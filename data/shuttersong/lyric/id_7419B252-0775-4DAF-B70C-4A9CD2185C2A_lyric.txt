Rushing in a small town
I forgot to call you
I'm running low on know how
This beat's made for two

Cause I remember that I like you
No matter what I found
She said, "It's nice to have your friends round
We're watching the television with no sound"

It's just you and I tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?
It's just you and I tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?

Push your lack of chest out, look at my hair
God I love the way you love yourself
Your obsession with rocks and brown
And fucking the whole town's
Do a reflection on your mental health

Cause I remember when I found you
Much younger than you are now
And once we started having friends round
You created a television of your mouth

It's just you and I tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?
It's just you and I tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?

You got something to say?
Why don't you speak it out loud, instead of living in your head?
It's always the same.
Why don't you take your heart out, instead of living in your head?

It's just you and I tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?
It's just you and I tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?
