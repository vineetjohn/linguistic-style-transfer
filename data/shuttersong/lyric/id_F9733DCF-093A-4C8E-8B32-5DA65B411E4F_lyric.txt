I've seen the world
Done it all, had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel-Air now
Hot summer nights mid July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, the city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

Will you still love me when
I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when
I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will
I know you will

I know that you will

Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in, the New Age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll

The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know

Your pretty face and electric soul
Will you still love me when
I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when
I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Dear lord when I get to heaven
Please let me bring my man
When he comes tell me that you let him in
Father tell me if you can
Oh that grace, oh that body
Oh that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds
Will you still love me when
I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when
I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me when
I'm not young and beautiful?
