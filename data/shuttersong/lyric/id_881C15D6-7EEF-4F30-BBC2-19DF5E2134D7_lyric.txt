The morning comes
My mind rolls back
My body's weightless
My world goes black

Slow down my heartbeat
Slow down my heartbeat
Slow down my heartbeat
Slow down my heartbeat

A loud scream in
My hands are bound
The world's still breathing
But there's no sound

Slow down my heartbeat
Slow down my heartbeat
Slow down my heartbeat
Slow down my heartbeat

Euphoria's gone
It's time to move on
I have to believe we can change

My world's gone all wrong
Stop swimming along
We can't be the same old thing

Euphoria's gone
It's time to move on
I have to believe we can change

My world's gone all wrong
Stop swimming along
We can't be the same old thing

Euphoria's gone
It's time to move on
I have to believe we can change

My world's gone all wrong
Stop swimming along
We can't be the same old thing

Euphoria's gone

Euphoria's gone

Euphoria's gone

Euphoria's gone

Euphoria's gone
