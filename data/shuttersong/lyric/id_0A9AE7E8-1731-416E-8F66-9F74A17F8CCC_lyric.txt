Yo, ayo tonight is the night that I'ma get twisted
Myx Moscato and vodka, I'ma mix it
Roll that spaceship, we about to get lifted
Live in the present, that gift is for the gifted
This what you came, this what you came for
You get what you buy, this what you paid for
So make sure the stars is what you aim for
Make mistakes though

I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride
What is the hurry? It's pretty early
It's ok, we'll take our time

The night is still young
The night is still young
The night is still young
And so are we

The night is still young (How dare we sit quietly)
The night is still young (And watch the world pass us by)
The night is still young (How dare we sit quietly)
So are we

Ayo, drinks on you or the drinks is on me
We ain't going nowhere like tanks is on E
We still getting money, what bank it's gon' be?
If he's sexy, he plankin' on me
So where them big boys with all of that?
Hey! Tell the bartender, say my order back
Hey! It's bottle service, he ordered that
Hey! Might let him take it home and slaughter that
He got friends for all of my friends
They ain't leavin' til we say when
And we gonna hangover the next day
But we will remember this day
So drop the pop and get low
Or we can drop the top and just cruise
We fresh to death, down to the shoes
My only motto in life is don't lose

I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride
What is the hurry? It's pretty early
It's ok, we'll take our time

The night is still young
The night is still young
The night is still young
And so are we

The night is still young (How dare we sit quietly)
The night is still young (And watch the world pass us by)
The night is still young (How dare we sit quietly)
So are we

We're just gettin' started, yeah, yeah
We're just gettin' started, yeah, yeah
Can't you see the night's still early
And we gon' get it wild and crazy

We're just gettin' started, yeah, yeah
We're just gettin' started, yeah, yeah
Can't you see the night's still early
And we gon' get it wild and crazy

The night is still young
The night is still young
The night is still young
And so are we
The night is still young (How dare we sit quietly)
The night is still young (And watch the world pass us by)
The night is still young (How dare we sit quietly)
So are we
(How dare we sit quietly)
(And watch the world pass us by)
(How dare we sit quietly)
(And watch the world pass us by)
