Cork's off, it's on
The party's just begun
I promise this
Drink is my last one
I know I fucked up again
'Cause I lost my only friend
God forgive my sins
Don't leave me, I
Oh, I'd hate myself until I die

My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry and I love you
Stay with me, bell bottom blue
I'll keep on searching for an answer 'cause I need you more than Dope

I need you more than Dope
I need you more than Dope
I need you more than Dope
I need you more than Dope

Toast one last puff
And two last regrets
Three spirits and
Twelve lonely steps
Up heaven's stairway to gold
Mine myself like coal
A mountain of his soul
Each day I cry
Oh, I feel so low from living high

My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry and I love you
Stay with me, bell bottom blue
I'll keep on searching for an answer 'cause I need you more than Dope

I need you more than Dope
I need you more than Dope
I need you more than Dope
I need you more than Dope
I need you more
Need you more
I need you more than Dope
