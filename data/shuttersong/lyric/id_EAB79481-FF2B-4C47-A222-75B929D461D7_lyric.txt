"Summer Love"
[Zayn:]
Can't believe you're packing your bags
Trying so hard not to cry
Had the best time and now it's the worst time
But we have to say goodbye
[Harry:]
Don't promise that you're gonna write
Don't promise that you'll call
Just promise that you won't forget we had it all
[Niall:]
Cause you were mine for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember
You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love
[Louis:]
Wish that we could be alone now
If we could find some place to hide
Make the last time just like the first time
Push a button and rewind
[Liam:]
Don't say the word that's on your lips
Don't look at me that way
Just promise you'll remember
When the tide is grey
[Niall:]
Cause you were mine for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember
You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love
[Zayn:]
So please don't make this any harder
We can't take this any farther
And I know there's nothin that I wanna change  change
[All:]
Cause you were mine for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember
You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love
You always will be my summer love
You always will be my summer love
