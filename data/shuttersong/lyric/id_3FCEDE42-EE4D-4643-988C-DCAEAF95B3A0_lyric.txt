I like the sound of the broken pieces
I like the lights and the siren she says
We got machines but the kid's got Jesus
We like to move but we both don't need this

God can't hear you, they won't fight you
Watch them build a friend just like you
Morning sickness, XYZ
Teenage girls with ESP
Give me the sound to see

Another world outside that's full of
All the broken things that I made
Just give me a life to bleed
Another world outside that's full of
All the awful things that I made
We like to dance but the dead go faster

Turn up the slam/hound/bar/code/blast/her
We want the cash or the junk you're after
Rez-up control for the mixtape master
Cell-correction, mass dissection

Death-squad brats are in detention
Morning sickness, XYZ
Boys with bombs in NMA
Carbon-lacing, spent-shell casings
Photographs that I'm erasing

Bonus lives with pixel screams
Girls with guns on LSD
Cell-infectiom, mass destruction
Program for the final function
Lab rat king, rescue team

Save me from the next life
Give me the sound to see
Another world outside that's full of
All the broken things that I made
Just give me a life to bleed

Another world outside that's full of
All the awful things that I made
Cause we are the last disease
Another broken life that's full of
All the awful things that I made
And we got the eyes to see
Another broken life that's full of
All the awful things that I made
