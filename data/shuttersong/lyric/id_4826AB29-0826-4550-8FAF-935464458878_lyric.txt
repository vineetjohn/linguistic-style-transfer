I looked in my rear view mirror and
It seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us
Ahead of us, yeah
I'm ready to make that turn
Before we both crash and burn
'Cause that could be the death of us
The death of us, baby
you know how to drive in rain

And You decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Going the wrong way home
I feel like my heart is stuck in

bumper to bumper
Traffic, I'm under pressure
'Cause I can't have you
The way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on
Honeymoon Avenue

Honeymoon Avenue
Baby, coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was, hey
What happened to the butterflies
Guess they didn't count at that stop sign
And my heart is at a yellow light

A yellow light, hey
Right when I think that we found it
Well that's when we start turnin' around
You're saying baby don't worry
But we're still going the wrong way
Baby you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Going the wrong way home
I feel like my heart is stuck in

bumper to bumper
Traffic, I'm under pressure
'Cause I can't have you
The way that I want

Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on
Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue
Baby, coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was
They say only fools fall in love

Well they must've been talking about us
And sometimes I feel like
I've been here before
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right
We gon' be lost if we continue to fight
Honey I know, yeah

we can find our way home
I feel like my heart is stuck in
bumper to bumper
Traffic, I'm under pressure
'Cause I can't have you
The way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on
Honeymoon Avenue

Honeymoon Avenue
My baby, coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was
When we were on
Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue
Baby, coastin' like crazy

Can we get back to the way it was
Baby you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Going the wrong way home
I feel like my heart is stuck in...
Traffic, I'm under... Pressure, pressure
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on
