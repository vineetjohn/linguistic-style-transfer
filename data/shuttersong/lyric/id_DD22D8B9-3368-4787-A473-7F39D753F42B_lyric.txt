"True Colors"
(feat. Jenna Ushkowitz)

You with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged
Oh I realize
It's hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
And the darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small

But I see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful
Like a rainbow

Show me a smile then
Don't be unhappy, can't remember
When I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there

And I'll see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
I see your true colors
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful
Like a rainbow

Cant remember when I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there

And I'll see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors

True colors

See your true colors

Shining through

YEAH!

I can see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid
To let them show
Your true colors
True colors
True colors
Are Beautiful like the Rainbow
