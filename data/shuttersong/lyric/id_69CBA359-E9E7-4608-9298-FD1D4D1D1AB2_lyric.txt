Don't you wanna see the world, boy
All the countries and the stars, boy?
Just don't look them in the eyes, boy
You just gotta take their lives, boy

Let me take you for a drive, boy
Oh, I swear you'll feel alive boy
All you gotta do is trust that I'm being true
And do it for the people who love you

Let's go have fun, you and me in the old jeep
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun
You and me in the old jeep
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East.
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun

Listen to what I tell you
You'll see, my son
Now you know what you gotta do.
Let's go have fun

When you're standing on the line, boy
Don't go looking for goodbye, boy
Yeah you gotta set them free, boy
'Cause you know that's what they need, boy.
Yeah, you're gonna make them cry, boy

Til' they put you in the ground, boy.
All you gotta do is trust that I'm being true
And do it for the people who love you.

Let's go have fun, you and me in the old jeep.
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat.
Fun, you and me in the Middle East.
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun.
