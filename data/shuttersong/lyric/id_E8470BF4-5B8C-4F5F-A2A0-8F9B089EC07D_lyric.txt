Hey little girl is your daddy home
Did he go and leave you all alone
I got a bad desire
Oh-oh-oh  I'm on fire
Tell me now baby is he good to you
Can he do to you the things I don't do
I can take you higher
Oh-oh-oh  I'm On Fire I'm on fire
Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby
Edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley
Through the middle of my soul
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the
Middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
Oh-oh-oh  I'm on fire
