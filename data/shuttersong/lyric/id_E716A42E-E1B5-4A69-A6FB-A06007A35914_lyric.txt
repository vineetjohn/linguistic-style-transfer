Where are you now?
Who's holdin' you now?
When your world stands still, do you remember?
Leaves were fallin'
We were fallin'
Almost like a dream, do you remember?

Seasons changed
We both changed
Sometimes I go back to when

We ran, put our feet in the water
We danced, didn't care who could see
We sang every song to each other
Summer would end, but not for me
I still feel the hope in your kisses
I still feel the sun on your skin
I swear I was holdin' forever back then
Do you remember?

Where I am now
Is where I should be now
You're so far away, but always with me

And it seems like
Another life
Whenever I go back to when

We ran, put our feet in the water
We danced, didn't care who could see
We sang every song to each other
Summer would end, but not for me
I still feel the hope in your kisses
I still feel the sun on your skin
I swear I was holdin' forever back then
Do you remember?

We ran, we kissed, we learned to love, to live

We ran, put our feet in the water
We danced, didn't care who could see
We sang every song to each other
Summer would end, but not for me
I still feel the hope in your kisses
I still feel the sun on your skin
I swear I was holdin' forever back then
Do you remember?
Do you remember?
