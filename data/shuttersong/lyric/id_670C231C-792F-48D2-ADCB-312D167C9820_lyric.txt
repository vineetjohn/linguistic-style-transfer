I see you had your mind all made up
You group of pitiful liars
Before I woke to face the day
Your master plan transpired
Something told me
This job has more to meet the eye
My song is not believed?
My words somewhat deceiving?

Now I'm unwhole

You waged your war of nerves
But you can't crush the kingdom
Can't be what your idols are
Can't leave the scar
You cry for compensation

I ask you please just give us

5 minutes alone
Just give me
5 minutes alone, yeah!

I read your eyes, your mind was made up
You took me for a fool
You used complexion of my skin
For a counter racist tool
You can't burn me
I've spilled my guts out in the past
Taken advantage of
Cause you know where I come from

My past

You've waged a war of nerves
But you can't crush the kingdom
Can't be what your idols are
Can't leave that scar
I'll pay your compensation

I ask you please just give us

5 minutes alone
Just give me
5 minutes alone, yeah!

Head bangs on broken glass
5 minutes alone
Just give me, yeah!

I ask you please just give us

5 minutes alone
Just give me
5 minutes alone, yeah!

I ask you please just give us

5 minutes alone
