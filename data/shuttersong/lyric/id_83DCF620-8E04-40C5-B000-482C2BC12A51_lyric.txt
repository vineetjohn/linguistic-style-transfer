I don't like the way he's looking at you,
I'm starting to think you want him too.
Am I crazy? Have I lost ya.
Even though I know you love me,
Can't help it.

I turn my cheek, music up,
And I'm puffing my chest.
I'm turnig red in the face, you
Can call me obsessed.

It's not your fault that they hover,
I mean no disrespect.
It's my right to be hellish,
I still get jealous.

Cause you're too sexy, beautiful,
And everybody wants a taste.
That's why (that's why)
I still get jealous.

Cause you're too sexy, beautiful,
And everybody wants a taste.
That's why (that's why)
I still get jealous.

I wish you didn't have to post it all,
I wish you'd save a little bit just for me.
Protective or possessive (yeah),
Call it passive or aggressive.

You're the only one invited,

Cause you know I get excited (yeah),
When you get jealous too.
