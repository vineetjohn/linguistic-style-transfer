Hey baby won't you look my way,
I could be your new addiction
Hey baby what you got to say,
All you're giving me is fiction
I'm a sorry sucker and this happens all the time
I find out that
Everybody talks
Everybody talks
Everybody talks
Everybody talks

Chorus:
It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my Lips hurt
I can even chit-chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always got a backtrack
And everybody talks babe

Hey honey you could be my drug
You could be my new prescription
Too much, get me an overdose
All this stress talk make me itching
On my mouth yeah
Everybody talks
Everybody talks
Everybody talks
Too much

Chorus:
It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my Lips hurt
I can even chit-chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always got a backtrack
And everybody talks babe

Never thought I'd live to see the day
When everybody's words got in the way

Hey sugar show me all your love
All you're giving me is friction
Hey sugar what you got to say

Chorus:
It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my Lips hurt
I can even chit-chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always got a backtrack
And everybody talks babe

Everybody talks
Everybody talks
Everybody talks
It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
Everybody talks
Everybody talks
Everybody talks
Yeah
