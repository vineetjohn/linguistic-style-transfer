Heart beats steady, baby, ready to play
Just let the disco light come and take us away
I feel the heat like a fire bring it closer to me
Just let it out
Is like a spark burning steady from the east to the west
I feel the bass beating louder bring it out of my chest
I like the way that you do it, 'cause you do it the best
So glad i've found you
You and i, will dance untill we die
Crazy, sexy, wild, we just wanna let it out
Touch my body, with the music, baby, you know i want it
You and i, will dance untill we die
Crazy, sexy, wild, we just wanna let it out
Touch my body, with the music, baby, you know i want it
Move to the right, right
Up and down crazy, sexy wild
Move to the right, right
Pump it loud, sexy wild
Move to the right, right
Up and down crazy, sexy wild
Move to the right, right

Up and down crazy, sexy
You and i, will dance untill we die
Crazy, sexy, wild, we just wanna let it out
Touch my body, with the music, baby, you know i want it
Heart beats steady, baby, ready to play
Just let the disco light come and take us away
I feel the heat like a fire bring it closer to me
Just let it out
You and i, will dance untill we die
Crazy, sexy, wild, we just wanna let it out
Touch my body, with the music, baby, you know i want it
You and i, will dance untill we die
Crazy, sexy, wild, we just wanna let it out
Touch my body, with the music, baby, you know i want it
You and i, will dance untill we die
Crazy, sexy, wild, we just wanna let it out
Touch my body, with the music, baby, you know i want it
You and i
You and i
You and i
You and i
