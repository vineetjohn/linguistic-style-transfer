Nothing can stop me, I'm  all  the  way  up
Shorty what you want? Shorty what you need?
My niggas run  the game, we ain't ever leavin'
Countin'  up this money, we ain't never sleepin'
You got V12, I got 12 V's

Nothing can stop me, I'm  all  the  way  up
For my niggas with Bentley coupes and Rolexes
Kicked  the bitch out  the room and gave her no breakfast
Had to stash  the jewels, these bitches so reckless
Keep my hoes on cruise, I'm talkin' naughty nothings
Shorty uptown showin' off her new things
Couldn't take it  all so I gave her un chin
She call me top shotta, yeah I keep a few tings
Champion sound, yeah I got a few rings
And I'm  all  the  way  up
And you can stay  up
And if you ask anybody where I live
They'll point to  the hills and say
Go  all  the  way  up
Go  all  the  way  up
I'm  all  the  way  up
I'm  all  the  way  up
Nothing can stop me, I'm  all  the  way  up
Just left  the big house to a bigger house
Ain't have a girlfriend but  the bitch is out
Chanel croc bag, shit ain't even out
With  the gold chains, Himalayan, Birkin cocaine
Lit it  up, Pac shit, I hit 'em  up
I'm talkin' color money, purple yen and blue dirham
I got brown lira, I ain't talkin' 'bout Ross bitch
I'm that nigga on Viagra dick
That means I'm  all  the  way  up
And you can stay  up
P.O.s say I can't get high
Hopped in  the helicopter Uber and said...
Go  all  the  way  up
Go  all  the  way  up
I'm  all  the  way  up
I'm  all  the  way  up
Nothing can stop me, I'm  all  the  way  up
Shorty what you want? Shorty what you need?
My niggas run  the game, we ain't ever leavin'
Countin'  up this money, we ain't never sleepin'
