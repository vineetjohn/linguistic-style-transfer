Lickwood means rewind, a gunshot means forward
You requested it so we rewind

I got enemies, I got a lotta enemies
Got a lotta people tryna drain me of my energy
They tryna take the waaave from a nigga
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga

I got girls in real life tryna fuck up my day
Fuck goin' online that ain't part of my day
I got real shit poppin' with my family too
I got niggas that can never leave Canada too
I got 2 mortgages, thirty million in total
I got niggas that'll still try fuckin' me over
I got rap niggas that I gotta act like I like
But my actin' days are over, fuck them niggas for life, yea

I got enemies, I got a lotta enemies
Got a lotta people tryna drain me of my energy
They tryna take the waaave from a nigga
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga

I got people talkin' down, man, like I give a fuck
I bought this one a purse, I bought this one a truck
I bought this one a house, I bought this one a mall
I keep buyin' shit just make sure you keep track of it all
I got bitches askin' me about the code for the wifi
So they can talk about they timeline
And show me pictures of they friends
Just to tell me they ain't really friends

Ex-girl she the female version of me
I got strippers in my life, but they virgins to me
I heard everybody talkin bout what they gonna be
I got high hopes for you niggas, we gon' see
I got money in the courts so all my niggas are free
Bout to call your ass a Uber, I got somewhere to be
I hear fairy tales ‘bout how they gon' run up on me
Well run up when you see me then and we gon' see

I got enemies, I got a lotta enemies
Got a lotta people tryna drain me of my energy
They tryna take the waaave from a nigga
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga

Naw, fuck all of you niggas I ain't finished
Y'all don't wanna hear me say it's a goal
Y'all don't wanna see Wayne win fifty awards
I got real ones livin' past Kennedy Road
I got real ones with me everywhere that I go
I'm tryna tell ya, I got enemies, got a lotta enemies
Every time I see ‘em somethin' wrong with they memory
Tryna take the wave from a nigga
So tired of savin' all these niggas, mayne!

I got enemies, I got a lotta enemies
Got a lotta people tryna drain me of my energy
They tryna take the waaave from a nigga
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga
