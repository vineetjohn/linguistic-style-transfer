It's dark in the day, and I'll say, now don't complain
Look up, the sun it's just a cloud away
You're so afraid to cry, but your heart be feeling dry
It's time to change
But you keep thundering thundering
I'm wondering wondering, why you keep thundering
Won't you just rain, and get it over with

When I'll feel the pain, now baby I won't complain
I'll hear you saying, look up the sun it's just a cloud away
And I was so afraid to cry
But when you need a way to ride, that's the way
You keep thundering thundering
I'm wondering wondering, why you keep thundering
Won't you just fucking rain and get it over with

And get it over with
I see you rolling in (in the clouds)
Let's get it over with
Get high and float again (in the clouds)
Roll up and go again
I see you rolling in (in the clouds)
Let's get it over with
Get high and float again (in the clouds)
Roll up and go again

It's alright we can roll in the clouds
Getting high we can float in the clouds
It's alright we can roll in the clouds
Getting high we can float in the clouds
It's alright we can roll in the clouds
Getting high we can float in the clouds

You keep thundering thundering
I'm wondering wondering, why you keep thundering
Won't you just fucking rain and get it over with
And get it over with
And get it over with

(It's alright we can roll in the clouds
Getting high we can float in the clouds)

We should be lighting up
We should be lighting up
We should be lighting up
Start it with lightning

It's dark in the day, and I'll say, now don't complain
Look up, the sun it's just a cloud away
