Hey, boy you never had much game
So I needed to upgrade
So I went and walked away-way-way
Now I seen you been hanging out
With that other girl in town
Looking like a pair of clowns-clowns-clowns

Remember all the things that you and I did first
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first
You got me got me like this
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
And everywhere we went, come on!
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
You got me got me like this

Boy you can say anything you wanna
I don't give a sh, no one else can have you
I want you back, I want you back
Want want you, want you back
I broke it off thinking you'd be crying
Now I feel like sh looking at you flying
I want you back, I want you back
Want want you, want you back

Please, this ain't even jealousy
She ain't got a thing on me
Tryna rock them ugly jeans-jeans-jeans
You clearly didn't think this through
If what I've been told is true
You'll be crawling back like boo-hoo-hoo

Remember all the things that you and I did first
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first
You got me got me like this like this

And now you're taking her to every restaurant
And everywhere we went, come on!
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
You got me got me like this

Boy you can say anything you wanna
I don't give a sh, no one else can have you
I want you back, I want you back
Want want you, want you back
I broke it off thinking you'd be crying
Now I feel like sh looking at you flying
I want you back, I want you back
Want want you, want you back

Oooh, oooh, I thought you'd still be mine
When I kissed you goodbye uh-oh uh-oh
Oooh, oooh, and you might be with her
But I still had you first uh-oh uh-oh

Remember all the things that you and I did first
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first, Yo!
