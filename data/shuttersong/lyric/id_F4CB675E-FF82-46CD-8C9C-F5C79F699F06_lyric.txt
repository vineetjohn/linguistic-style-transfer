You and I were meant to be

Ain't no doubt about it

No way to hide that sort of thing

Now I'm waiting for something better

Ain't nothing better worth imagining

I, I keep on running

I'm building bridges that

I know you never wanted

Look for my heart

You stole it away

Now on every single road that I could take

Listen, I want you to burn my bridges down

I said, I want you to burn my bridges down

Set me on Fire

You set me

Set me on Fire

You can burn my bridges down

Send this out to sea

Send it where you want it

You can take it note for note and not at all

There's no filling up

your spaces with fictionary places

Imaginary faces they don't work at all

I, I keep on running

I'm building bridges that

I know you never wanted

Look for my heart

You stole it away

Now on every single road that I could take

Listen, I want you to burn my bridges down

I said, I want you to burn my bridges down

Set me on Fire

You set me

Set me on Fire

Will you burn my bridges down?

I want you to burn my bridges down, down

I want you to burn my bridges down, yeah

Set me on fire

You set me

Set me on Fire

Set me on Fire

I want you to burn my bridges down

I said, I want you to burn

my bridges down

Down, Down

Set me on fire

Set me on fire
