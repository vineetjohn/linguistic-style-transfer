I've been looking for a driver who's qualified
So if you think that you're the one
Step into my ride

Speed machine
With a sunroof top and a gangster lean
So if you feel me let me know

Know, know

For, for
My engine's ready to explode

Explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go

Go, go, go
Got you where you wanna go

If you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine

Can you handle the curves?
Can you run all the lights?
If you can baby boy
Then we can go all night

'Cause I'm 0 to 60 in three point five
Baby you got the keys
Now shut up and drive
(Drive, drive, drive)

Shut up and drive
(Drive, drive, drive)
