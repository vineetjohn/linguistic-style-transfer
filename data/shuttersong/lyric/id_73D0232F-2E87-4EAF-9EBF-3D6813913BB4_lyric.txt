Imagine me and you, I do
I think about you day and night
It's only right
To think about the girl you love
And hold her tight
So happy together

If I should call you up, invest a dime
And you say you belong to me
And ease my mind
Imagine how the world could be
So very fine

So happy together

I can see me lovin' nobody but you for all my life
When you're with me, baby, the skies will be blue for all my life

Me and you, and you and me
No matter how they tossed the dice
It had to be

The only one for me is you
And you for me

So happy together

I can see me lovin' nobody but you for all my life
When you're with me, baby, the skies will be blue for all my life

Me and you and you and me
No matter how they tossed the dice
It had to be
The only one for me is you
And you for me
So happy together
Ba, ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba, ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Me and you and you and me
No matter how they tossed the dice
It had to be
The only one for me is you
And you for me
So happy together
So happy together
And how is the weather?
So happy together
We're happy together
So happy together
We're happy together
So happy together
So happy together
