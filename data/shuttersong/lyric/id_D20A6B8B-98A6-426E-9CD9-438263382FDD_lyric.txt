'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
Cause baby, now we've got bad blood (Hey!)

(Hey!) I can't take it back, look where I'm at
We was on D like DOC, remember that?
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq

I don't hate you but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No I don't fear no more, better yet respect ain't quite sincere no more

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood (Hey!)
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood (Hey!)

Remember when you tried to write me off?
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought I would need yah
Follow procedure, remember? Oh wait you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds, battle scars

Body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood (Hey!)

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
(You forgive, you forget but you never let it go)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!
