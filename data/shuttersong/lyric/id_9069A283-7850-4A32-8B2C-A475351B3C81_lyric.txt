Sometimes I think we're the brightest stars
And I try to believe we'll find a way
Will life change, will our hearts turn colder?
(Major Lazer)

All the rhythms in my heart lift me up inside
We can stay out of the trouble is it worth the blame?
Is it true that the more you give the more they take?
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say

[Pre-chorus:]
Only love will make us ache
Only love is worth the chase
All my love I know we're waitin' for this
On the rocks up on the mountain tops

[Chorus:]
All my love [3x]
Up on the mountain top

All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say
We're just a mess of broken people but we love the game
I would do anything for us, it's worth the pain
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus 2x]

You're always on my mind, oh there'll come a day
Day where we can fly, reach the glory haze
High up in the sun and a brighter sky, sun and a brighter sky

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
