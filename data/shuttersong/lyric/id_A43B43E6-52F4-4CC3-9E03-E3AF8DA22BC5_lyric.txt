[Chorus:]
I need your love, I need your love,
I need your lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love
I need your love, I need your love,
I need your...
I need your love, I need your love,
I need your lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love
Let me love you o-o-o...

[Verse:]
If I love ya love me right back
The kind of love that keep you comin' back
If I love ya love me right back
Don't ever leave me, girl, don't do me that
So please stay, don't walk away
Gimme another chance, mi love you the right way
My true feelings pushing on
Woman, you luv me, can't do without

[Verse 2:]
Who am I without you by my side?
Every little piece of my heart broken in the dark
Wishin' I could hold you now
When you were here for me
I was not there for you
I was too blind
Couldn't see what you did for me
Now I don't know what to do

[Bridge:]
Ladi ladi ram tam, ladi ladi ram tam
I'll be right here for you
Ladi ladi ram tam, ladi ladi ram tam
I'll be calling out for you, can you hear me?
(Toca toca latino!)

[Chorus:]
I need your love, I need your love,
I need your lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love
I need your love, I need your love,
I need your...
I need your love, I need your love,
I need your lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love
Let me love you o-o-o...
Let me love you o-o-o...

[Verse 3:]
And every time that you think to leave
I'll be don't don't don't don't go
And every time that you think of me
I'll want your big bright smile, just go
There's no-one else but you, girl
And when mi look at mi future, see you, girl
My true feelings pushing on
Woman, you luv me, can't do without

[Chorus:]
I need your love, I need your love,
I need your lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love
I need your love, I need your love,
I need your...
I need your love, I need your love,
I need your lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love
Let me love you o-o-o...

I need your love, I need your love,
I need your lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love
I need your love, I need your love,
I need your...
I need your love, I need your love,
I need your lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love
Let me love you o-o-o...
