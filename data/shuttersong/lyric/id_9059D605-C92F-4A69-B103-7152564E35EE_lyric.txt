I've been thinking 'bout you
Yeah, I've been missing you
Where the hell are you, oh, when I need you?
I could still hear your voice
I ain't got no choice, cause I'm here all alone
I know I can't wait 'til you get home

Oh, I don't have you here with me
But at least I have the memory
I tried to make it through the night
But I can't control my mind

I'm just thinkin' bout you
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you
I'm just thinkin' bout you
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you

Got these thoughts in my head
Ain't no way to forget
Got me losing my breath
Nobody got me the way that you did
Had my eyes rolling back
Had me arching my back
Now you love me so good
I wish you would hurry up and come back

Oh, I don't have you here with me
But at least I have the memory
I tried to make it through the night
But I can't control my mind

I'm just thinkin' bout you
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you, baby
I'm just thinkin' bout you
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you
I'm just thinkin' bout you
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you

Baby, I don't want no one, no one else
So hurry, cause I need some, need some, need some help
And I'll be waiting patient, patiently
Cause I don't have you here with, here with, here with me
But at least I have the memory
I'm just thinkin' bout you
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you
I'm just thinkin' bout you
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you
I'm just thinkin' bout you
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you
