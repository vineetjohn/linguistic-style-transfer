Angels Forever, Forever Angels - Lana Del Rey
Is the sun in your eyes, easy rider?
Do the flame colored skies light your fire?
We are heavy metal lions, they will never understand
The kind of people you or I am, bow your heads and take your hands
They were angels forever, forever angels
They were angels forever, forever angels
Does the ocean inspire, easy rider?
Do the stars and the wind take you higher?
You are California proud, you are angels of the night
Rock 'n' roll guardians now, the last keepers of the light
They were angels forever, forever angels
They were angels forever, forever angels
Paradise is a hell colored flame sky
Is it nice to feel free and wild?
Paradise is the game of do or die
I just ride, ride, ride
They were angels forever, forever angels
They were angels forever, forever angels
They were angels forever, forever angels
They were angels forever, forever angels
