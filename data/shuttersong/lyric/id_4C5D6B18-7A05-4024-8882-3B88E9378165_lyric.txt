All: If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your little white lies, little white lies

Liam: You say it's getting late, it's getting late
And you don't know if you can stay, if you can stay
But you, you don't tell the truth
No, you, you like playing games

Louis: Your hands touching me, they're touching me
And your eyes keep saying things
They're saying what we do
When it's only me and you

I can't concentrate
Niall: That's all I'm thinking about
All I keep thinking about

Everything else just fades away
All: If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind

With your little white lies, little white lies
You say you're a good girl
But I know you would, girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night
With your little white lies, little white lies

With your little white lies, little white lies
Zayn: Backseat of the cab, we're in the cab now
Lips getting so attached, they're so attached now
You wanna make some rules now

Cool, then we'll watch them break tonight
Niall: I know what you want

And I've been waiting so long
If this room was burning
All: I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind

With your little white lies, little white lies
You say you're a good girl
But I know you would, girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night
With your little white lies, little white lies

With your little white lies, little white lies
Zayn: I know you want it
I know you feel it too
Let's stop pretending
That you don't know what I don't know
Just what we came to do (what we came to do)
All: If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your little white lies, little white lies
You say you're a good girl
But I know you would girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night
With your little white lies, little white lies
With your little white lies, little white lies
