Baby, what are we becoming
It feels just like we're always running
Rollin' through the motions every day
I could lean in to hold you
Or act like I don't even know you
Seems like you could care less either way
What happened to that girl I used to know
I just want us back to the way we were before

Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy
Do I have your love, am I still enough
Tell me don't I, or tell me do I, baby

Give you everything that you ever wanted
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life
Baby, do I?

Remember when we didn't have nothin'
But a perfect, simple kind of lovin'
Baby, those sure were the days
There was a time our love ran wild and free
Now I'm second guessing everything I see

Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy
Do I have your love, am I still enough
Tell me don't I, or tell me do I, baby

Give you everything that you ever wanted
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life
Baby, do I
Still give you what you need
Still take your breath away
Light up a spark way down deep
Baby, do I?

Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy
Do I have your love, am I still enough
Tell me don't I, or tell me do I, baby
Give you everything that you ever wanted
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life
Tell me baby, do I get one more try
Do I?
Baby do I?
