Early morning take me over
Father, father, father
Take me to the top
Early morning wake me up
Father, father, father
This is not enough

Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh I love to be
I love to be the underdog
Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh I love to be
I love to be the underdog
Early evening settle down
Father, father, father

Who am I to blame?

Early evening hush me over
Father, father, father
Are we just the same?
Hey, that sounds like my luck

I get the short end of it
Oh I love to be

I love to be the underdog
Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh I love to be
I love to be the underdog
Living the low life
Low life...
Living the low life

Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh I love to be
I love to be the underdog
Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh I love to be
I love to be the underdog
