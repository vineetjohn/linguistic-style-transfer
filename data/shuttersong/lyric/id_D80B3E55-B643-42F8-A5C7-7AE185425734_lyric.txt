Stop fucking around with my emotions
I like you better when you're numb
I'm sick and tired of false devotion
Devote yourself to moving on
Or suck it up and let it go

But you're always out to get me

You're the snake hidden in my daffodils when I'm picking flowers
That's just my luck these days
Why can't you just be happy for me?
You're the break lines failing as my car swerves off the freeway
It kind of feels like sabotage
Why can't you just be happy for
Why can't you just be happy for me?

You think your opinions make you savy

Your running mouth falls on deaf ears
You say you're winning 'cause your laughing
Well I'm crying crocodile tears
Just suck it up and let it go
But you're always out to get me
You're the snake hidden in my daffodils when I'm picking flowers
That's just my luck these days
Why can't you just be happy for me?

You're the break lines failing as my car swerves off the freeway

It kind of feels like sabotage
Why can't you just be happy for
Why can't you just be happy for me?
(Why can't you just be happy for)
Why can't you just be happy for me?
(I'll never be good enough no, I'll never be good enough)
Why can't you just be happy for me?

(I'll never be good enough no, I'll never be good enough)

But you're always out to get me
You're the snake hidden in my daffodils when I'm picking flowers
That's just my luck these days
Why can't you just be happy for me?
You're the break lines failing as my car swerves off the freeway
It kind of feels like sabotage
Why can't you just be happy for
Why can't you just be happy for me?
