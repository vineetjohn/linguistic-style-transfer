Run away-ay with me
Lost souls and reverie
Running wild and running free
Two kids, you and me

And I say
Hey, hey hey hey
Living like we're renegades

Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Living like we're renegades
Renegades

Renegades
Long live the pioneers
Rebels and mutineers

Go forth and have no fear
Come close and lend an ear
And I say
Hey, hey hey hey

Living like we're renegades
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

Living like we're renegades
Renegades
Renegades
All hail the underdogs
All hail the new kids
All hail the outlaws
Spielbergs and Kubricks
It's our time to make a move
It's our time to make amends
It's our time to break the rules
Let's begin...
And I say
Hey, hey hey hey
Living like we're renegades
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Living like we're renegades
Renegades
Renegades
