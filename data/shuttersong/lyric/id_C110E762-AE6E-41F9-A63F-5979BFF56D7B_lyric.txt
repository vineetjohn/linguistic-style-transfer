I'm in love with a boy
I'm in love with a boy and I see him every day
I'm in love with a boy
But I'll never say his name
I'm in love with the way
I'm in love with his face, I can see right through
I'm in love with the way
The way I'm in love with you

It's just the way he moves
And, boy, do I approve
He's got that attitude that I dig
If he comes near and I am standing here
Do I just disappear?

I'm in love with a boy
I'm in love with a boy and I see him every day
I'm in love with a boy
But I'll never say his name
I'm in love with the way
I'm in love with his face, I can see right through
I'm in love with the way
The way I'm in love with you

It's just the way he speaks
And, boy, it makes me weak
He's got that confidence that I dig
If he comes near and I am standing here
Do I just disappear?

Maybe he don't like the clothes I wear
Maybe he don't like my hair
But I know that I'm better than good for him
Maybe he don't like my curvy ways
Or all the tricky games I play
But I know that I'm better than good for him

I'm in love with a boy
I'm in love with a boy and I see him every day
I'm in love with a boy
But I'll never say his name

It's just the way he moves
And, boy, do I approve
He's got that attitude that I dig
If he comes near and I am standing here
Do I just disappear?

I'm in love with a boy
I'm in love with a boy
I'm in love with a boy
But I'll never say his name
