Trippin' out
Spinnin' around
I'm underground, I fell down
Yeah, I fell down

I'm freakin' out
So where am I now?
Upside down
And I can't stop it now
It can't stop me now,
Ohhh

I, I'll get by
I, I'll survive
When the world's crashin' down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop it!
I, I won't cry

I found myself (myself) in Wonderland
Get back on my feet again
Is this real? (Is this real?)
Is it pretend? (Is it pretend?)
I'll take (I'll take) a stand (A stand) until (Until) the end

I, I'll get by
I, I'll survive
When the world's crashin' down
When I fall and hit the ground
I'll just turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me!
I, I won't cry

I, I'll get by
I, I'll survive
When the world's crashin' down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me!
I, and I won't cry
