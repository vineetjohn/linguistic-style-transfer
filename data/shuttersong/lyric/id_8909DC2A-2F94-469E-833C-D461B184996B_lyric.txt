Putting my defenses up
Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
Never put my love out on the line

Never said yes to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you I'm never good enough
When I don't care
I can play him like a Ken doll
Won't wash my hair
Then make 'em bounce like a basketball
But you make me wanna act like a girl

Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yes you, make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show

So I'm putting my defenses up
Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
Never break a sweat for the other guys
When you come around I get paralyzed
And every time I try to be myself

It comes out wrong like a cry for help
It's just not fair
Pain's more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air
It feels so good, but you know it hurts
But you, make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume
For you make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
Cause I don't wanna fall in love

If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack!
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
The feelings got lost in my lungs
They're burning, I'd rather be numb
And, yeah, there's no one else to blame
So scared I take off and run
I'm flying too close to the sun

And I burst into flames
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
Heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack - tack
Oh I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
