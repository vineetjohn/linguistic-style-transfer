I'm... I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is all right with me...
'Cause you... make me feel so brand new...
And I... want to spend my life with you...

Let me say that since, baby
Since we've been together
Ooo...
Loving you forever
Is what I... need...
Let me... be the one you come running to...
I'll... never be untrue...

Ooo baby...
Let's, let's stay together...
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
Ooooo... Oooo... Yeah...
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad

Why, somebody, why people break-up
Ohhh, turn around and make-up
I just can't deceive
You'd... never do that to me... (would you, baby?)
Stayin' around you is all I see

(Here's what I want us to do)

Let's, we oughta stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad... Come on
Let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
