Here I am again in this mean old town
And you're so far away from me
And where are you when the sun go down?
You're so far away from me

You're so far away from me
So far I just can't see
You're so far away from me
You're so far away from me, alright
I'm tired of bein' in love and bein' all alone

When you're so far away from me
I'm tired of makin' out on the telephone
'Cause you're so far away from me
You're so far away from me

You're so far I just can't see
You're so far away from me
You're so far away from me, alright
And I get so tired when I have to explain
When you're so far away from me

See you've been in the sun and I've been in the rain
And you're so far away from me
You're so far away from me
You're so far I just can't see

You're so far away from me
You're so far away from me, take it down
So far away from me
Oh, you're so far away from me
Yeah, you're so far away from me

So far away from me
And you're so far away from me
So far away from me
So far away from me
You're so far away from me
You're so far away from me
So far away from me
So far away from me
You're so far away from me
Alright
You're just so far away from me
