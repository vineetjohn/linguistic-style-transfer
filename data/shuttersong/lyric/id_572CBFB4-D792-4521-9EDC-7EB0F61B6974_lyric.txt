Hush now child and don't you cry
Your folks might understand you by and by
So in the mean time, move on up towards your destination
Though you may find from time to time complications

Bite your lip and take a trip
Though there may be wet road ahead
And you cannot slip so what you wanna do
Just move on up for peace you will find
Into the steeple of beautiful people where there's only one kind

So hush now child and don't you cry
Your folks might understand you by and by
So what are we wanna do is move on up for a greater day
But just you gonna make it, you put your mind to it, you can surely do it

Take nothing less than the supreme best
Do not obey for most people say 'cause you can past the test
So what we have to do is move on up and keep on wishing
Remember your dream is your only scheme so keep on pushing

So hush now child and don't you cry
Your folks might understand you by and by
Move on up for a greater day but just you gonna make it
You put your mind to it, you can surely do it
Move on up, we can to move on up
Move on up, move on child I wanna move on up

We can to move on up, we can to move on up
We can to move on up, we can to move on up
