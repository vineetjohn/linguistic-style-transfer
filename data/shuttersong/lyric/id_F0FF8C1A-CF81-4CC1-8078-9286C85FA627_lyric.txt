Really Love - D'Angelo /The Vanguards
When you call my name
When you love me gently
When you're walking near me
Doo doo wah I'm in really love with you 
I'm in really love with you
When you look at me
I open up instantly
I fall in love so quickly
Doo doo wah I'm in really love with you 
Doo doo wah I'm in really love with you
I'm in really love with you
All night beside you I'd lay
I love you deep when you come to my bed
Doo doo wah  I'm in really love with you
I'm in really love with you
Ooh wah  I'm in really love with you
When you touch me there
When you make me tingle
When our nectars mingle
Doo doo wah  I'm in really love with you
I'm in really love
I'm not an easy man  to overstand  you feel me
But girl your patient with me
Doo doo wah  I'm in really love with you 
I'm in really love with you
All night I wish for you here
Lay your head beside my hip
Doo doo wah  I'm in really love with you
I'm in really love with you
Doo doo wah  I'm in really love with you
Doo doo wah  I'm in really love with you
I'm in really love with you
Oh how I love the little things you do
I'm in really love with you
