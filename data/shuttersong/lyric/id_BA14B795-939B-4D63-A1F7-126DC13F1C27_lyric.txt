I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming

I'm back where I belong, yeah I never felt so strong (yeah)
(I'm back baby)
I feel like there's nothing that I can't try
And if you with me put your hands high (put your hands high)
If you ever lost a life before (high, hands),
This one's for you
(and if you with me put your hands high, hands, high)
And you, and you, and you, and you
(your dreams are filled, you're rapping with the best)
I'll be home soon

I hear "The Tears of a Clown"
I hate that song
I always feel like they talking to me when it comes on (come on)
Another day another dawn
Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math I'm gone
What am I 'posed to do when the club lights come on
It's easy to be Puff, but it's harder to be Sean
What if the twins ask why I ain't marry their mom (why, damn!)
How do I respond?
What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown
Shit, but I ain't finished growing
Another night the inevitable prolongs
Another day another dawn (come on)
Just tell Keisha and Taresha I'll be better in the morn'
Another lie that I carry on
I need to get back to the place I belong

[Dirty Money - Chorus]
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming... home

[Diddy]
"A house is Not a Home", I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones is gone
And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it (come on)
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it (that's right)
But you felt it and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it and you keep ballin' (that's right)
Pour out some liquor, play ball and we keep ballin'
Baby we've been living in sin 'cause we've been really in love
But we've been living as friends (yeah)
So you've been a guest in your own home (come on)
It's time to make your house your own
Pick up the phone, come on

[Dirty Money - Chorus]
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming... home

[Diddy]
"Ain't No Stopping Us Now", I love that song
Whenever it comes on it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
We back cruising through Harlem, these ol' blocks
It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away then embraced me
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings
Welcome to my homecoming
Yeah, it's been a long time coming
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles
Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog (I miss you BIG)
But here I stand (here I stand), a better man! (a better man)
Thank you Lord (Thank you Lord)
Thank you all!

[Dirty Money - Chorus]
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming... home
