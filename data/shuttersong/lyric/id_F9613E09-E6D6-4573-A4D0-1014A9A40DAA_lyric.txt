It's been so long
That I haven't seen your face
I'm trying to be strong
But the strength I have is washing away

It won't be long
Before I get you by my side
And just hold you, tease you, squeeze you
Tell you what's been on my mind

I wanna make up right now
I wanna make up right now
Wish we never broke up right now
We need to link up right now

I wanna make up right now, na, na
I wanna make up right now, na, na
Wish we never broke up right now, na, na
We need to link up right now, na, na

Girl, I know mistakes were made between us two
And we show our eyes that night
Even said some things weren't true

Why'd you go and haven't seen my girl since then
Why can't it be the way it was?
'Cause you were my homie, lover and friend

I wanna make up right now
I wanna make up right now
Wish we never broke up right now
We need to link up right now

I wanna make up right now, na, na
I wanna make up right now, na, na
Wish we never broke up right now, na, na
We need to link up right now, na, na

I can't lie, I miss you much
Watching everyday that goes by, I miss you much
Until I get you back I'm gonna try, yes, I miss you much
'Cause you are the apple of my eye, girl, I miss you much

I miss you much I can't lie, I miss you much
Watching everyday that goes by, I miss you much
Until I get you back I'm gonna try, yes, I miss you much
'Cause you are the apple of my eye, girl, I miss you much

I miss you much, I wanna make up right now
I wanna make up right now
Wish we never broke up right now
We need to link up right now

I wanna make up right now, na, na
I wanna make up right now, na, na
Wish we never broke up right now, na, na
We need to link up right now, na, na

I want you to fly with me, want you to fly
I miss how you lie with me, oh, I miss how you lie
Just wish you could dine with me, wish you could dine
One that would grind with me, oh, one that would grind

I want you to fly with me, want you to fly
I miss how you lie with me, I miss how you lie
Just wish you could dine with me, wish you could dine
One that would grind with me, one that would grind
I wanna make up right now
I wanna make up right now
Wish we never broke up right now
We need to link up right now
I wanna make up right now, na, na
I wanna make up right now, na, na
Wish we never broke up right now, na, na
We need to link up right now, na, na
I wanna make up right now, na, na
