Sleeplessly embracing
Butterflies and needles
Line my seamed-up join
Encased in case I need it
In my stomach, for my heart
Chain mail

Hunger of the Pine
Hunger of the pine

Sleeplessly embracing
Yawn yearns into me
Plenty more tears in the sea
And so you finally use it
Bedding with me you see at night
Your heart wears knight armour

Hunger of the pine
(I'm a female rebel)

(I'm a female rebel)

(I'm a female rebel)
(I'm a female rebel... female Rebel)
Sleeplessly

Embracing
You
Realization grew on me
As quickly as it takes your hand
To warm the cold side of the pillow
I'm there for you, be there for me
I'll hum the song the soldiers sing

As they march outside our window
Hunger of the pine
Sleeplessly
Embracing
Sleeplessly

Embracing
You
(I'm a female rebel)
Sleeplessly
Embracing
(I'm a female rebel)
Sleeplessly
Embracing
You
(I'm a female rebel)
