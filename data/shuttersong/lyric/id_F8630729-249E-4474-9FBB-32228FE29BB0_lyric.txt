People say whe shouldn't be together
We're too young, to know about forever
But I say, they don't know what they're talk-talk-talking about (Talk-talk-talking about)

'Cause this love is only getting stronger
So I don't wanna wait any longer
I just wanna tell the world that you're mine girl

Oh, they don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the, "I love you's"
But I bet you, if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us
They don't know about the up all nights
They don't know I've waited all my life,
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us

One touch, and I was a believer
Every kiss, it gets a litlle sweeter
It's getting better, keeps getting better al the time, girl

They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the, "I love you's"
But I bet you, if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us
They don't know about the up all nights
They don't know I've waited all my life,
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us

They don't know how special you are
They don't know what you've done to my heart
They can say anything they want, cause they don't know about us

They don't know what we do best,
Thats between me and you, our little secrets

But I wanna tell 'em,
I wannt tell the world that you're mine, girl

They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the, "I love you's"
But I bet you if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us
They don't know about the up all nights
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a girl that feels this right

Baby, they don't know about,

They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the, "I love you's"
But I bet you if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us
They don't know about the up all nights
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right

Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us
They don't know about us
