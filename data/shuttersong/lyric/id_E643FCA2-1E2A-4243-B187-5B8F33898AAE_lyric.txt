So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trust in who we are
And nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words, I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never care for what they do
Never care for what they know
And I know

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never care for what they do
Never care for what they know
And I know, yeah

I never opened myself this way

Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words, I don't just say
And nothing else matters
Trust I seek and I find in you

Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters
Never care for what they say
Never care for games they play
Never care for what they do
Never care for what they know
And I know, ooh, yeah
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trust in who we are
No, nothing else matters
