[Hook: Bruno Mars]
So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We¡¯re just having fun
We don¡¯t care who sees
So what we go out?
That¡¯s how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
So what I keep ¡®em rolled up?
Saggin¡¯ my pants, not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for these hoes
And look clean don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong¡¯s fingers
And smoke them hoes down ¡¯til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I¡¯m with your bitch smokin¡¯ grade A

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
You know what?
It¡¯s like I¡¯m 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin¡¯, on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh my god, I¡¯m on the chase, Chevy
It's gettin¡¯ kinda heavy, relevant, sellin¡¯ it
Dippin¡¯ away, time keeps slippin¡¯ away
Zip in the safe, flippin¡¯ for pay
Tippin¡¯ like I¡¯m drippin¡¯ in paint
Up front, four blunts, like, ¡°Khalifa put the weed in a J¡±

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
And I don't even care
Cause if me and my team in there
There's gonna be some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up

[Wiz Khalifa]
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up

[Snoop Dogg]
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang

[Wiz Khalifa]
Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it

[Snoop Dogg]
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, high as me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life

[Hook]

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Yea, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you¡¯re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you¡¯re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun

[Hook]
