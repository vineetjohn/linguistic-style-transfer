Between love and hate I am the ruler
I am the time and space
That hell has spawned between us
Behind this door there hides much more

Between fear and fate there are questions
There is a right and wrong
In every search for answers
So tell me why
The voice of desire it follows me

Hear the call of the wave
An age where lives will change
In the hour of certainty
Is it what we expect to be?
You will find peace you will find truth
In the Age of Aquarius

In a circle of fire
A fate of a nation is sealed
An act of desire
Born into something unseen and unknown
The sands from the East will blow West
And silence the halls

Hear the call of the wave
An age where lives will change
In the hour of certainty
Is it what we expect to be?
We find not peace, we find not truth
In the Age of Aquarius

I was told across the border of consequence
The warm winds blow to the boundaries of faith
A river flows, but I will remain to be standing still
Transcending dreams, now I’m drowning inside

Lost in the stars
That we depend to guide us on
Left in the cold
The darkest winters follow on
Seasons will change
So can I now with the world
We can all learn from a past once known
