I've walked through the valleys of the wilderness in time
Only to find out that you have love in places I can't describe
I need you, it's the sunrise
I just wanted to let you know
I love you, don't ever let go
'Cause the sun don't shine
When you're not around mine
Singing I can never be without you
Singing the sun don't shine
The sun don't shine
The sun don't shine
The sun don't shine
Without you, without you
Through all the space and time
Your love is mine
But the sun don't shine
The sun don't shine
Without you, without you
When I saw you rise the other day
I felt my worries just seemed to melt away
Into you, yeah, into you
I just wanted to let you know
I love you, don't ever let go
'Cause the sun don't shine
When you're not around mine,
Singing I can never be without you
Yeah
Singing the sun don't shine
The sun don't shine
The sun don't shine
The sun don't shine
Without you, without you
Through all the space and time
Your love is mine
But the sun don't shine
The sun don't shine
Without you, without you
Yeah
