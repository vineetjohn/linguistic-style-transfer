You've got to change your evil ways baby
Before I stop lovin' you
You've got to change baby
And every word that I say is true
You've got me runnin' and hidin' all over town
You've got me sneakin' and a peepin' and runnin' you down
This can't go on...
Lord knows you've got to change baby
Baby
When I come home baby
My house is dark and my thoughts are cold
You hang around baby
With Jean and Joan and a who knows who
I'm gettin' tired of waiting and fooling around
I'll find somebody that won't make me feel like a clown
This can't go on...
Lord knows you've got to change
Hi ya
When I come home baby
My house is dark and my thoughts are cold
You hang around baby
With Jean and Joan and a who knows who
I'm gettin' tired of waiting and fooling around
I'll find somebody that won't me feel like a clown
This can't go on...
Yeah yeah yeah...
Look out look out look out look out look out look out look out look out look out
