I can taste salt water
And if I blink again
You'll be sinking in
So we'll learn to swim in the oceans you made
I hold you and you think of him
And pretty soon you'll be floating away

And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I'm captain of this sinking boat, now
With just one armband to carry me home

When salted tears won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes

I still taste salt water
On my lips from your kiss: bitterness
And I drown within the ocean you made
And I hate to love you, these cuffs covered in your make up
I'll never trust you again
You can just be a friend

And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I'm captain of this sinking boat, now
With just one armband to carry me home

When salted tears won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes

Your eyes, your lips, your mouth
Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild
Tonight, the fact design
I'm on my way home
On the way home
I lied, I tried to cry but I'm

I'm drowning in the ocean you made
When salted tears won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
