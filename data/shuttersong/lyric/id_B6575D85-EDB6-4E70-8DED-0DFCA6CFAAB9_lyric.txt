I've been sleepless at night
Cause I don't know how I feel
I've been waiting on you
Just to say something real

There's a light on the road
And I think you know
Morning has come and I have to go

I don't know why, I don't know why
We need to break so hard
I don't know why we break so hard

But if we're strong enough to let it in
We're strong enough to let it go

Let it all go, let it all go, let it all out now

If I look back to the start

Now I know, I see everything true
There's still a fire in my heart, my darling
But I'm not burning for you

We started it wrong and I think you know
We waited too long, now I have to go

I don't know why, I don't know why
We need to break so hard
I don't know why we break so hard
But if we're strong enough to let it in
We're strong enough to let it go
Let it all go, let it all go, let it all out now
Who says, who says
Who says, who says
Who says truth is beauty after all
And who says love should break us when we fall
But if we're strong enough to let it in
We're strong enough to let it go
Let it all go, let it all go, let it all out now
Let it all go, let it all go, let it all out now
We're strong enough to let it go
