Hard to find a way to get through
It's a tragedy
Pulling at me like the stars do
You're like gravity
Even if the wind blows
It makes it hard to believe

How you gonna love
How you gonna feel
How you gonna live your life like the dream you have is real
And if you lost your way
I will keep you safe
We'll open up all the world inside
I see it come alive tonight
I will keep you safe

Doesn't even matter to you
To see what I can see
I'm crawling on the floor to reach you
I'm a wreck you see
When you're far from home now
Makes it hard to believe

So how you gonna love
How you gonna feel
How you gonna live your life like the dream you have is real
If you've lost your way
I will keep you safe
We'll open up all your world inside
Till you come alive tonight
I will keep you safe

We all fall down
We all feel down
Cause rainy days and summer highs
The more we pray the more we feel alive

How you gonna love
How you gonna feel
How you gonna live your life like the dream you have is real
How you gonna love
How you gonna feel
How you gonna live your life like the dream you have is real

If you've lost your way
I will keep you safe
We'll open up all your world inside
So you come alive tonight
I will keep you safe
I will keep you safe
I will keep you safe
