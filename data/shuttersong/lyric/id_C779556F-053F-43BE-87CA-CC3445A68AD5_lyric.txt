Lights out, TKO
Baby, everyday in training to get the gold
That's why your body's crazy
But you can't run from yourself, that's where it's difficult
Girl I can see in your eyes that there's something inside that made you evil
Where did you go, 'cause it just ain't fair

Over here thinking 'bout the shit you say

Don't know why it gets to me
It cuts right on my eye, yeah it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy

Terrified, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out

What am I supposed to do?
I don't understand it
Tell me how could you be so low

Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit 'til the dawn, dammit babe
This ain't the girl I used to know

No, not anymore, TKO
I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out

Baby, now I really know what we're fighting for

This rematch sex is amazing
But nobody wins when if somebody's heart is slow
‘Cause when I see you move like you got something inside that made you lethal
Where did you go, ‘it just ain't fair
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you do

Don't know what I got to lose
It cuts right on my eye, yeah it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Terrified, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out

What am I supposed to do?
