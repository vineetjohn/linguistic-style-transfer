Adore - Cashmere Cat Ariana Grande
Boy  so what's been on your mind 
For me  it's just you all the time
We don't need to go nowhere tonight
It's you and I  we'll be alright
Cause here  we get to take our time
You  you're finer than some wine
We don't need to go nowhere tonight
It's you and I  we'll be alright
I'll give you everything
I'll give you everything
You don't owe me anything
So when you're ready  baby
You got me screaming
My my my ma-ma my my
You got me screaming
My my my ma-ma my my
And then I'm like  oh  your love
My my my my my
And then I'm like  oh  yeah yeah
Cause you're what I adore
After that  when you catch your breath
You look at me and say
Love  are you real 
Just don't pretend you're just a friend
I'll give you everything
I'll give you everything
You don't owe me anything
So when you're ready  baby
You got me screaming
