If, all I could say is if
Promise me you won't regret me like the tattoos on my skin
Like the wrong kind
Promise me you'll all love me one day you'll remember me
When you fuck them you'll see my face.
My body is yours
Happy Thursday

It seems like pain and regret
Are your best friends
Ooh, oh yeah
'Cause everything you do leads to them
Right, right, right
Yeah, but, baby, I could be your best friend
Ooh
Baby, I could fuck you right ooh
Whoah

Baby, you can have it all
Ooh whoah
Baby, you can have it all
Ooh yeah
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes
The jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star, oh yeah

Baby, you can have it all
Baby, you can have it all
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes
The jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star

Woah
You're blaming all your sins
On your best friends ooh, oh yeah

And nothing's ever ever your fault

Nothing's your fault, baby, no

But baby, you don't need
Your best friends woah woah woah yeah

If, all I could say is if
Promise me you won't regret me like the tattoos on my skin
Let the wrong doing come with me
One day I'm hoping that you will remember me
When you fuck them you'll see my face
My body is yours

Give them any other day but Thursday
You belong to me every Thursday
I wait for you
I'll be beautiful for you
Every Thursday
I exist only on Thursday
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
But on Thursday, Thursday
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
But on Thursday
I love the guitars
