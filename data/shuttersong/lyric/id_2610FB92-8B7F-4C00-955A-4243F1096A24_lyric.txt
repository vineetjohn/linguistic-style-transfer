When December comes, I bet you want to
Wrap me all up and take me home with you
See what I look like under them lights
We'll keep it quiet, whatever we do

I'm just tryna keep my baby warm through the wintertime
I'm just tryna give you something to remember through the summertime
And whatever is on your list, I'll do it
Boy, whatever it is, you know I'll do it

Merry Christmas, here I am, boy
Gonna love you, gonna give you all I can, boy
Merry Christmas, here I am, boy
I'm the present and you know it, here I am, boy
Merry Christmas, here I am, boy
Gonna love you, gonna give you all I can, boy
Merry Christmas, here I am, boy
I'm the present and you know it, boy

I'll give you the fire I keep inside
Guide you all the way down, be your nightlight
Give you the sweetest kiss that you'll taste
Unwrap me now, been waiting since midnight

I'm just tryna keep my baby warm through the wintertime
I'm just tryna give you something to remember through the summertime
And whatever is on your list, I'll do it
Boy, whatever it is, you know I'll do it

Merry Christmas, here I am, boy
Gonna love you, gonna give you all I can, boy
Merry Christmas, here I am, boy
I'm the present and you know it, here I am, boy
Merry Christmas, here I am, boy
Gonna love you, gonna give you all I can, boy
Merry Christmas, here I am, boy
I'm the present and you know it, here I am, boy
