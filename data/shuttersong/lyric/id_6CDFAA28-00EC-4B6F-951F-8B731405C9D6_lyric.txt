Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks

Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside

Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside

Guess who's back

Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back

I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give you

A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital

By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating
You waited this long, now stop debating

'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty, without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
fuck that, cum on your lips, and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy

I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you Debbie
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
