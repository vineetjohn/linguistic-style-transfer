I know I took the path 
That you would never want for me
I know I let you down, did'n I?
So many sleepless nights,
Where you were waiting up on me
Well I'm just a slave unto the night
Now remember when I told you
That's the last you'll see of me?
Remember when I broke you down to tears?
I knew I took the path
That you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years


So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life for you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life for you
 


I've been around the world
And never in my wildest dreams
Would I come running home to you
I've told a million lies, but
Now I tell a single truth
There's you in everything I do
Now remember when I told you
That's the last you'll see of me?
Remember when I broke you down to tears?
I knew I took the path
That you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years


So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life for you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life for you



Don't tell me that I'm wrong
I've walked that road before
And left you on your own
And please, believe them when they say
That it's left for yesterday
And the records that I play
Please forgive me for all I've done



So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life for you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life for you
