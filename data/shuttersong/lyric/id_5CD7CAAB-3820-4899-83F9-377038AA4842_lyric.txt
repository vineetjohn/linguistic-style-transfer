I said drink from me, drink from me
(Oh-ah-oh-ah)
Let me shoot across the sky
Symphony
Let me shoot across the sky
We're on a...
Drink from me, drink from me
(Oh-ah-oh-ah)
Let me shoot across the sky
Symphony
(So high, so high)
Let me shoot across the sky

Oh, angels sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink, and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was hurt, withered, dried up
You came to rain a flood

I said, drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
We're on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
We're on a symphony
When I'm lower, lower, lower, low

Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
(Woo)
(Woo-ooo-ooo-woo)

Oh, angels sent from up above
I feel it coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the stars come out

Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
We're on a symphony
When I'm lower, lower, lower, low

Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
So high, so high
Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

Let me shoot across the sky
Let me shoot across the...
Let me shoot across the sky
Let me shoot across the...
Let me shoot across the sky
Let me shoot across the...
Let me shoot across the sky
Let me shoot across the...
