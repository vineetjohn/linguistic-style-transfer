I should ink my skin
with your name
take my passport out again
just replace it
See I could do without a tan
On my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath

fill it up with bubbles
'Cause maybe you're loveable
Maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray
In the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair

'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder, mm
you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love

When you wake me up
And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
Would you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek
Because we've watched it 12 times
But maybe you're hoping for a fairytale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR

Because I've never owned a blue ray, true say
Now I've always been shit at computer games
and your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you'd lie with me till I fall asleep

And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love

When you wake me up
And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always trying to get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like a necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
And now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
'Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up
