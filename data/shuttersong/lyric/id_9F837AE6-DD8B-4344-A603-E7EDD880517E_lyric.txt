Girl, I'm ready, if you're ready, now
Ooh, is it ever gonna be?
If you're with it, then I'm with it, now
To accept all responsibility
I'd go out of my way
To live by the words that you say
I don't wanna be the same

Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could be the light
That opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right
Change me, change me

Don't fight fire with fire
If I'm screaming, talk quiter
Understanding and patience
Feel the pain that I'm facing
Be like Serenity
Help me position my mind

Take a chance
Make a difference in my life
Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could be the light
That opens up my eyes

Make all my wrongs right
Change me, change me
Girl, I'm ready, if you're ready, now
Ooh, is it ever gonna be?
If you're with it, then I'm with it, now
