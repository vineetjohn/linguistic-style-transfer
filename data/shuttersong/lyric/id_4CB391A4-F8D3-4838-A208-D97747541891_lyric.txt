INSTRUMENTAL
Don't want you back
Don't get surreal
Two shots and the chances stop and see you're up to nothing
(Go)
Why don't you go?
Tell me what we could've been if we see you're up to something?

What if we could have met then it maybe?
What if you turn you were just shady?
What if we found you will just say no?

Do you believe that love was impossible?
Do you conceive that we were not probable?
Do you suppose that we supposed to be in love?

Baby you can let me down
But if you break my heart we still come round
Baby you treat me bad
But I still say to my friends you were the best I had
Baby you can let me down
But if you break my heart we still come round

Do you wanna try?
Do you wanna cry?
Do you wanna... stop

Don't wanna bring you down
But don't you feel?
Our love was a chance to stop while the front that you were some friend
(From)
Don't take it slow
Tell me what we could've been if I let you keep on rushing?

What if we could have met then it maybe?
What if you turn you were just shady?
What if we found you will just say no?

Do you believe that love was impossible?
Do you conceive that we were not probable?
Do you suppose that we supposed to be in love?

Baby you can let me down
But if you break my heart we still come round
Baby you treat me bad
But I still say to my friends you were the best I had
Baby you can let me down
But if you break my heart we still come round

Do you wanna try?
Do you wanna cry?
Do you wanna... stop
