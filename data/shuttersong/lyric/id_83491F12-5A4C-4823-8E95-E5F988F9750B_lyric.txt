May I have your attention, please
May I have your attention, please
Will the real Slim Shady, please stand up

I repeat, will the real Slim Shady, please stand up
We're gonna have a problem here
Ya'll act like you never seen, a white person before
Jaws all on the floor, like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass, worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Ahh)
It's the return of the, oh wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say, what I think he did, did he
And Dr. Dre said... nothing you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Haha)
Feminist women love Eminem
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you know what
Flippin' to you know who, yeah but he's so cute though
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's goin' on in your parents bedrooms (Eh-eh-eh)
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green, to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky you might, just give it a little kiss
And that's the message, that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know, what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade, they got the Discovery Channel don't they
We ain't nothin' but mammals, well some of us are cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes

Then there's no reason that a man, and another man can't elope (Eww)

But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the and it goes
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating

So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up
don't gotta cuss in his raps, to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird
Why, so you guys can just lie to get me here
So you can, sit me here next to
Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs so
I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over, who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast, on MTV
Yeah he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hehe

I should download her audio, on MP3
And show the whole world, how you gave Eminem VD (Ahh)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me

So I have been sent here, to destroy you

And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk talk and act like me
And just might be, the next best thing, but not quite me
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up
I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends, inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it, in front of ya'll

And I don't gotta be false, or sugar-coat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, [(Rip)] I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can

Then you wonder how can kids, eat up these albums like Valiums it's funny
'Cause at the rate I'm goin', when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person, in the nursin' home flirting

Pinchin' nurses asses, while I'm jackin' off with Jergens

And I'm jerkin', but this whole bag of Viagra isn't workin'
In every single person there's a Slim Shady lurkin'

Who could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parkin' lot circling, screamin' I don't give a fuck

With his windows down, and his system up

So will the real Shady, please stand up
And put one of those fingers, on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind, and outta control

And one more time loud as you can, how's it go?
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up
Haha, guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up
