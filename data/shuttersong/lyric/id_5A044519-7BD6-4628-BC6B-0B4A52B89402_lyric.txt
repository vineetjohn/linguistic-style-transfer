Rise above, gonna start the war!
What you want, what you need, what'd you come here for?
Well, an eye for an eye and an 'F' for fight
They're taking me down as the prisoners riot

Got shackles on, my words are tied
Fear can make you compromise
Lights turned up, it's hard to hide
Sometimes I wanna disappear

When I feel kinda bad and don't want to stress
I just pass it off on ability
Well, you got what you want, and what you never knew
Perfect gift from me to you

Got shackles on, my words are tied
Fear can make you compromise
With the lights turned up, it's hard to hide
Sometimes I wanna disappear

(Raise up to your ability)
You never knew what I could find
What would come when we realize
I don't want to compromise

(Raise up to your ability)
Yeah I'm scared but I disappear
Running around before it corners you
I can't go because my life's a wreck

(Raise up to your ability)
I know that you want me
'Cause it's simple to see of my ability

(Raise up to your ability)
Yeah you're undecided
Yeah so I can see that
Yeah I don't wanna runaway

You gotta focus on your ability
Focus on your ability
Gotta focus on your ability
Focus on your ability

Can't get what they want to steal
Can't get what they want to steal
Then they can't get what they want to steal
Can't get what they want to steal
