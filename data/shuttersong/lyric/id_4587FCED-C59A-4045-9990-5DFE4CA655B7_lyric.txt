So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face
If a great wave shall fall
And would fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?

If I could, then I would
I'm going wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'm going wherever you will go

And maybe, I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days
If a great wave shall fall
And would fall upon us all
Well I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you

If I could, then I would
I'm going wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'm going wherever you will go

Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind

I'll stay with you for all my time
If I could, then I would
I'm going wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'm going wherever you will go
If I could turn back time
I'm going wherever you will go
If I could make you mine
I'm going wherever you will go
I'm going wherever you will go
