In my eyes
Indisposed
In disguises no one knows
Hides the face
Lies the snake
And the sun in my disgrace
Boiling heat
Summer stench
'Neath the black, the sky looks dead
Call my name
Through the cream
And I'll hear you scream again

Black hole sun
Won't you come
Wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come
Won't you come?

Stuttering
Cold and damp
Steal the warm wind, tired friend
Times are gone
For honest men
Sometimes, far too long for snakes
In my shoes
Walking sleep
In my youth, I pray to keep
Heaven send
Hell away
No one sings like you anymore

Black hole sun
Won't you come

And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come?

Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come? (Black hole sun, black hole sun)

Hang my head
Drown my fear
Till you all just disappear
Black hole sun
Won't you come

And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
(Won't you come) (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
(Won't you come) (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
(Won't you come) (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come
Won't you come?
