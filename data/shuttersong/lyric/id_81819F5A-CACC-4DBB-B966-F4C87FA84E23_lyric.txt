Let's drop!
Yeah, come on

Shake, shake
I'll take you home
If you don't leave me at the front door

(Leave me at the front door)

Your body's cold

But girl, we're getting so warm

And I was thinking of ways that I could get inside
(Get inside)

Tonight you're falling in love
(Let me go now)
This feeling's tearing me up
(Here we go now)
Now, if she does it like this
Will you do it like that?
Now, if she touches like this
Will you touch her right back?
Now, if she moves like this
Will you move like that?
Come on
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
Your lips tremble
But your eye's are in a straight stare
(In a straight stare)
We're on the bed
But your clothes are laying right there
And I was thinking of places that I could hide
(I could hide)
Tonight you're falling in love
(Let me go now)
This feeling's tearing me up
(Here we go now)
Now, if she does it like this
Will you do it like that?
Now, if she touches like this
Will you touch her right back?
Now, if she moves like this
Will you move like that?
Come on
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
I saw you dancing there
I couldn't get you off my mind
But I could tell, that you could tell
That I was taking my time
But I was thinking of ways
To get you staying the night
Your body's shaking
Turn me on, so I can turn off the lights
Now, if she does it like this
Will you do it like that?
Now, if she touches like this
Will you touch her right back?
Now, if she moves like this
Will you move like that?
Come on
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
(Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it) x3
