Lay beside me and tell me what they've done
And speak the words I wanna hear to make my demons run
The door is locked now but it's open if you're true
If you can understand the me then I can understand on you
Lay beside me, under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night, we share this paralize
The door cracks open but there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still but there's no sun shining through

No there's no sun shining through, no there's no sun shining
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there
'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

Come lay beside me, this won't hurt I swear

She loves me not, she loves me still but she'll never love again

She lay beside me but she'll be there when I'm gone
Black hearts scarring darker still, yes she'll be there when I'm gone
Yes she'll be there when I'm gone, dead sure she'll be there
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there

'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

Lay beside me, tell me what I've done

The door is closed so are your eyes
But now I see the sun, now I see the sun

Yes now I see it
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone

Behind the door, should I open it for you
Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
So sick and tired, I stand alone

Could you be there
'Cause I'm the one who waits

The one who waits for you
Oh, what I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
So I dub thee unforgiven
Oh, what I've felt
Oh, what I've known
I'll take this key and I'll bury it in you
Because you're unforgiven too
Never free, never me
Because you're unforgiven too
