 I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change  I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
Yeah,  I,  I know it's hard  to remember
The people we used  to be
It's even harder  to picture
That you're not here next  to me
You say it's too late  to make it
But is it too late  to  try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
 I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now  I 'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we  called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
 I 'm  at  a  payphone  trying  to  call  home
All of my change  I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
 I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of sh*t
One more fucking love song  i'll be sick
You turned your back on tomorrow
Cause you forgot yesterday
 I gave you my love  to borrow
But just gave it away
You can't expect me  to be fine
 I don't expect you  to care
 I know  I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down
 I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now  I 'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we  called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
 I 'm  at  a  payphone  trying  to  call  home
All of my change  I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
 I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song  i'll be sick
Now  I 'm  at  a  payphone...
Wiz Khalifa
Man work that shit
 I'll be out spending all this money while you sitting round
Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me  I 'm stunning
And all of my cars start with the push up  a button
Telling me the chances  I blew up or whatever you  call it
Switched the number  to my phone
So you never could  call it
Don't need my name on my show
You can tell it  I 'm ballin'
Swish, what  a shame could have got picked
Had  a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see  at the top
Or what you could've saw
But sad  to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
Now ask me who they want
So you can go and take that little piece of shit with you
 I 'm  at  a  payphone  trying  to  call  home
All of my change  I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
 I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song  i'll be sick
Now  I 'm  at  a  Payphone
