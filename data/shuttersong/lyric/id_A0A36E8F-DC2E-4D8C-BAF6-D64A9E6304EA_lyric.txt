I'm a million miles away
From anywhere
Slide my hands across the sheets
Pretend you're there
But missing you is a slow burn
Every time the earth turns
I'm reminded that the night
Is only half the time

Even when I'm hurting I know that this is worth it
Tell me it'll be alright
Gotta give me something to get me through the nothing
One more night

Kiss me like the world is gonna disappear
I'm a better person when I have you here
I got you, and I can get through
Anything as long as I can see your face
Right now you're so far away, so far away
You're so far away, so far away

I don't need a map to tell me where you are
You and I, we come from the same star
Every day means a heartache
And every night I lie awake
I'm reminded the bed is only half mine

Even when I'm hurting I know that this is worth it
Tell me it'll be alright
Gotta give me something to get me through the nothing
One more night

Kiss me like the world is gonna disappear
I'm a better person when I have you here
I got you, and I can get through
Anything as long as I can see your face
Right now you're so far away, so far away
You're so far away, so far away

Nobody's got the time
Nobody's got the time
Nobody's got the time for love

Nobody's got the time
Nobody's got the time
Nobody's got the time for love

Kiss me like the world is gonna disappear
I'm a better person when I have you here
I got you, and I can get through
Anything as long as I can see your face
Right now you're so far away, so far away
You're so far away, so far away

Kiss me like the world is gonna disappear
I'm a better person when I have you here
I got you, and I can get through
Anything as long as I can see your face
Right now you're so far away, so far away
You're so far away, so far away
