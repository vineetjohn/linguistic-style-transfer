KiD CuDi - Pursuit Of Happiness(Ft. MGMT And Ratatat)
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feelin lit feelin light, 2 am summer night.
I don't care, hand on the wheel, drivin drunk, I'm doin my thing
Rollin the Midwest side and out livin my life getting out dreams
Imma do just what I want lookin ahead no turnin back
if I fall if I die know I lived it to the fullest
Tell me what you know about dreamin dreamin
you don't really know about nothin nothin
tell me what you know about them night terrors every night
5 am, cold sweats wakin up to the skies
tell me what you know about dreams, dreams
tell me what you know about night terrors, nothin
you don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
rather lay awake in a bed full of sorrow
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
everything that shines ain't always gonna be gold
I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
everything that shines ain't always gonna be gold
I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness. I know
everything that shines ain't always gold
I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shines ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it, yeah
I'll be good
