I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm begging you to beg me

I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me

I'll shine up my old brown shoes
I'll put on a brand new shirt
I'll get home early from work
If you say that you love me

Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?
Feeling all alone without a friend you know you feel like dying
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?

I want you to want me
