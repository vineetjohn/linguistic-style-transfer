There was a new girl in town
She had it all figured out
(Had it all figured out)
Well, I'll state something rash
She had the most amazing... smile
I bet you didn't expect that
She made me change my ways
(She made me change my ways)
With eyes like sunsets, baby
And legs that went on for days

I'm falling in love
But it's falling apart
I need to find my way back to the start
When we were in love
Things were better than they are
Let me back into
Into your arms, into your arms

She made her way to the bar
I tried to talk to her but she seemed so far (She seemed so far)
Outta my league (Outta my league)
I had to find a way to get her next to me

I'm falling in love
But it's falling apart
I need to find my way back to the start
When we were in love
Things were better than they are
Let me back into
Into your arms, into your arms

Ah she's slippin' away
I always freeze when I'm thinking of words to say
All the things she does
Make it seem like love
If it's just a game (If it's just a game)
Then I like the way that we play

I'm falling in love
But it's falling apart
I need to find my way back to the start

I'm falling in love
But it's falling apart
I need to find my way back to the start
When we were in love
Things were better than they are
Let me back into
Into your arms, into your arms
Into your arms, into your arms
