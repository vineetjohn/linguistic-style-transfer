Now I'm of consenting age
To be forgetting you in a cabaret
Somewhere downtown where a burlesque queen
May even ask my name
As she sheds her skin on stage
I'm seated and sweating to a dance song on the club's P.A.

The strip joint veteran sits two away
Smirking between dignified sips of his dignified
Peach & lime daiquiri
& isn't this exactly where you'd like me?
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know
Praying for love in a lap dance

& paying in naivety
Oh, isn't this exactly where you'd like me?
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know

Praying for love in a lap dance
& paying in naivety
Oh, but I'm afraid that I

Well I may have faked it
& I wouldn't be caught dead, d-dead, d-dead, d-dead in this place
Well I'm afraid that I
Well that's right, well I may have faked it
& I wouldn't be caught dead in this place
& isn't this exactly where you'd like me?

I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know
Praying for love in a lap dance
& paying in naivety

Oh, isn't this exactly where you'd like me?
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know
Praying for love in a lap dance

& paying in naivety
Well I'm afraid that I
Well I may have faked it
& I wouldn't be caught dead, d-dead, d-dead, d-dead in this place
Well I'm afraid that I
Well that's right, well I may have faked it

& I wouldn't be caught dead in this place
& isn't this exactly where you'd like me?
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know
Praying for love in a lap dance
& paying in naivety
Oh, isn't this exactly where you'd like me?
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know
Praying for love in a lap dance
& paying in naivety
Praying for love & paying in naivety
Praying for love & paying in naivety, oh
