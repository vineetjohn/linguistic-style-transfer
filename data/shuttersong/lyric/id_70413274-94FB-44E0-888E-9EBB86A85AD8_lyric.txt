Blood stains won't make it matter
got good things
got you
hoops and everything
get back never get back too soon
are you lonely
are you there when I'm not in the room
are you only
only a part of this when you choose
is it real
is it something that you can not touch
do you feel
do you feel that you feel too much
blood stains won't make it matter
got good things
got you
hoops and everything
get back never get back too soon
blood stains make confusing patterns
they lead me to you
hoops and everything
get back never get back too soon
something crazy
something changing in the way you talk
you are lately
lately you are trying to be the one on top
come on down
come on and give it to me like you should
gonna drown
I give up and get on with the life lived good

say it on the telephone
say it in my head
say it in my head
say it in my head
writing down all the things go wrong
and the ink ran red
and the ink ran red
and the ink ran red
blood stains wont make it matter
got good things
got you
hoops and everything
get back never get back too soon
get back never get back too soon
get back never get back too soon
get back never get back
get back never get back
get back never get back too soon
get back never get back too soon
yes its true
hoops and everything
get back never get back too soon
get back never get back too soon
get back never get back too soon
get back never get back
get back never get back
