So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention, do you
I know you don't listen to me
'Cause you say you see straight through me
Don't you

But on and on
From the moment I wake
To the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side
Just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line
Just to see if you care

Oh, did you want me to change
Well, I'd change for good
And I want you to know that you'll always get your way
And I wanted to say

Don't you shiver
Shiver
I'll sing it loud and clear
I'll always be waiting for you

So you know how much I need you
But you never even see me, do you
And is this my final chance of getting you

But on and on
From the moment I wake
To the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side
Just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line
Just to see if you care, if you care

Did you want me to change
Well, I'd change for good
And I want you to know that you'll always get your way
And I wanted to say

Don't you shiver
Don't you shiver
I'll sing it loud and clear
I'll always be waiting for you

Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
For you, I will always be waiting

And it's you I see
But you don't see me
And it's you, I hear
So loud and so clear
I sing it loud and clear
And I'll always be waiting for you
So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention
And you know how much I need you
But you never even see me
