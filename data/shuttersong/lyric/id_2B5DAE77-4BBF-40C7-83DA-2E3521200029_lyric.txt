First off, give a girl some credit
Imma keep on loving you, 'cause you be the realest
All day and all night
That's why you stay by my side

I don't always do the right thing
And that don'tmatter, 'cause nobody's perfect here, no.
If you leave, I can't make you stay

Where you going, where you tryna go
Where you going, where you tryna go
Baby, baby?
Where you going, where you tryna go
Where you going, where you tryna go
Baby, baby?

Sit yourself down, 'cause you know you're gonna stay
Boy, you better listen to the words I say
You ain't going nowhere.
You ain't going nowhere.
Boy, you better act like you got some sense
'Cause you got a dime, and that's money well spent.
You ain't going nowhere.
You ain't going nowhere.

We'll be here all day
If you start pointing fingers my way
I just wish you love me, love me, baby
If you can do that, then I'll do the same, yeah

We can make it work, baby
We'd be crazy if we don't try
Love and hate is such a thin line.

Where you going, where you tryna go
Where you going, where you tryna go
Baby, baby? (oh oh)
Where you going, where you tryna go
Where you going, where you tryna go
Baby, baby?

Sit yourself down, 'cause you know you're gonna stay
Boy, you better listen to the words I say
You ain't going nowhere.
You ain't going nowhere.
Boy, you better act like you got some sense
'Cause you got a dime, and that's money well spent.
You ain't going nowhere.
You ain't going nowhere.

If you're waiting for me
You gon' be waiting all night
If you're gonna play games, you're gonna lose
You'll be sorry if you say goodbye
Yeah, I still want you, but I don't need you
You should be happy I'm still here for you
Don't have to be, you must be blind if you can't see.

Where you going, where you tryna go
Where you going, where you tryna go
Baby, baby?
Where you going, where you tryna go
Where you going, where you tryna go
Baby, baby?

Sit yourself down, 'cause you know you're gonna stay
Boy, you better listen to the words I say
You ain't going nowhere.
You ain't going nowhere.
Boy, you better act like you got some sense
'Cause you got a dime, and that's money well spent.
You ain't going nowhere.
You ain't going nowhere.
Sit yourself down, 'cause you know you're gonna stay
Boy, you better listen to the words I say
You ain't going nowhere.
You ain't going nowhere.
Boy, you better act like you got some sense
'Cause you got a dime, and that's money well spent.
You ain't going nowhere.
You ain't going nowhere.
