Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you

Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start

Running in circles, coming up tails
Heads on a science apart
Nobody said it was easy

It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard

Oh, take me back to the start
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress

Do not speak as loud as my heart

But tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails

Coming back as we are
Nobody said it was easy
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start
Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ah ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
