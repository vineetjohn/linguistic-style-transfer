You walked in
Everyone was asking for your name
You just smiled

and told them trouble
My head spins
I'm pressed against the wall
Just watching your every move
You're way too cool
And you're coming this way
Coming this way

How did we end up talking in the first place
You said you like my Cobain shirt
Now we're walking back to your place
You're telling me how you love that song
About living on a prayer
I'm pretty sure that we're halfway there
And when I wake up next to you I wonder how
How did we end up here?

Next day out
Everybody thought you were so insane
Cause you were so far out of my league
My friends say I should lock you down
Before you figure me out and you run away
But you don't and you won't as you kiss me
And you tell me that you're here to stay

How did we end up talking in the first place
You said you like my Cobain shirt
Now were walking back to your place
You're telling me how you love that song
About living on a prayer
I'm pretty sure that we're halfway there
And when I wake up next to you I wonder how
How did we end up here?

Call me lucky 'cause in the end
I'm a 6 and she's a 10
She's so fit
I'm insecure
But she keeps coming back for more

How did we end up talking in the first place
You said you like my Cobain shirt
Now were walking back to your place
You're telling me how you love that song
About living on a prayer
I'm pretty sure that we're halfway there
And when I wake up next to you I wonder how
How did we end up here?
