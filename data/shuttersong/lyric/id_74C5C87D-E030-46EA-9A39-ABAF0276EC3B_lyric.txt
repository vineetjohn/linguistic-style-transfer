Oh, her eyes, her eyes,
make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair,
falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful,
and I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know,
when I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so,
sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me do I look ok,
I say
When I see your face,
there's not a thing that I would change
Because you're amazing,
just the way you are
And when you smile,
the whole world stops and stares for a while
Because girl you're amazing,
just the way you are
Her lips, her lips,
I could kiss them all day if she let me
Her laugh, her laugh,
she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful,
and I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know,
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
So,
don't even bother asking if you look ok
You know I'll say
When I see your face,
there's not a thing that I would change
Because you're amazing,
just the way you are
And when you smile,
the whole world stops and stares for a while
Because girl you're amazing,
just the way you are
The way you are,
the way you are
Girl you're amazing,
just the way you are
When I see your face,
there's not a thing that I would change
Because you're amazing,
just the way you are
And when you smile,
the whole world stops and stares for a while
Because girl you're amazing,
just the way you are.
