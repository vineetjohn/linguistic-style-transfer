American woman, stay away from me
American woman, mama let me be
Don't come hangin' around my door
I don't wanna see your face no more
I got more important things to do
Than spend my time growin' old with you
Now woman, I said stay away
American woman, listen what i say...

American woman, get away from me
American women, mama let me be

Don't come knockin' around my door
Don't wanna see your shadow no more
Coloured lights can hypnotize
Sparkle someone else's eyes
Now woman, said get away
American woman, listen what I say. hey, hey, hey ...
(Solo)
American woman, said get away

American women, listen what I say
Don't come hangin' around my door
Don't wanna see your face no more

I don't need your war machine
I don't need your ghetto scenes
Coloured lights can hypnotize
Sparkle someone else's eyes
Now woman, get away from me
American woman, mama let me be
Go, gotta get away, got to get away, now go, go, go
I'm gonna leave you, woman
Gonna leave you, woman
Bye-bye...
Bye-bye...
Bye-bye...
Bye-bye...
You're no good for me
I'm no good for you
Gonna look you right in the eye.
Tell you what I'm gonna do
You know I'm gonna leave...
You know I'm gonna go...
You know I'm gonna leave...
You know I'm gonna go, woman
I'm gonna leave, woman
Goodbye, American woman
Goodbye, American chick.
