Do you remember the taste of my lips that night
I stole a bit of my mother's perfume
Cause I remember when my father put his fist through the wall that separated the
dining room
And I remember the fear in your eyes
The very first time we snuck into the city pool
Late December with my heart in my chest and the clouds in my breath
Didn't know where we were running to

But don't look back
Cause we'll be looking for sunlight
Or the headlights
Till our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be lacing the same shoes
That we've worn through
To the bottom of the line
And we know that we're headstrong
And our heart's gone
And the timing's never right

But for now let's get away

On a Roman holiday
Could you imagine the taste of your lips if we'd never try to kiss on the drive
to Queens
Cause I imagine the weight of your ribs if you lied between my hips in the backseat
I imagine the tears in your eyes
The very first night I'll sleep without you

And when it happens I'll be miles away
And a few months late

Didn't know where I was running to
But I won't look back
We'll be looking for sunlight
Or the headlights
Till our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be lacing the same shoes
That we've worn through
To the bottom of the line
And we know that we're headstrong

And our heart's gone
And the timing's never right
For now let's get away

On a Roman holiday
Feet first, don't fall
Or we'll be running again
Keep close, stand tall
We'll be looking for sunlight
Or the headlights
Till our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be lacing the same shoes
That we've worn through
To the bottom of the line
And we know that we're headstrong
And our heart's gone
And the timing's never right
But for now let's get away
On a Roman holiday
