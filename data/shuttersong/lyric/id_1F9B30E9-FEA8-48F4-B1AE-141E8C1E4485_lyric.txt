No more I'm taking this hatred from you

You make me feel dead when I'm talking to you
You'll take me for granted when I'm not around
So burn all your bridges 'cause I'm not going down
This time I will be heard
I'm not gonna burn

It's funny how the table
How the table turns
You fake (fake) God damnation

You pray (pray) for salvation
'Cause your heart is made of stone
You can die and rot alone
I hope you're unhappy and hurting inside

I want you to choke when you swallow your pride
Lay in your coffin and sleep with your sins
Give me the nails and I'll hammer them in right now
This time you won't be heard

You are gonna burn

It's funny how the table
How the table turns
You fake (fake) God damnation

You pray (pray) for salvation
'Cause your heart is made of stone
You can die and rot alone
You fake (fake) God damnation

You pray (pray) for salvation
'Cause your heart is made of stone
You can die and rot alone
This time you won't be heard

You are gonna burn

You pray (pray) for salvation
'Cause your heart is made of stone
You can die and rot alone
You can die and rot alone
Just die and rot alone!
This time you won't be heard
(This time you won't be heard)
This time you won't be heard.
