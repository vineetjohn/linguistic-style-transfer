I didn't want to be the one to forget
I thought of everything I'd never regret
A little time with you is all that I get
That¡¯s all we need because it's all we can take

One thing I never see the same when your 'round
I don¡¯t believe in him¡ªhis lips on the ground
I wanna take you to that place in the ¡°Roche¡±
But no one gives us any time anymore

He ask me once if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it, then you ran off
I got this picture of us kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said

[Pre Chorus]
"I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine"
I didn't want to anymore, oh oh oh

[Chorus]
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend

Some more again

[Verse 2]
It didn't matter what they wanted to see
He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time
He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissor at the seem in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he would fall
One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold
Take it, I don't wanna sing anymore

[Pre Chorus]
"I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine"
I didn't want to anymore, oh oh oh

[Chorus]
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door...

I don't understand, don't get upset
I'm not with you
We¡¯re swimming around,
It's all I do, when I'm with you

[Chorus]
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
