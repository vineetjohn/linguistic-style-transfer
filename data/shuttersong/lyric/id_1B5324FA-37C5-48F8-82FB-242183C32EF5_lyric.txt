 I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
And then it was clear 
 I can¡¯t deny,  I really miss him
 To think that  I was wrong
 I guess you don¡¯t know what you got til it¡¯s gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
 I¡¯m saying sorry for the sake of us
He wasn¡¯t my everything till we were nothing
And it¡¯s taking me a lot  to say
But now that he¡¯s gone, my heart is missing something
So it¡¯s time  I push my pride away
¡¯Cause you are, you are
You are my everything
 you are, you are
You are my everything
 I know you¡¯re not far but  I still can¡¯t handle all the distance
You¡¯re travelling with my heart
 I hope this is a temporary feeling
¡¯Cause it¡¯s too much  to bare
Without you and  I know sorry ain¡¯t the cure 
So if  I cross your mind just know  I¡¯m yours 
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for
'Cause you are
He wasn¡¯t my everything till we were nothing
And it¡¯s taking me a lot  to say
But now that he¡¯s gone, my heart is missing something
So it¡¯s time  I push my pride away
 you are, you are
You are my everything
 you are, you are
You are my everything
you are, you are
you are, you are my everything
