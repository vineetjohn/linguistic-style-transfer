I found your hairband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you'd been here before
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never getting dry, so I get high, smoke away the days
Never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night
I don't drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall with the head spin I got

My mind's with you but my heart's just not
So am I close to you anymore, if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out
That's why you and I ended over U.N.I.
And I said that's fine

But you're the only one that knows I lied

You and I ended over U.N.I.
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
Everybody said we'd be together forever
But I know that I never wanna settle down, come around
Break up the love like lego now
Never wanna turn into another like you
Sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views
Everything's great but not everything's sure
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I'm in position to be another stalker
And every thing I say seems to always sound awkward

Like our last kiss, it was perfect
We were nervous, on the surface

And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it
Pain is only relevent if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant, or we can use a sedative

And go back to the day we fell in love
Just on our first kiss
So am I close to you anymore, if it's over

And there's no chance that we'll work it out
Oh you and I ended over U.N.I.
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U.N.I.

And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
Wo-ooooahhhh oohh ohh
Because, if I was gonna go somewhere

I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down, wo-oahh
And thinking that I am unaware
I keep my feet on the ground, keep
Looking around, to make sure I'm not
The only one to feel low
Because if you want
I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
From all that I've done wrong
And I know you'll say
That I'm the only one
But I know God made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will
'Cause you and I ended over U.N.I.
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one who knows that I lied
You and I ended over U.N.I.
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one who knows that I lied
