So it starts
We go back to your house
We check the charts
And start to figure it out

And if it's crowded, all the better
Cause we know we're gonna be up late
And if you're worried about the weather
Then you picked the wrong place to stay
That's how it starts

And so it starts
You turn the engine on
We set controls for the heart of the sun
One of the ways that we show our age

And if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up
Then I still don't wanna stagger home
Then it's the memory of our betters
That are keeping us on our feet

You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
And the next five years trying to be with your friends again
You're talking 45 turns just as fast as you can
Yeah, I know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretend

To tell the truth
Oh, this could be the last time
So here we go
Like a sale force into the night

You drop the first ten years just as fast as you can
And the next ten people who are trying to be polite
You're blowing eighty-five days in the middle of France
Yeah, I know it gets tired only where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends, where are your friends tonight?

If you could see all your friends tonight
If you could see all your friends tonight
You know you'd be with your friends for life
If you could see all your friends tonight
