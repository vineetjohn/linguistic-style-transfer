La, la-la-la-la-la
La, la-la-la-la-la
I don't wanna write this love song
I, I'm fighting this urge
But you make me say ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Damn, 'cause I, I can't find the words
I don't wanna write this love song
Just wanna dance all night till it hurts
But you make me say ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Damn, 'cause I, I can't find the words
Ooh, you stole my heart we had a summerthing
And I told my heart it was just a summerthing
But you made me fall in the winter
Bloom in the spring
From June 'till December

It was you and me
And I told my heart it was just a summerthing
That it was just a summerthing!
This, this ain't no love song, it's just a little ditty, baby

I just wanna go uh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Damn, 'cause you, you're so pretty baby
This, this ain't no love song, just wanna watch you dance, sexy baby
I just wanna go ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Damn, that's if you, if you let me baby
Ooh, you stole my heart, we had a summerthing

And I told my heart it was just a summerthing
But you made me fall in the winter

Bloom in the spring
From June 'till December
It was you and me
And I told my heart it was just a summerthing

That it was a summerthing
I will always remember the summer, the summerthing
Oh, you'll always remember the summer, the summerthing
I will always remember the summer, the summerthing
Oh, you'll always remember the summer, the summerthing
You stole my heart, we had a summerthing
And I told my heart it was just a summerthing
But you made me fall in the winter
Bloom in the spring
From June 'till December
It was you and me
And I told my heart it was just a summerthing
That it was a summerthing
