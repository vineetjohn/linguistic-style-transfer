I know that we are upside down
So hold your tongue and hear me out
I know that we were made to break
So what? I don't mind

You kill the lights, I'll draw the blinds
Don't dull the sparkle in your eyes
I know that we were made to break
So what? I don't mind

Are you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Oh oh oh, are you gonna stay the night?

Are you gonna stay the night?
Doesn't mean we're bound for life
So oh oh oh, are you gonna stay the night?

[Beat break]

Are you gonna stay the night?
Doesn't mean we're bound for life
So oh oh, are you gonna stay the night?

I am a fire, you're gasoline,
Come pour yourself all over me
We'll let this place go down in flames only one more time

You kill the lights, I'll draw the blinds
Don't dull the sparkle in your eyes
I know that we were made to break
So what? I don't mind

Are you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Oh oh oh, are you gonna stay the night?

Are you gonna stay the night? (we get burned!)
Doesn't mean we're bound for life (we never learn!)
So oh oh, are you gonna stay the night?
Night night night night night...

[Beat break]

ARE YOU GONNA STAY THE NIGHT?!

[Beat break]

Are you gonna stay the night?
Doesn't mean we're bound for life
So oh oh, are you gonna stay the night?

[Zedd:]
Are you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Oh oh oh oh.
Are you gonna stay the night?
