Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous night to make romance
'Neath the cover of October skies
And all the leaves on the trees are falling
To the sound of the breezes that blow
You know I'm trying to please to the calling
Of your heartstrings that play soft and low
You know the night's magic seems to whisper and hush
You know the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush

Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?
Can I just make some more romance with a-you, my love?

Well, I wanna make love to you tonight
I can't wait till the morning has come
You know, I know now the time is just right
And straight into my arms you will run
And when you come, my heart will be waiting
To make sure that you're never alone
There and then all my dreams will come true, dear
There and then I will make you my own
And every time I touch you, you just tremble inside
And I know how much you want me, that you can't hide

Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?
Can I just make some more romance with a-you, my love?

Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?
Can I just make some more romance with a-you, my love?

One more moondance with you
In the moonlight
On a magic night
La, la, la, la, la in the moonlight
On a magic night
Can't I just have one more, moon dance with you, my love?
