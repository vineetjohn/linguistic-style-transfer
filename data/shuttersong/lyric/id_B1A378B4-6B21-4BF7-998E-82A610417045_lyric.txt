Mysterious, blown in with the night
All this beauty captured in a frame
Visibly shaken, but never stirred
Drives them insane
I see the way she plays her men
And I know I've got to know her name

She's so beautifully broken
Shaped by the wind
Dangerously twisted
Here I go again

I see the way she cast her spell
It's like drowning in moonlight
Discards them she's done
They're lost in her twilight
I watch her move from star to star
And I wonder why, why it feels so right

She's so beautifully broken
You can barely see the flaw
Especially from a distance
Which is always how I fall

Why do I fall for the dangerous ones?
The ones that never learned to let go
And why do I lie to myself
And pretend that I can break her
When she's already been so

Beautifully broken

Why do I fall for the dangerous ones?
The ones that don't know how to let go
And why do I lie to myself
And pretend that I could break her
When she's already been so

Beautifully broken
Shaped by the wind
Dangerously twisted
Here I go again
Here I go again
