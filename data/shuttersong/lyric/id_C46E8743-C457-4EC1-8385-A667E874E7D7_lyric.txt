All the stars may shine bright
All the clouds may be white
But when you smile
Oh how I feel so good
That I can hardly wait

To hold you
Enfold you
Never enough
Render your heart to me

All mine
You have to be

From that cloud, number nine
Danger starts the sharp incline
And such sad regrets
Oh as those starry skies
As they swiftly fall

Make no mistake
You shan't escape
Tethered and tied
There's nowhere to hide from me

All mine
You have to be

So don't resist
We shall exist
Until the day
Until the day I die
All mine
You have to be
