Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start but can't complete

Listen, to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning
To find release

Oh, the time has come
For my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own
All cause you won't
Listen

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home, in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own

You should have listened
There is someone here inside
Someone I'd thought had died
So long ago

Oh, I'm screaming out, and my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worse
Into your own
All cause you won't
Listen

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home, in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own

I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't
If you won't

Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start
But I will complete

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you've made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own
My own
