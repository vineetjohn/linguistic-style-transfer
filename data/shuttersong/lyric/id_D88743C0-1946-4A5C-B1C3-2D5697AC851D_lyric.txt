Time to change has come and gone
Watched your fears become your god
It's your decision
It's your decision

Overwhelmed, you chose to run
Apathetic to the stunned
It's your decision
It's your decision

You feed the fire that burned us all
When you lied
To feel the pain that spurs you on
Black inside

No-one plans to take the path that brings you nowhere
Here you stand before us all and say it's over
It's over

(Guitar Solo by Jerry Cantrell)
It might seem an after thought
Yes it hurts to know you're bought
It's your decision

It's your decision
You feed the fire that burned us all
When you lied
To feel the pain that spurs you on

Black inside
It's your decision
It's your decision
No-one plans to take the path that brings you nowhere
Here you stand before us all and say it's over
It's over
It's over...
