My feet are where my head goes
My head is where my feet lay
¡°Wake Me Up¡± playing on replay
I don¡¯t really know how to go about my day
I¡¯m kinda off, everything I touch falls to pieces
I never seem to figure out the reason
Maybe I should really try to think about my feelings
The only time you¡¯re here is when you¡¯re leaving

So if you say you¡¯re here to stay
I won¡¯t take it to the heart
¡®Cause if you leave so does a piece of me
And I¡¯m fallin¡¯ all apart

All I ask is that you be there
That you be there
Promise that you¡¯ll be there
That you be there
When I need a friend
When I need a shoulder
When I need someone that I can grow with when I¡¯m older
Promise that you¡¯ll be there
That you¡¯ll be there

So you¡¯re leavin¡¯ in a few days
I never thought that you¡¯d stay
By the time I called that home it was too late
Even if I begged you
You know I don¡¯t get you
Maybe all I need to do is pray
¡®Cause you can never recognize the difference
Why is it so hard for you to listen?
Maybe you should really try to think about my feelings
The only time you¡¯re here is when you¡¯re leaving

So if you say you¡¯re here to stay
I won¡¯t take it to the heart
¡®Cause if you leave so does a piece of me
And I¡¯m fallin¡¯ all apart

All I ask is that you be there
That you be there
Promise that you¡¯ll be there
That you be there
When I need a friend
When I need a shoulder
When I need someone that I can grow with when I¡¯m older
Promise that you¡¯ll be there
That you¡¯ll be there
Yeah, yeah

Be there for me in times of need when you¡¯re free
¡®Cause you know I¡¯ll be there for you
If not, baby, don¡¯t waste your time calling me
When you need someone to care for you
