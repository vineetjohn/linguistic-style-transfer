When I look up at the stars
No matter where you are
You're always in my heart
You're always in my heart

When the walls are closing in
You're the sun upon my skin
You're always where I am
You're always where I am

Wild child
Living in the moment
World in my arms
Too young to know it
Oh, you made me feel so alive
(We were young and wild)
Had a good thing going
But we couldn't make it
Even if I could
I wouldn't change it
When I look back I just smile
We were young and wild

When I was feeling black and blue
I could always count on you
You always made me new
Always made me new

And even though it was the end
If you ever need a friend
I'll be coming back again
I'll be coming back again

Wild child
Nothing that could stop us
Parking in the cut
And fogging up the windows
Oh, you made me feel so alive
(We were young and wild)
They say nothing good's
Gonna last forever
We were pedal to the metal
And always together
When I look back I just smile

I lay there silent in the sand
And listen while you whisper
To another lonely setting sun
Whose heart is always distant
Memories won't be the death of me
As long as I could feel you
Long as I could feel you

Wild child
Do you still remember
Skip school, drink
And get high agenda
Oh, it made me feel so alive
(We were young and wild)
Like my first real love
That I thought would make it
Our greatest gifts can be
Mistakes we're making
So when I look back I just smile
We were young and wild

(I remember, I remember back in the day)
(I remember, I remember back in the day)
Young and wild
(I remember, I remember back in the day, I remember)
Young and wild
(I remember, I remember back in the day, I remember)
