And she'll always get the best of me the worst is yet to come
At least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young

But I love it but I love it oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it but I love it oh
And I know she'll be the death of me at least we'll both be numb

All the misery was necessary when we're deep in love
