Hello? What the deal? Bet

I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin' I'm ring, ring, ringin'
Countin' money while they ring, ring, ringin'
Trap jumpin' I'm ring, ring, ringin'
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin' I'm ring, ring, ringin'
Countin' money while they ring, ring, ringin'
Trap jumpin' I'm ring, ring, ringin'

Button start the foreign, oh my God I'm gorgeous
I just put the key inside my pocket park
It might not get to see, this a new Ferrari
Man in the mirror, how you choose to bother
Someone said they callin', I don't feel like talkin'
Everything is different returned the way I bought it
Phone be interrupting me while I'm recordin'
Phone be making women feel they unimportant
Call my dog, he say it's all the way retarded
Keep the [?] cause I am not using the Foreman
Kitchen, I just finished up new performance
Hater, wish you well
I got cliental
I just got it off the scale

I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin' I'm ring, ring, ringin'
Countin' money while they ring, ring, ringin'
Trap jumpin' I'm ring, ring, ringin'
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough

There they go again, one of my lil friends
They don't give a damn how a nigga been
All they wanna know is what I got to give
How much did I spend? What I got to lend?
What I did and what I didn't do for them
Brick comin' in somewhere on the rim
Section doin' numbers, nowhere by a gym
Rappin' bottles spin [?] I'm supplin' 10
Jumpin' out a Honda, I just got it in
Askin' what I cop, none of your concern
One day you gone learn what you tryna get
Everything on sale, goin' out of biz
Partners up in jail, gotta feed the kids
Juggin' round the city, you know what it is
Bread winner business, put that on the wrist

I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin' I'm ring, ring, ringin'
Countin' money while they ring, ring, ringin'
Trap jumpin' I'm ring, ring, ringin'
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load

Ring, ring, ringin' man
Find me balling hard
Come from grinding hard
Getting calling cards from your Barbie doll
When she round me she know I'm her bodyguard
Money callin' for me, baby girl I'm sorry
You just side yelling you not that important
Weight, shape her, pin you to the carpet
Smell like tarter, I'mma put you in the water
Conversation cause a lot of chips
She don't really get a lot of this
Engagin' where I'm gazin' at her hips
And ain't nobody makin' no attempts
Amazing clip, hanging, slanging dick
Maybe we can make it takin' trips
Maybe I was thinkin' too impatient
Phone ringing, hold up, what it is?

I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin' I'm ring, ring, ringin'
Countin' money while they ring, ring, ringin'
Trap jumpin' I'm ring, ring, ringin'
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
