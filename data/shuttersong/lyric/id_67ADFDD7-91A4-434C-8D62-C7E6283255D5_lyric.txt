How soon do we forget how we felt
Dealing with emotions that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
Maybe I¡¯m the sinner, and not a saint
Gotta stop pretending what we ain¡¯t
Why we pointing fingers anyway? We¡¯re the same
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds?
And stop acting like we¡¯re blind
Cause if the water dries up
And the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy you know I¡¯ll be savin¡¯ my love for you for you
Cause you¡¯re the best mistake I¡¯ve ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There¡¯s no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on
I guess time¡¯s wasting, tick tockin¡¯ lip lockin¡¯
How can we keep the feelins¡¯ fresh
how do we zip lock them
Wear your heart up on your sleeve
so watch for pickpockets
I guess to go the distance
we might need to pit stop it
Hold up,I know love can be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten lost
my temper and went back to four
I know sometimes it¡¯s hard to realize
I¡¯m the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out started a family tree
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You ask why I love your mom
so much ¡¯cause she¡¯s an older you
I wish that you were happy
I guess that¡¯s the one thing I should be providing
Ain¡¯t no number twos
we both ones of ones and we the oddest
Couple only human ¡®cept you,
you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down,
just being honest
When you start as friends
it¡¯s hard to say you¡¯re never going back
If I¡¯m not the one then
I¡¯m the best mistake you ever had
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds?
And stop acting like we¡¯re blind
Cause if the water dries up
And the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy you know I¡¯ll be savin¡¯ my love for you,for you
Cause you¡¯re the best mistake I¡¯ve ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There¡¯s no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on
You¡¯re, you¡¯re, you¡¯re, you¡¯re
I¡¯ll be savin¡¯ my love for you, for you
You¡¯re, you¡¯re, you¡¯re, you¡¯re
(Best mistake you ever had,
best mistake you ever had)
I¡¯ll be savin¡¯ my love for you, for you
