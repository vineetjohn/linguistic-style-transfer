Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on
Our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yule-tide gay
From now on
Our troubles will be miles away.

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore.
Faithful friends who stay dear to us
They gather near to us once more.

Through the years
We'll always be together
If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.
And have yourself A merry little Christmas now.
