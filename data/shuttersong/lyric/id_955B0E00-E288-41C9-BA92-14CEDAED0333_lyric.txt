I hate to see you cry
Lying there in that position
There's things you need to hear
So turn off your tears
And listen

Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No it won't all go the way
it should

But I know the heart of life is good
You know, it's nothing new
Bad news never had good timing
Then, circle of your friends

Will defend the silver lining
Pain throws your heart to the
ground
Love turns the whole thing around

No it won't all go the way
It should
But I know the heart of life is good
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
Fear is a friend who's misunderstood
But I know the heart of life is good
I know it's good
