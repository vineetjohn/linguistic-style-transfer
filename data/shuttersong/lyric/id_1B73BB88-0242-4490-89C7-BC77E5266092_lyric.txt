Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go

Hey ho, let's go
They're forming in a straight line
They're going through a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds

Blitzkrieg Bop
They're piling in the back seat
They generate steam heat
Pulsatin' to the back beat

Blitzkrieg Bop
Hey ho, let's go
Shoot them in the back now
What they want, I don't know

They're all revved up and ready to go
They're forming in a straight line
They're going through a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds

The Blitzkrieg Bop
They're piling in the back seat
They generate steam heat
Pulsatin' to the back beat
