Ja Rule, Chuck B-more
Every thug needs a lady
And every thug needs a down ass bitch, feel me
Every thug needs a lady
Baby I'm convinced, you my down ass bitch

Baby say yeah
(Baby say yeah)
If you'd lie for me, like you lovin' me
Baby say yeah
(Baby say yeah)
If you'd die for me, like you cry for me
Baby say yeah
(Baby say yeah)
If you'd kill for me, like you comfort me
Baby say yeah
(Baby say yeah)

Girl I'm convinced, you're my down ass bitch

I know that you're lovin' me 'cause you thug with me
Who bust slugs for me, My baby
Who gon' kill for you, like I comfort you, who else but the Rule?
You feel me, girl when we connect the dots we hit the spot
Twin Benz's, you ride hard, I ride drop
And to make it better, baby got the nina' Beretta tucked low

And I'm two cars back with the four-four
And it freaks you out, on your Momma's couch

That's what us thugs be 'bout
(You know me)
And when I pray for love, baby pray for us, who celebrates the thugs?
(My lady)
Got me seekin' capital game when I spit sixteen

Whether bars or sixteens in the doors of cars
(A star is born)
In the hood, made a name live on, R U L E, ladies, feel me

Baby say yeah
(Baby say yeah)
If you'd lie for me, like you lovin' me
Baby say yeah
(Baby say yeah)

Baby say yeah
(Baby say yeah)
Girl I'm convinced, you're my down ass bitch

Now I'm show you blood or love, there's no belly you bounce from
Blow sellin', dough amounts to no tellin'
There'll be no tellin', snitches get it back

Those gats to your backs for my boy, what part of the game is that?
Niggas and they feelings
'Cause I handle your dealings, keep your name intact
My fame's intact so cops won't know what it's hittin' for
Now hoes wanna know what you shittin' for

'Cause I'm your bitch, the Bonnie to your Clyde
It's mental, mash your enemies, we out in the rental

I'm your bitch, niggas run up on ya
Shift ya lungs, who's your organ donor?
What they know about extreme meausures, I'm a ride with you
And my baby three-eighty at my side
And we lock the town, I'm as down as any thug
My love, they gotta take us in blood, what

Baby say yeah
(Baby say yeah)
If you'd lie for me, like you lovin' me
Baby say yeah

If you'd die for me, like you cry for me
Baby say yeah

If you'd kill for me, like you comfort me
Baby say yeah
(Baby say yeah)

Girl I'm convinced, you're my down ass bitch

You could die from love at any given time I could die from slugs
But that's what this life is capable of
The death and the life of a bitch and a thug, is what I'm scared of
But got a woman that ain't afraid to, tuck the toast in the Escalade
Pop on niggas that showin' me shade

But only for the Rule 'cause that's my baby

Got me a down ass bitch with red hair, that don't care
Blazed by the shots and flares
Girl c'mon, follow me and bust back at police, conceal ya heat
It's a bit much to blaze up
Rule and Chuck and I.G., The Murderers, I-N-C
With one on the hip, one in the holster, nigga will toast ya quick
Especially a down ass bitch
