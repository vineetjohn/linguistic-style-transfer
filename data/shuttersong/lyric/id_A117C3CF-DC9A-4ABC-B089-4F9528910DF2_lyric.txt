Early in the morning's when I think about you
I hit you like what you sayin'
And the morning when I wanna fuck you
Yeah, I hit you like what you sayin'
I could fuck you all the time
I could fuck you all the time

M-O-E-T
That's what the fuck we be sippin
That's what the fuck be drippin
My Trap house still tippin
Face time while I'm gone
She gave me dome from the distance
She love to climb on top
But she love to walk off limping
Pimps up, hoes down
Legs up or toes down
Why she jock me, cause she knocked knee'd
And we got trees, so many go around
Gotta know I ate her
She so sweet now and later
I want that all the time, all the time
I know you all mine...
