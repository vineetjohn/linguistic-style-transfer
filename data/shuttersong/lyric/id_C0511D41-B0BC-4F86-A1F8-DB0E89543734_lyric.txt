She doesn't call before midnight, if at all

Oh, she never stays to watch the night turn to day

But I'm like use me baby, anyway you want
I wish you were mine in the broad daylight

But you just use me baby, anyway you want
I wish you were mine but
She only loves me when the lights are off, lights are off
She only loves me when the sun is down, sun is down
She only loves me when no one's around, one's around
She only loves me cause I put it down

That's fine by me

And it's fine by me
She's like the wind, she comes and goes and again

All of my friends think I'm a fool, silly them
But I'm like use me baby, anyway you want
I wish you were mine in the broad daylight
But you just use me baby, anyway you want
I wish you were mine but

She only loves me when the lights are off, lights are off
She only loves me when the sun is down, sun is down

She only loves me when no one's around, one's around
She only loves me cause I put it down
That's fine by me
And it's fine by me
She knows I can take her there, afterwards she just don't care
She knows I can take her there, afterwards she just don't care
She only loves me when the lights are off, lights are off
She only loves me when the sun is down, sun is down
She only loves me when no one's around, one's around
She only loves me cause I put it down
You a freak, and it's fine by me
You a freak, and it's fine by me
That's fine by me
And it's fine by me
And it's fine by me
