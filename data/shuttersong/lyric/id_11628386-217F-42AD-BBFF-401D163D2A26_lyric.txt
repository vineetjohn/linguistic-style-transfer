You got in so late
It's sunday morning
Said that you were leaving
Letting go of us
Where did we go wrong? oh
And now you say you're leaving California
Gotta head back East and want to leave tonight
Pack your things and go
But if you run away
I won't be alright

Even if the sun crashes into us
I won't let go, I won't let go
And I can be your light
Stay with me tonight
I won't let go, I won't let go

Oooh Oooh Oooh...

Yeah
Pick up all the pieces
Fight to hold on
Put 'em back together, do it all for love
Never let it go
Oh, yeah
Cause I don't need a reason
Just to hold ya
Wipe all of your tears and
Look you in the eyes
Baby please don't go

Oh, yeah
But if you run away

I won't be alright
Even if the sun crashes into us
I won't let go, I won't let go

And I can be your light
Stay with me tonight
I won't let go, I won't let go
Oooh Oooh Oooh...
Yeah, yeah
Now you say you're leaving California
