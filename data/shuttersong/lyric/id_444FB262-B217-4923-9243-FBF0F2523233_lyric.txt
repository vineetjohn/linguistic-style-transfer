Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Simmer down, simmer down
They say we're too young now to amount to anything else
But look around
We work too damn hard for this just to give it up now
If you don't swim, you'll drown
But don't move, honey

She looks so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now, that I'm so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now, that I'm so down

Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Let's get out, let's get out
'Cause this deadbeat town's only here just to keep us down
While I was out, I found myself alone just thinking
If I showed up with a plane ticket

And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it
Would you wanna run away too?
'Cause all I really want is you
She looks so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear

And I know now, that I'm so down
I made a mixtape straight out of '94
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the floor
And I know now, that I'm so down
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey
You look so perfect standing there

In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now, that I'm so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now, that I'm so down
Hey!

Hey, hey, hey, hey
She looks so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now, that I'm so down (Hey!)
Your lipstick stain (Hey!) is a work of art
I got your name tattooed (Hey!) in an arrow heart
And I know now, (Hey!) that I'm so down
Hey!
