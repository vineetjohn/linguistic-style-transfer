All we have
It's a little scare
We don't mind
And we don't care

Remember,
I thought you died
I hold you now
Won't let you cry

Love will bring us back
Love will bring us back
Love will bring us back
Love will bring us back
Back a new day
Back a new day
Back a new day
Back a new day

Seven years
we're still together and
The time has left
A little scare

But I want you to know
That you can stand by me and
The gift you gave to me
Has changed my life

Love will bring us back
Love will bring us back
Love will bring us back
Love will bring us back
Back a new day
Back a new day
Back a new day
Back a new day
