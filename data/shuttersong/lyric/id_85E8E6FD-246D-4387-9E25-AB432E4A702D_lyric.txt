I want to go back, forget that it's over
Painted in black, when you left me alone
I never knew, she was sleeping next door
With the kid I grew up with, and I can't go back to her
Anymore, no more

You tell me you were happier within, you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you push me away
But then you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
No, I can't lift the weight

Put you in the past, try to forget you cause it's over
And every time you ask I'll pretend I'm okay
You're inside my head
In the middle of the night when I don't feel right
I dream I can hold you, and I can't go back to you anymore, yeah, yeah

You tell me you were happier within, you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you push me away
But then you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
But, I can't lift the weight, and I can't lift the weight

And I can't lift the weigh, no I can't lift the weight
Yeah, you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
And I can't lift the weigh, no I can't lift the weight
Yeah, you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
And I can't lift the weigh, no I can't lift the weight
Yeah, you lower your standards and I raise the stakes
And I can't lift the weigh, no I can't lift the weight

You tell me you were happier within but you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you, you push me away
But then you try to take it back, my heavy heart just breaks
But, I can't lift the weight, and I can't lift the weight

You tell me you were happier within, you want me to stay
You told me that you needed time but you, you push me away
And then you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
Say someday you will change, but I don't wanna wait
