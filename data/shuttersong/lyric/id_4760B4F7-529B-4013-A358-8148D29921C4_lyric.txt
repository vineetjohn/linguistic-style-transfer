What about sunrise

What about rainWhat about all the things
That you said we were to gain...
What about killing fields
Is there a time
What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine...
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before
Did you ever stop this notice
This crying Earth this weeping shore
Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooo

Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooo

Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooo

What have we done to the world

Look what we've done

What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son...

What about flowering fields

Is there a time
What about all the dreams
That you said was yours and mine...
Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth this weeping shore
Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooo
Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooo
Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooo
I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know we've drifted far
Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooo
Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooo
Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooo
Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooo
Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooo
Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooo

What about the seas
(What about us)
The heavens are falling down
(What about us)

What about the holy land
(What about it)
Torn apart by creed
(What about us)
What about the common man
(What about us)

Can't we set him free
(What about us)
What about children dying
(What about us)
Can't you hear them cry

(What about us)
Where did we go wrong
(Oooh, oooh)
Someone tell me why
(What about us)
What about babies
(What about it)
What about the days
(What about us)
What about all their joy
(What about us)
What about the man
(What about us)
What about the crying man
(What about us)
What about Abraham
(What about us)
What about death again

Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooo
Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooo
