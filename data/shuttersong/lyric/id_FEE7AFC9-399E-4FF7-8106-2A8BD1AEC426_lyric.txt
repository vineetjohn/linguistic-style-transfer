Baby I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down eat you alive
Just like animals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals
Baby I'm-

So what you trying to do to me
It's like we can't stop, we're enemies
But we get along when I'm inside you
You're like a drug that's killing me
I cut you out entirely
But I get so high when I'm inside you


Yeah you can start over, you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me, but no



So if I run it's not enough
You're still in my head, forever stuck
So you can do what you wanna do
I love your lies, I'll eat 'em up
But don't deny the animal
That comes alive when I'm inside you



Don't tell no lies, you can't deny
The beast inside
No girl don't lie, you can't deny
The beast inside
Just like animals
Just like animals


This is pain, this is love
This is sent from above
This a gift from the Gods
This was meant to be
You can run, you can hide
You can front, you can lie
But in time you gon' find you was meant for me
You apart of me and I'm apart of you
I'm addicted, one hit won't do I need a lot of you
Overdosing, your potion has got me floating on cloud nine
Tell me what I'm supposed to do when I run out of you, I'm through
I need a fix like d-boys need bricks
And plus whips to transport 'em
J. Cole, I seen it tall, you can't short 'em
One more time together
I hope your new man don't mind, girl you're mine forever
