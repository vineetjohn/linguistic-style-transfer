 But these bitches getting obnoxious
They nothin' to me though I love this shit
Go long days, longer nights
Talk too much, the wrong advice
All the lights, and call my life
Doctor, doctor, will you help me
Keep me healthy, keep it low, this where hell be
Ain't shit you can tell me now
Fuck this rap shit,  bitch I'm sellin' out
Ooh shit, with my new  bitch you jealous now
Smokin' weed at the crib watching Belly now
All the pain that they causin' like fuck it 
we ballin' now everythin' straight
You feeling the feeling, 
I'm chilling, just living, I'm living away
Conversations we having, 
I'm  getting too static, too much on my plate
Lord, I need me a break
 But I be good by the weekend
I be good by the weekend
Everything good by the weekend
Everything will be good by the weekend
We going out tonight, 
yeah we going out tonight, like fuck it
We going out tonight, 
yeah we going out tonight, fuck it
We going out tonight, 
yeah we going out tonight
We going out tonight, 
yeah we going out tonight
I been having trouble sleeping
Battling  these demons
Wondering what's the thing that keeps me breathing
Is it money, fame or neither
I been thinking about the places that I frequent
All the people that I see
I¡¯m just out here livin' decent
What do it mean to be a G
And all the time we fall behind, 
 bitches in the concubine, I call her mine, crazy
She ain't' God as I, 
I make water wine, pause in time
It's common, they often hate me
Never will I walk in line, 
I cross the T's and dot the I's
Wondering well, wonderin' how I got this high
Fell asleep and forgot to die, god damn
I'm poppin' them downers and drinkin' them powders, faded
 Get it over the counter, 
I'm stuck on the browsers like how did I make it
 These  bitches don't know me, 
this shit is so lonely until she  get naked
Don't even know what today is
 But I be good by the weekend
I be good by the weekend
Everything good by the weekend
Everything will be good by the weekend
Mondays I think of you
 But I ain¡¯t tripping on it
Tuesdays I¡¯m in
Gotta  get my hands up on ya
Wednesdays I live with you
You know you're staying over
Thursdays I¡¯m sick of you
I got to  get rid of you
Cause Fridays are always the start of the time of my life, alright
When I  get faded you hate it  but, 
baby, it¡¯s gon be alright, 
ha, alright
