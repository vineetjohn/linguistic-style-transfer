I ain't got no money
I ain't like those other guys you hang around
And it's kinda funny
But they always seem to let you down
And I get discouraged
'cause I never see you anymore
And I need your love, babe yeah
That's all I'm living for, yeah
I didn't wanna pressure you, baby
But all I ever wanted to do
I wanna be your lover
I wanna be the only one that makes you come running
I wanna be your lover
I wanna turn you on, turn you out, all night long, make you shout
Oh, lover! Yeah
I wanna be the only one you come for
I wanna be your brother
I wanna be your mother and your sister, too
There ain't no other
That can do the things that I'll do to you
And I get discouraged
'cause you treat me just like a child
And they say I'm so shy, yeah
But with you I just go wild!
I didn't wanna pressure you, baby. No!
But all I ever wanted to do
I wanna be your lover
I wanna be the only one that makes you come running
I wanna be your lover
I wanna turn you on, turn you out, all night long make you shout
Oh, lover! Yeah
I wanna be the only one you come for, yeah
