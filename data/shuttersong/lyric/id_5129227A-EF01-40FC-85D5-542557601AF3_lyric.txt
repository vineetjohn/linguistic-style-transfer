I can give you what you want.
I can make your heart beat short.
I can make you ice cream,
we could be a sweet team,
melting in your vice dreams, sport.

I can be the sauce you crave.
I can spell what you can't say.
Chocolate flavored love theme,
treat that treats you so mean,
covering your nights and days.

Let me give you what you'd like.
I can make you mouth run dry.
Drink me like a liquor,
c'mon and dip your dipper,
show me what you're here for, guy.

I can give you what you want.
I can make your back real taut.
Fantastic flavored fancies,
sick like Sid and Nancy,
wicked as a joy ride jaunt.

What you want.
I can give you what u want. x4
