Mr. Worldwide to infinity
You know the roof on fire
We gon' boogie, oogie, oggi, jiggle, wiggle and
dance
Like the roof on fire
We gon' drink, drinks and take shots until we fall out
Like the roof on fire
Now baby get that booty naked
Take off all your clothes, and light
the roof on fire
Tell her, tell her baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm on fire
I tell her baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm a fireball
Fireball
I saw, I came, I conquered
Or should I say, I saw, I conquered, I came
This little chico on fire and he no liar
While y'all slippin' he's runnin' the game
Now big bang boogie, Get that kitty little noogie
In a nice, nice little shade
I gave Suzie a little pat up on the booty
And she turned around and said, Walk this way...
I was born in a flame
Mama said that everyone would know my name
I'm the best you never had
If you think I'm burning out, I never am
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
Fireball
Fireball
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But I don't care what y'all say
'Cause as the world turns, y'all boys gon' learn
That chico right here don't play
That boy's from the bottom, bottom of the map
M.I.A.U.S.A.
I gave Suzie a little pat up on the booty
And she turned around and said, Walk this way...
I was born in a flame
Mama said that everyone would know my name

If you think I'm burning out, I never am
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
