There was one and there were two,
and then I probably lost the count.
But I cant even see their faces
cant remember how they sound,
And the sweetest of their smell was
always something kind off dark.
Thats the good love coming for you,
it will give you good advice,

He shook me like nobody, fooled me like nobody,
nobody, nobody, nobody ever does
He shook me like nobody, fooled me like nobody,
nobody, nobody, nobody ever does

And all the boys and all the girls are doing fine.
Cause they have trust and
don't need to pray for all their lives
But older people seem to worry they feel sorry for a time,
If only I could find the way I could be sleeping by your side,
by your side, oh your side is home to me.

He shook me like nobody, fooled me like nobody,
nobody, nobody, nobody ever does
He shook me like nobody, fooled me like nobody,
nobody, nobody, nobody ever does

Oh you shook me, you still fool me
Everyday, everyday, everyday
There was one and there were two
and then I probably lost the count
