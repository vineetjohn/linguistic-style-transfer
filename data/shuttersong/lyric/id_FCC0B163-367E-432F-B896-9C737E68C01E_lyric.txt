Now I'm of consenting age

To be forgetting you in a cabaret

Somewhere downtown where a burlesque queen

May even ask my name

As she sheds her skin on stage

I'm seated and sweating to a dance song on the club's PA

And the strip joint veteran sits two away

Smirking between dignified sips of his dignified peach and lime daiquiri

And isn't this exactly where you'd like me?

I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know

Praying for love in a lap dance

And paying in naivety

Oh, isn't this exactly where you'd like me?

I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know

Praying for love in a lap dance

And paying in naivety

Oh, but I'm afraid that I, well I may have faked it

And I wouldn't be caught dead d-dead d-dead d-dead in this place

Well, I'm afraid that I, well that's right, well I may have faked it

And I wouldn't be caught dead in this place

And isn't this exactly where you'd like me?

I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know

Praying for love in a lap dance

And paying in naivety

Oh, isn't this exactly where you'd like me?

I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know

Praying for love in a lap dance

And paying in naivety

Well, I'm afraid that I, well I may have faked it

And I wouldn't be caught dead d-dead d-dead d-dead in this place

Well, I'm afraid that I, well that's right, well I may have faked it

And I wouldn't be caught dead in this place

And isn't this exactly where you'd like me?

I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know

Praying for love in a lap dance

And paying in naivety

Oh, isn't this exactly where you'd like me?

I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know

Praying for love in a lap dance

And paying in naivety

Praying for love and paying in naivety

Praying for love and paying in naivety, oh
