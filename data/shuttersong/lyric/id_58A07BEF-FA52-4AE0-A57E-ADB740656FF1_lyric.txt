Step out into the Indian dust
I can feel the cracks in my spirit
They're starting to bust

Drive by your house, nobody's home
I'm trying to tell myself that I'm better off alone

All of my friends say I should move on
She's just another girl, don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
And of all my friends say it wasn't meant to be
and it's a great big world, she's just another girl

I went to see a fortuneteller, that was a trip
Maybe this confusion's got me losing my grip
I can't believe you're out there flying with somebody else

Now Jason's getting married in the blink of an eye
I got an invitation but I didn't reply
Tell your little brother that we put down the gloves
and give him all of my love

All of my friends say I should move on
She's just another girl, don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
And all of my friends say it wasn't meant to be
and it's a great big world, she's just another girl

I could be reeling them in left and right
something's got a hold on me, tonight
Well maybe all of my friends should confront
The fact that I don't want another girl

All of my friends say I should move on
All of my friends say
All of my friends say
All of my friends say
She's just another girl

Now why can't I sleep at night
and why don't the moon look right
the sounds up, the TV's on
and it's a great big world
She's just another girl
don't let her stick it to your heart, boy
She's just another girl
all of my friends say she's just another girl
Another girl
