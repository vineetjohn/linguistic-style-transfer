Cut me open and tell me what's inside
Diagnose me 'cause I can't keep wondering why
And no it's not a phase 'cause it happens all the time
Start over, check again, now tell me what you find

'Cause I'm going out of frequency
Can anyone respond?

It's like an avalanche
I feel myself go under
'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance
My heart has frozen over
And I feel like I am treading on thin ice

Am I broken? What's the chance I will survive?
Don't sugarcoat me 'cause I feel like suicide
Just give it to me straight 'cause I'm running out of time
I need an antidote, now what can you prescribe?
It's like an avalanche

I feel myself go under
'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance
My heart has frozen over
And I feel like I am treading on thin ice
And I'm going under

I need a cure for me 'cause the square doesn't fit the circle

Give me a remedy 'cause my head wasn't wired for this world
I need a cure for me cause a square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy cause my head wasn't wired for this world
'Cause I'm going out of frequency

Can anyone respond?

Give me a remedy 'cause my head wasn't wired for this world
I need a cure for me 'cause the square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy 'cause when it hits
Well it hits like an avalanche
