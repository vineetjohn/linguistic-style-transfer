Ay, bitch
We ain't got much
We ain't living lavish
Dirty beamer our fronts
Shall we had a party, didn't run it by moms
DJ acting shy, tell him turn that shit up
The kids next door, they couldn't sleep cause it thumps
So the police shut it down but at least we had fun
Joey's with Rebecca getting flirty on punch
DJ acting shy, tell him turn that shit up

Ain't life so fancy, ain't life so fun?
Fine if you ask me, yeah t's all love
Plenty opinions, but I keep it hush
I don't say nothing, cause nothing's enough

Don't speak your mind, be a good girl, baby
Momma told me tie my hair back all the way
Bubbly lives, better sit real pretty
Momma told me tie my hair back all the way
I'd rather be reckless, too young and dumb
I'm old Dirty Harry, but I Dont
Don't speak your mind, be a good girl, baby
Momma told me tie my hair back all the way

Madness, we just have fun
He just rock a tee that got The Beatles on the front
Told me let it be and put some diesel in my trunk
Now I'm riding through the city, baby, turn that shit up

I get my best shot and lately I ain't miss once
He don't say he love me, he just try to act dumb
If you make your bed, then you gotta sleep once

Don't speak your mind, be a good girl, baby
Momma told me tie my hair back all the way
Bubbly lives, better sit real pretty
Momma told me tie my hair back all the way
I'd rather be reckless, too young and dumb
I'm old Dirty Harry, but I Dont
Don't speak your mind, be a good girl, baby
Momma told me tie my hair back all the way
