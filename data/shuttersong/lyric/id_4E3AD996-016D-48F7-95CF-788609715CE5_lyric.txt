Imagine holding Planet Earth
In the palm of your hand
With no regard for your place of birth
Or claim to any land

The only thing between us now is the truth we understand
If Planet Earth was in the palm of your hand

50 years from now what will they say about us here?
Did we care for the water and the fragile atmosphere?

There are only 2 kinds of folk
And the difference they make
The ones that give
And the ones that take

Just like the countless bodies
That revolve around the sun
Planet Earth must now come into balance with the one,
That caused it all to be
Then we'll see His kingdom come,
So shall it be written, shall be sung

Imagine you could rid the Earth
Of anyone you choose
Which ones would you need the most
And which ones would you lose?

Do we want to judge another
Lest we be judged too?
Careful now... The next one might be you


Just like the countless bodies
That revolve around the sun
Planet Earth must now come into balance with the one,
That caused it all to be
Then we'll see His kingdom come,
So shall it be written, shall be sung

Imagine sending your first born
Off to fight a war
With no good reason how it started and what they are fighting for
And if they're blessed to make it home
Will they still be poor?

Pray for peace right now and forever more

Just like the countless bodies
That revolve around the sun
Planet Earth must now come into balance with the one,
That caused it all to be
Then we'll see His kingdom come,
So shall it be written, shall be sung

Just like the countless bodies
That revolve around the sun
Planet Earth must now come into balance with the one,
That caused it all to be
Then we'll see His kingdom come,
So shall it be written, shall be sung
