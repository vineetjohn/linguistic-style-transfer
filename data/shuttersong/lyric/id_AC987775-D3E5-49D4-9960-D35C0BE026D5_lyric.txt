You know today I just woke up and I said

You know instead of waitin' on a good day
Waitin' around through up's and down's waitin
On something to happen I just say

We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy,
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today

Cause ain't nobody gonna die today

Save that drama for another day

Heyyy we're gonna have a good day

Hairline fresh, new cologne on
Feelin' so good changed the color to my phone
Orange kool-aid go good with patron
A naw hell naw boy still my ring tones
Free car wash had to clean up the dodge
Get back when I can just playin' my part

Church folk had a fish fry

Mustard, hot sauce, light bread, and french fries
Love for the big guy

Hit the park, boys showin' off their hops
Nappy Roots on the radio and you know it bops

Last night I hit the pick tree bought some Air Force ones
4 tall tees man I love the Begees

We're gonna have

We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day

And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today

Heyyy,
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today

Cause ain't nobody gonna die today

Save that drama for another day
Heyyy we're gonna have a good day

We're gonna have a good day
And I fin to worry bout what noboy say
I'm still above ground that's the reason I pray
Got my car cleaned up now I'm ready to play

Make call to the sticks say I'm headin' dat way
Heard my cousin cookin out I gotta get me a plate
Got new outfit ain't even out in the states

So if they ain't speakin' to soon but this is a hell of a day

And these dickies got me sitin' in a hell of a place
Got my stunna shades on and grin on my face

My grill looks mean but I swear I'm straight
And the hood showin' love so I'm a okay

We're gonna have
We're gonna have

We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today

And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy,

We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today

Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
Save that drama for another day
Heyyy we're gonna have a good day

We might as well do what the children sayin'
Take a day off hit park and just hang

Barbque roll a few and put up your dukes
If it's beef put down the peace up and put down your dukes
It's time to change our ways
So we can save the day
For the children sake and make a better place to play
And if it's all good break out your click and grip your wood
And if you ridin' dirty just light your swift and blow yor sss...
But dot real big exactly like a player should
Enjoy your 24's do your thang and rep your hood
The world is all yours
But still we all bound forever
In a day the choice you make is relly all fine

We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy,
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
Save that drama for another day
Heyyy we're gonna have a good day
