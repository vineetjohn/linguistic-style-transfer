You terrify me, cuz you're a man, you're not a boy
You got some power, and I can't treat you like a toy
You're the road less travelled by a little girl
You disregard the mess while I try to control the world
Don't leave me, stay here and frighten me
Don't leave me, come now enlighten me
Give me all you got, give me your wallet and your watch
Give me your first-born, give me the rainbow and the…

So go and challenge me, take the reigns and see
Watch me squirm baby, but you are just what I need

And I've never played a fair game
I've always had the upper hand
But what good is intellect and airplay
If I can't respect any man
Yeah I want to play a fair game
Yeah I want to play a fair game

You terrify me, we've still not kissed and yet I've cried
You got too close and I pushed and pushed hoping you'd bite
So I could run, run and that I did but through the dust
You saw those teeth marks, they weren't all yours you had been trust
Into a history, that had not worked for me
Into a history, from which I could not flee
So go on shake me, shake until I give it up
Wearing me down baby, I know that we could make some love

So go and challenge me, take the reigns and see
Watch me squirm baby, but you are just what I need

And I've never played a fair game
I've always had the upper hand
But what good is intellect and airplay
If I can't respect any man
Yeah I want to play a fair game
Yeah I want to play a fair game
And I've never played a fair game
I've always had the upper hand
But what good is intellect and airplay
If I can't respect any man
I want to play a fair game
Oh I've never played a fair game
(I've always had the upper hand)
But what good is intellect and airplay
(If I can't respect any man)
Yeah I want to play a fair game
Yeah I want to play a fair game
