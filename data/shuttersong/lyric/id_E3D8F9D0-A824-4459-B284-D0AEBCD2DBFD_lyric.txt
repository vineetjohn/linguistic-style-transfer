The dawn is breaking
A light shining through
You're barely waking
And I'm tangled up in you

Yeah
I'm open, you're closed
Where I follow, you'll go
I worry I won't see your face

Light up again
Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills my mind

I somehow find

You and I collide
I'm quiet you know
You make a first impression
I've found I'm scared to know I'm always on your mind

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the stars refuse to shine
Out of the back you fall in time
I somehow find

You and I collide
Don't stop here
I lost my place

I'm close behind
Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills your mind
You finally find
You and I collide
You finally find
You and I collide
You finally find
You and I collide
