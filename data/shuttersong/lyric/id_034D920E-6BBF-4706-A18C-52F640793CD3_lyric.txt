Let me be your air
Let me roam your body freely
No inhibition, no fear

Is it like the ocean?
What devotion are you?

Is it like Nirvana?
Hit me harder, again
How deep is your love?

Pull me closer, again
How deep is your love?

Open up my eyes and
Tell me who I am
Let me in on all your secrets
No inhibition, no sin
