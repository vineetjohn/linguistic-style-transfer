Little Things - One Direction
Your hand fits in mine  like it's made just for me 
But bear this in mind it was meant to be 
And I'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks 
And it all makes sense to me 
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you you smile 
You've never loved your stomach or your thighs 
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine 
But I'll love them endlessly 
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth 
But if I do  it's you 
Oh it's you they add up to 
I'm in love with you  and all these little things 
You can't go to bed without a cup of tea 
Maybe that's the reason you talk in your sleep 
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep 
Though it makes no sense to me 
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape 
You never want to know how much you weigh 
You still have to squeeze into your jeans 
But you're perfect to me 
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth 
But if it's true  it's you 
It's you they add up to 
I'm in love with you  and all these little things 
You'll never love yourself half as much as I love you 
You'll never treat yourself right darling 
But I want you to 
If I let you know I'm here for you 
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you oh 
And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth 
Cause it's you  oh it's you  it's you they add up to 
And I'm in love with you and all these little things 
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth 
But if it's true  it's you 
It's you they add up to 
I'm in love with you  and all these your things
