Ended up on a crossroad
Try to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now

Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Who'll show you grace?
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out

He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
With a long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living

Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in

Life is worth living again

Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow

Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart is just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent us an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead

Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness

People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again

What I'd give for my affection
Is a different perception
From what the world may see

They try to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Life is worth living again
