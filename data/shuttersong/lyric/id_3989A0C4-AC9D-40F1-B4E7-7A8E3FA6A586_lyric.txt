Here's to you
You were pink or blue
And everything I wanted
Here's to you
Never sleeping through
From midnight till the morning
Had to crawl before you walked
Before you ran
Before I knew it

You were trying to free your fingers from my hand
‘Cause you could it on your own now Somehow

Slow down
Won't you stay here a minute more
I know you want to walk through the door
But it's all too fast
Let's make it last a little while
I pointed to the sky and now you wanna fly

I am your biggest fan
I hope you know I am
But do you think you can somehow Slow down

Here's to you
Every missing tooth
Every bedtime story
Here's to Barbie cars, light saber wars
Sleeping in on Sunday
Had to crawl
Before you walked
Before you ran
Before I knew it

You were teaching me
The only thing love can
Hold hands through it
When it's scary, you've got me

Please don't roll your eyes at me
I know I'm embarrassing
But someday you'll understand
You'll hold a little hand
Ask them if they can …
I am your biggest fan
I hope you know I am
But do you think you can
Somehow
Slow down
