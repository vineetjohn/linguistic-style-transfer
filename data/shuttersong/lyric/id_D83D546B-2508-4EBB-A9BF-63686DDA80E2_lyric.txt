I never needed love
Like I need you
And I never lived for nobody
But I live for you
Ooh babe
Lost in love is what I feel
When I'm with you

Maybe it's the way you touch me
With the warmth of the sun
Maybe it's the way you smile
I come all undone
Ooh babe
Lost in love is what I feel
When I'm with you

Baby ooh I get chills when I'm with you oh
Oh baby my world stands still when I'm with you
When I'm with you

I never cared for nobody
Like I care for you
And I never wanted to share the things
I want to share with you
Ooh babe
Lost in love is what I feel
When I'm with you

Baby ooh I get chills when I'm with you oh
O baby my world stands still when I'm with you oh oh
Baby ooh I get chills when I'm with you oh
O baby my world stands still when I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
