Today I need You
Just to get through
Today I’m breaking under the weight of it all
And I’m afraid I might fall
Today I’m empty
But I am willing
To keep listening and looking for You in the noise
For Your quiet voice

Are You telling me to go?
Are You telling me to stay?
Are You telling me to hold on to You for another day?
‘Cause I got nothing left
And I’m hanging by a thread
I give You all my weakness, You give me Your strength
‘Cause I’m here again, here at my end
Where You begin

I’ve seen broken
Turn into beauty
I’ve seen redemption
Come in and save the day
So I don’t have to be afraid, no

When You’re telling me to go
When You’re telling me to stay
When You’re telling me to hold on to You for another day
When I got nothing left
When I’m hanging by a thread
I give You all my weakness, You give me Your strength
Yeah, I’m here again, here at my end
Where You begin
Jesus, You make all things new
So I will trust in You

Are You telling me to go?
Are You telling me to stay?
Are You telling me to hold on to You for another day?
‘Cause I got nothing left
And I’m hanging by a thread
I give You all my weakness, You give me Your strength
‘Cause I’m here again, here at my end
Where You begin
Where You begin
