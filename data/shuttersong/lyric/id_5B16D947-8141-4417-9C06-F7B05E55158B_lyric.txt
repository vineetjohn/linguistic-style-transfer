Do you want to go
to the Plage with me?
I'm going down-down-down there;
four in the morning,
most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
Calm down-down-down
my love is calling.

And I will love your heart with mine.

Calm down-down-down

It's half-past the moonlight.
Nobody would see us go.
(And I wonder)
If maybe you will look into my eyes
and you will see just what you done to me.

Time is short.
You know you live one life.
It was love at first sight.

And being by your side is the only thing on my mind
So...
Do you want to go
to the plage with me?

And I will love your heart with mine.
