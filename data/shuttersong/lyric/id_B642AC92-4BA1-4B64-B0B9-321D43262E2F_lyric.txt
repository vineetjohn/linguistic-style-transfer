You think you’re ballin cause you got a block?
He think he ballin cause he got a block?
You know these hoes came to see me ball
You know these hoes love to see me ball

You think you’re ballin cause you got a block?
He think he ballin cause he got a block?
You know these hoes love to see me ball
You know these hoes came to see me ball

[Young Jeezy - Verse 1]
Hopped up out the bed, I think my roof gone
Think I forgot to put my roof on
Said “fuck it, buy another car”
Hopped out the Lamb’
Said “fuck it, bought another car”
I bought the Phantom just to say it’s black
I bought the Phantom just to take a nap
I’m getting head in the backseat
I might stop and stand it tall like a athlete
I’m ballin’ hard, I need a jersey on
So much bread on me, I can buy a Jersey home
I’m on them Diddy’s, spendin’ Dirty Money
I’m on that Jizzle, spendin’ my money

[Young Jeezy - Hook]

[Young Jeezy - Verse 2]
Still ballin’ like a muthafucker, tell ‘em that
Three platinum chains to match my platinum plaques
Ain’t got nuttin’ gold but some gold chains
Say “Jizzle, what’s the dough?”
Move the whole thang
My celly bumpin’ like a chat line
He bought a 500, need he, need a halftime
If yo job ain’t ballin’ hard, then you need to quit
You need a A T hard, then you need to split
Summer’s mine, winter too
I’m poppin’ bottles in the club, that’s what winners do
They claiming bitches, them my old hoes
They claim they ballin’ in my old flows

[Young Jeezy - Hook]

[Lil Wayne]
These hoes call me Tunechi baby
Niggas think they seeing me, they hallucinating
Bitch, I’m ballin’, ballin’ like a muthafucker
12 gauge, bitch, I got a dozen of them
Nigga broke, acting like he got it though
I’m with a Spanish bitch, if she ain't fucking, adios!
So many cars I’m like eenie meenie minie moe
So many colours in the diamonds, Kaleidoscope
Last year I made a hundred million dollars flat
Run in ya house, and get to poppin’ at your shower cap
My homies got them firebirds like Pontiac
And if them bitches don’t sell, we buy em back
Where the strippers, tell em Tune on his way
Tell them niggas I’m strapped like lingerie
I ain't trippin, I’m ballin, call me NBA
I-I ain't trippin, I’m ballin, call me NBA

[Young Jeezy - Chorus x2]
You think you’re ballin cause you got a block?
He think he ballin cause he got a block?
You know these hoes came to see me ball
You know these hoes love to see me ball

[Lil Wayne]
You think you’re ballin cause you got a block?
He think he ballin cause he got a block?
