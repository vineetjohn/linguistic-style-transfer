When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, oh, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And, you know, wherever I am
I'll come running (oh yeah, baby)
To see you again

Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you've got to do is call
And I'll be there, (yeah yeah yeah)
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Should turn dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind should begin to blow

Keep your head together
And call my name out loud now
Soon I'll be knocking upon your door

You just call out my name
And, you know, wherever I am
I'll come running (Oh, yes I will)
To see you again

Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you've got to do is call
And I'll be there, yeah yes

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold?
They'll hurt you and desert you
Well, they'll take your soul if you let them
Oh, but don't you let them

You just call out my name
And, you know, wherever I am
I'll come running
To see you again
(Oh baby don't you know 'bout)
Winter, spring, summer or fall
(Hey Now) All you've got to do is call
Lord I'll be there, yes I will
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
