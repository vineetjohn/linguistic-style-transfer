Yeah, yeah, yeah
We don't believe what's on TV
Because it's what we want to see
And what we want we know we can't believe

We have all learned to kill our dreams
I need to know
That when I fail

You'll still be here
'Cause if you stick around
I'll sing you pretty sounds
And we'll make money selling your hair

I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you I might think twice
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

(Alright, second verse)

What if my dream does not happen?
Would I just change what I've told my friends?

Don't wanna know who I would be
When I wake up from a dreamer's sleep
I need to know
That when I fail
You'll still be here
'Cause if you stick around
I'll sing you pretty sounds
And we'll make money selling your hair
But I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you I might think twice
I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you I might think twice
Yeah, yeah, yeah
