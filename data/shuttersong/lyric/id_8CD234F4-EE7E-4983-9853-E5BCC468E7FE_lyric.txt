- Merry Christmas, ladies

- Merry Christmas, Mr. Buble

- Are you ready to sing a little Jingle Bells?

- Yeeeees

 

Jingle bells, jingle bells

Jingle all the way

Oh, what fun it is to ride

In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells

Jingle all the way

Oh, what fun it is to ride

In a one horse open sleigh

 

Dashing through the snow

In a one horse open sleigh

O'er the fields we go

Laughing all the way

Bells on bob tail ring

Making spirits bright

What fun it is to ride and sing

A sleighing song tonight

 

Jingle bells, j-jingle bells

Jingle all the way

Oh, what fun it is to ride

In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, j-j-j-jingle bells

Jingle all the way

Oh, what a lotta fun, what a lotta fun to ride and sing

In a one horse open sleigh

 

Dashing through the snow (we are dashing)

In a one horse open sleigh (one horse sleigh)

O'er the fields we go (o'er the fields we go, we go)

Laughing all the way (all the way)

Bells on bob tail ring

Making spirits bright

What fun it is to ride and sing

A sleighing song tonight

 

Jingle bells, jingle bells

Jingle all the way

Oh, what fun it is to ride

In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells

Jingle all the way

Oh, what fun it is to ride

In a one horse open sleigh

 

Jingle bells, jingle bells

Oh, what fun in one horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells

Oh, what fun it is to ride

In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells

Jingle all the way
