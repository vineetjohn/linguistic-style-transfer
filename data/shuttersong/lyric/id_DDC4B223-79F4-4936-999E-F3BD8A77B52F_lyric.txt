Oh baby, baby

Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby

How was I supposed to know
That somethin' wasn't right here?

Oh baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go

And now you're out of sight, yeah
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now what we got
My loneliness is killin' me (And I)
I must confess I still believe (Still believe)

When I'm not with you I lose my mind

Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
Oh baby, baby the reason I breathe is you

Boy, you got me blinded
I'll bet you baby there's nothing that I wouldn't do

It's not the way I planned that
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now what we got

My loneliness is killin' me (And I)
I must confess I still believe (Still believe)

When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby how was I supposed to know?
Oh pretty baby I shouldn't have let you go
I must confess that my loneliness is killin' me now
Don't you know I still believe?
That you will be here and give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
My loneliness is killing me (And I)
I must confess I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time, I must confess that my loneliness is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe?
That you will be here and give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
