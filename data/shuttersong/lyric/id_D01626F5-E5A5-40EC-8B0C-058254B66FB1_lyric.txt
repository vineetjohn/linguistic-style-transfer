Got a secret
Can you keep it?
Swear this one you'll save
Better lock it in your pocket
Taking this one to the grave
If I show you then I know you won't tell what I said

'Cause two can keep a secret if one of them is dead
Why do you smile like you've been told a secret?
Now you're telling lies 'cause you have sworn to keep it

But no one keeps a secret
No one keeps a secret
Why when do our darkest deeds do we tell?

They burn in our brains, become a living hell
Cause everybody tells
Everybody tells
Got a secret
Can you keep it?

Swear this one you'll save
Better lock it in your pocket
Taking this one to the grave
If I show you then I know you won't tell what I said
'Cause two can keep a secret if one of them is dead

Look into my eyes
Now you're getting sleepy
Are you hypnotized by secrets that you're keeping?
I know what you're keeping
I know what you're keeping

Got a secret

Can you keep it?
Swear this one you'll save
Better lock it in your pocket
Taking this one to the grave
If I show you then I know you won't tell what I said

'Cause two can keep a secret if one of them is dead

Allison?

Yes, Catherine?
I have something I want to tell you but
you have to promise never to tell anyone.
I promise.
Do you swear on your life?
I swear on my life.
You swore you'd never tell

You swore you'd never tell
You swore you'd never tell
You swore you'd never tell
Got a secret
Can you keep it?
