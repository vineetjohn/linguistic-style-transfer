All I Want For Christmas Is You - Justin Bieber/Mariah Carey
Written by£ºMariah Carey/Walter Afanasieff
I just can't wait
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas
Is you
You  baby
Oh  I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
And I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do 
Cause baby all I want for Christmas is you
You
Oh-ho  all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need 
Won't you please bring my baby to me 
Yeah
Oh  I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby Yeahhh
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want you for my own
For my own
Baby
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is
You baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby
