I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air like I don't care baby by the way
Because I¡¯m happy

Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
