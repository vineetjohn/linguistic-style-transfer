Count On Me (feat  Moko)-Chase & Status
I know
I know
I know
I know
I will be there for you
All this love that I am giving
Can it ever be enough
Let¡¯s go back to the beginning
Will it be the end of us
Give me a sign 
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you need
Throw my hands up high and surrender
You can count on me 
You can count on me 
I know
I know
I know
I know
I will be there for you
Cheating hearts  lying eyes  broken promises
I heard them all  but they never hurt like this
I¡¯m in the dark when we¡¯re a?art
And I miss the way you look right through me
No one else can move me
Give me a sign 
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you need
Throw my hands up high and surrender
You can count on me 
You can count on me 
I know
I know
I know
I know
I will be there for you
Oh baby
I  I 
I  I 
Oh baby
I know
I know
I know
I know
I will be there for you
Give me a sign 
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you need
Throw my hands up high and surrender
You can count on me 
You can count on me 
I know
I know
I know
I never knew what I could feel
I will be there for you
I know
We got eachother baby
I know
We got eachother baby
I know
We got eachother baby
I know
I will be there for you
