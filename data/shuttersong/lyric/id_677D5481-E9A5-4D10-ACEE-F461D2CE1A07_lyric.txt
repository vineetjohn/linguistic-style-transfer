You can't hurt me this time,
I'm prepared for anything
You won't get that close now
I'm protected from your lies
Knowing what you will bring me
Knowing that I want no more, more

When the snow was falling
I could see your footprints
Right outside my window
You were watching all night long
Standing there in the shadows
Whispering my name in your spell

Won't fall again
I won't be fooled
This time my heart is strong
You are standing right before
The master of sorrow

Won't feel again
Suffer no more
This time my heart is cold
You are standing right before
The master of sorrow

Yeah¡­ I am the master of sorrow

Fells like yesterday now
I can see it all so clear
You were closer whispering
It's you and me that count right now
I thought that the voice I was hearing
Was so completely sincere
years have passed since that day
My mourning has come to an end
I know you're still out there
Regretting the choices that you made
I won't follow you this time
I'll give you the pain that was mine

You are standing right before

Won't fall again
I won't be fooled
This time my heart is strong
You are standing right before
The master of sorrow

Won't feel again
Suffer no more
This time my heart is cold
You are standing right before
The master of sorrow

Won't fall again
I won't be fooled
This time my heart is strong
You are standing right before
Master, Master of sorrow

Won't feel again
Suffer no more (Yeah)
This time my heart is cold
You are standing right before
You are standing right the $#!@$# master of sorrow

Won't fall again
I won't be fooled
This time my heart is strong
You are standing right before
