
She dances in these sheets at nights
She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep
She dances at the crack of dawn
And quick cooks his food
She can't be late can't take too long
The kids must get to school
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
She works so hard just to make her way
For a man who just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Still she could not stop couldn't break his chains
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But then she did he did not quit as she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home home
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love the rhythm of love
