Josie
You're my source of most frustration
Forget when I don't meet expectations
Everything you wished came true
In the end we all blamed you
Even though, as they all know
You weren't the only one, two three four

Why do you still keep it around
When you know it brings me down
I'm hating everything
And I know that you dated other guys
But I gotta wonder why
You'd leave it out for me(shit!)

Why am I still hanging around
When I know it brings me down
I'm hating everything
And you are getting rides home in his car
You're making out in his front yard
I'm hating everything

Please don't remind me
Put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me
I wish that this would end
And I am not fine
Last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine
Why can't we just pretend

And if we could have another day
I've got so much left to say
I'd tell you everything
And I'll laugh when I think about the past
When I see you after class you're hating everything

Please don't remind me
Put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me
I wish that this would end
And I am not fine
Last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine
Why can't we just pretend

Please don't remind me
Put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me
I wish that this would end
And I am not fine
Last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine
Why can't we just pretend

And she said
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
I just forgot you were there
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
I just forgot you were there
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na...

I just forgot you were there
Please don't remind me
Put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me
I wish that this would end
And I am not fine
Last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine

Why can't we just pretend
Please don't remind me
Put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me
I wish that this would end
And I am not fine
Last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine
Why can't we just pretend
And she said na na na na na...
