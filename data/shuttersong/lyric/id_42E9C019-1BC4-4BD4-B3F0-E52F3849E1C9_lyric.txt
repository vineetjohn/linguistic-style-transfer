See you calling again
I don't wanna pick up, no oh
I've been laying in bed
Probably thinking too much
oh oh
Sorry I'm

not sorry for the times
I don't reply
you know the reason why
Maybe you shouldn't come back
Maybe you shouldn't comeback

to me

Tired of being so sad
tired of getting so mad
baby
Stop right now

you'll only let me down, oh oh
Maybe you shouldn't come back

Maybe you shouldn't come back
to me
Trying not to forget
should be easier than this

oh oh

And all the birthdays you've missed
I was only a kid oh oh

Sorry I'm

not sorry for the times
I don't reply
you know the reason why
Maybe you shouldn't come back
Maybe you shouldn't come back
to me
Tired of being so sad
tired of getting so mad, baby
Stop right now
you'll only let me down, oh oh
Maybe you shouldn't come back
Maybe you shouldn't come back
to me
To me
Sorry I'm not sorry for the times
Maybe you shouldn't come back
Maybe you shouldn't come back
to me
Tired of being so sad
tired of getting so mad, baby
Stop right now
you'll only let me down, oh oh
Maybe you shouldn't come back
Maybe you shouldn't come back
to me
Baby you shouldn't come back
to me
