Boom clap, boom de clap de clap
Boom boom clap, boom de clap de clap
Boom boom clap, boom de clap de clap
Boom boom clap, boom de clap de clap
Try it with me, here we go

Boom boom clap, boom de clap de clap

(That's right!)
Boom boom clap, boom de clap de clap

1, 2, 3!
Everybody come on, off your seats
I'm gonna tell you about a beat
That's gonna make you move your feet

I'll give the BBQ
Show and tell you how to move
If you're 5 or 82
This is something you can do

Pop it, lock it, polka dot it
Country fivin', hip hop hip
Put your hawk in the sky, move side to side
Jump to the left, stick it, glide

Zig zag 'cross the floor
Shuffle in diagonal
When the drum hits hands on your hips
One-footed 180 twist

And then a zig zag, step'n, slide
Lean in left to clap, three times
Shake it out, head to toe
Throw it all together, that's how we roll

Do the hoedown
(Throwdown!)
Do the hoedown
(Throwdown!)
Do the hoedown
(Throwdown!)
Throw it all together, that's how we roll

We get to four, five, six
And you're feelin' busted
But it's not time to quit
Practice makes you perfect

Pop it, lock it, polka dot it
Country fivin', hip hop hip
Put your hawk in the sky, move side to side
Jump to the left, stick it, glide

Zig zag 'cross the floor
Shuffle in diagonal
When the drum hits hands on your hips
One-footed 180 twist

And then a zig zag, step'n, slide
Lean in left to clap, three times
Shake it out, head to toe
Throw it all together, that's how we roll

Do the hoedown
(Throwdown!)
Do the hoedown
(Throwdown!)

Throw it all together, that's how we roll
