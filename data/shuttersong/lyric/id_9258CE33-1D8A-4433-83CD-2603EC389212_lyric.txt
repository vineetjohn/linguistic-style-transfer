She says, "I'm walkin' in a straight line"
That's not really her style
And they all got the same heartbeat
But hers is fallin' behind
Nothing in this world could ever bring them down
Yeah, they're invincible
And she's just in the background

And she says
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids
They seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Like the cool kids

He says, "I'm talkin' with a big smile, but they haven't got a clue"
Yeah, they're livin' the good life
Can't see what he is goin' through
They're drivin' fast cars
But they don't know where they're going

In the fast lane
Livin' life without knowing

And he says
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids
They seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids
They seem to get it
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
