"Cheerleader"
(feat. Samantha J)

Dis ah no mystery check the history
From you hear my voice it's no secret
Cheerleader song make the world sing along
Now Samantha J pon the remix
Me a di a di girl in the tight up skirt
But Omi call me cheerleader
Pompoms in my hand when I'm singing this song
Omi make me turn up the speaker

Say oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She's always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She's always right there when I need her

When I need motivation, my one solution
Is my queen cause she stay strong yeah yeah
She's always in my corner right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting but I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
Do you need me
Do you think I'm pretty
Do I make you feel like cheating
I'm like no not really (nuh uh)

Cause oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She's always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She's always right there when I need her

If it's wrong I don't care I'm a right this
Thinks you do have me flying the highest
Say whatever what you want call me like it
For the haters out there, you can bite this
You gotta know how to
Walk like a model, talk like a model
Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a model
Been looking like say I won the lotto
Everywhere I go, got them off there singing like

Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

She gives me love and affection
Baby did I mention
You're the only girl for me
No I don't need no next one
Mama loves you too
She thinks I made the right selection
All that's left to do is just for me to pop the question

Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
