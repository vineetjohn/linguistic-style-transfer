Oh my sleeping child
The world's so wild
But you built your own paradise
That's one reason why I'll cover you sleeping child.

The milky way upon the heavens
Is twinkling just for you
And mr. moon, he came by
To say goodnight to you.

I sing for you
I sing for mother
We're praying for the world

And for the people everywhere
Gonna show them all we care
Oh my sleeping child
The world's so wild

But you built your own paradise
That's one reason why I'll cover you sleeping child.
If all the people around the world
They had a mind like yours

We'd have no fighting and no wars
There would be lasting peace on earth.
If all the kings and all the leaders

Could see you here this way
They would hold the earth in their arms
They would learn to watch you play.
Oh my sleeping child
The world's so wild
But you built your own paradise
That's one reason why I'll cover you sleeping child.
Cover my child
I'm gonna cover my sleeping child
Keep you away
Keep you away from the world so wild
Keep you away from the world
Away from the world so wild
Oh my sleeping child
The world's so wild
But you built your own paradise
That's one reason why I'll cover you sleeping child
You built your own in paradise.
Oh my sleeping child
The world's so wild
But you built your own paradise
That's one reason why I'll cover you sleeping child.
