For all the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh, girl for goodness' sake
You think I'm crying on my own but I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care, I don't
But you still hit my phone up
And, baby, I be moving on
And I think you should be something I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on
But now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holding on to something
You should go and love yourself

And when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care, I don't
But you still hit my phone up
And, baby, I be moving on
And I think you should be something I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on
But now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holding on to something
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothing at all
And never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holding on to something
You should go and love yourself
Love yourself

(Cause if you like the way you look that much)
You should go and love yourself
Yeah baby
And if you think that I'm still holding on to something
You should go and love yourself
