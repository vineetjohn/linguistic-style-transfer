Oh oh ah my eagle eyes,

My my my eagle eyes

Marching down the street

In my lightning feet

And the shine's too fine to be real

Fake it so I care for the glisten and the glare

And now it's glare

Something I'm starting to feel

Oh oh ah my eagle eyes,

My my my eagle eyes

I caught a glimpse with my eagle eyes

Left it up to the great wide open

To find out the places I'd be

In my sleep they were growing all the time

And now they've grown too far from me

Didn't know how to wait out the ages

So I wrecked my only way through

Blind bravery forgets the wars it wages

But I'll fight just to see if it's true

Left it up to the great wide open

To find out the places I'd be

In my sleep they were growing all the time


Oh oh ah my eagle eyes,

My my my eagle eyes

Oh oh ah my eagle eyes,

My my my eagle eyes

Oh oh ah my eagle eyes,

My my my eagle eyes

Oh oh ah my eagle eyes,

My my my eagle eyes
