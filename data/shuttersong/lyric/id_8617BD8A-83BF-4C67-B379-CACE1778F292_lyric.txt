I'll start this off without any words
I got so high that I scratched 'till I bled

I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

The finest day that I ever had
Was when I learned to cry on command

I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

My brother died every night
It's safe to say, don't quote me on that

I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

The black sheep got blackmailed again
Forgot to put on the zip code

I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory has stored
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?

It is now time to make it unclear
To write off lines that don't make sense

I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

And one more special message to go
And then I'm done, then I can go home

I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
