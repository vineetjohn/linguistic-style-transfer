Yup I'm impressed, Go 'head and flex. (flex! turn up!)
Everybody be hatin' the way that you stealin' the show
'Cause ooh you be killing 'em just like Little Terrio

Ooh you can get it, anything you want (anything you want)
And can't nobody (can't nobody) ever tell you no (no, no!)
Don't need no filters on pictures before you post 'em on the gram
You can shut down the internet they don't even understand

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
They don't make 'em quite like you
No no ooh ooh ooh
It ain't braggin' if you know it's true.

Ooh, where you from
Must be heaven
You'd be rich if looking good was your profession
Think I'm in love, 'cause you so sexy
Boy, I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talking to my own reflection

I'm talking to my own reflection
I'm talking to my own reflection
Boy, I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talking to my own reflection
I'm talking to my own reflection
I'm talking to my own reflection
Boy, I ain't talking 'bout you, I'm talking to my own reflection.

Why you think I'm puttin' on my favorite perfume?
Why you think this dress so tight that I can barely move?
Why you think I'm dancin' in these uncomfortable shoes?
I did it all, I did it all, I did it all for you

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, don't you ever get it confused
No no ooh, ooh ooh
It ain't braggin' if you know it's true.

Ooh, where you from? (where you from?)
Must be heaven
You'd be rich if looking good was your profession
Think I'm in love, 'cause you so sexy
Boy, I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talking to my own reflection

I'm talking to my own reflection
I'm talking to my own reflection
Boy, I ain't talkin' about you
I'm talking to my own reflection
I'm talking to my own reflection
I'm talking to my own reflection
Boy, I ain't talking 'bout you, I'm talking to my own reflection.

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Should I even return his call?
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Should I even return his call?
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Should I even return his call? (Ah ah)
Mirror, mirror on the wall
On the, on the, on-on the wall...

Must be heaven (okay)
You'd be rich if looking good was your profession (cha-ching!)
Think I'm in love, 'cause you so sexy
Boy, I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talking to my own reflection
