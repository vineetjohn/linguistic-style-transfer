Aaaaah
La, da, da
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Coming out your mouth with
Your blah, blah, blah
Zip your lips like a padlock, (Yeah)
And meet me in the back with the Jack
And the jukebox
I don't really care where you live at
Just turn around, boy, let me hit that
Don't be a little bitch with your chit chat
Just show me where your dick's at
Music's up
Listen hot stuff
I'm in love (Love)
With this song
So just hush (Hush)

Baby, shut up (Up)
Heard enough
Stop ta-ta-talking that
Blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be getting this?
Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my
Car-ah-ah
If you keep talking that
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Boy, come on, give me rocks stuff
Come put a little love in my glove bag
Wanna dance with no pants on?
Meet me in the back with the Jack
And the jukebox
So cut to the chase, kid
'Cause I know you don't care
What my middle name is
I wanna be naked
And you're wasted
Music's up
Listen hot stuff
I'm in love (Love)
With this song
So just hush (Hush)
Baby, shut up (Up)
Heard enough
Stop ta-ta-talking that
Blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be getting this?
Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my
Car-ah-ah
If you keep talking that
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
You be delaying
You're always saying some shit (Sense)
You say I'm playin?
I'm never laying the dick
Sayin' \
