I ain't eez-eh
And i make you mad
At least i ain't sleazy
I'm just tryna put the world to rights

And if you want to
I'll take you out
'Cause i got the feeling that
I'm gonna keep you up all
Gonna keep you up all
Gonna keep you up all night

Tired of taking orders
Coping with disorders
The wrong men have the power
It's turning my milk sour

We're tired of taking orders
Coping with disorders
The wrong men have the power
It's turning my milk sour
Turning my milk sour
Turning my milk sour

I ain't eez-eh
And i make you mad
At least i ain't sleazy
I'm just tryna put the world to rights

And if you want to
I'll take you out
'Cause i got the feeling that
I'm gonna keep you up all night

I ain't eez-eh
But i ain't that mad
No rhyme or reason
I'm just tryna set the world alight

And you got problems
Well so have i
And i got the feeling that
I'm gonna keep you up all
Gonna keep you up all
Gonna keep you up all night

There's cobras in the mosh pit
Finally we lost it
Everyday is brutal
Now we're being watched by Google

Gotta keep it simple
Sending out a signal
Everyone's on bugle
Now we're being watched by Google
Being watched by Google
Being watched by Google

I ain't eez-eh
And i make you mad
At least i ain't sleazy
I'm just tryna put the world to rights

And if you want to
I'll take you out
'Cause i got the feeling that
I'm gonna keep you up all night
I ain't eez-eh
But i ain't that mad
No rhyme or reason
I'm just tryna set the world alight
And you got problems
Well so have i
And i got the feeling that
I'm gonna keep you up all
Gonna keep you up all
Gonna keep you up all night
