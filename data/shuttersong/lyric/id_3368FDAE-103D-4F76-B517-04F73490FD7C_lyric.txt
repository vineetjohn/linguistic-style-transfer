Hey man, heard you were your brother's keeper
That can't be, judging by the way you treat her
Oh no, you've done it again
No use when you already know how it ends

Treat her better, boy
If having her at your side's something you enjoy
If having her in your life's really so important to you now

Hey man, how old is your mother
Oh no, you've done it again
No use when you already know how it ends

If having her at your side's something you enjoy
If having her in your life's really so important to you now
Treat her better, boy

If having her in your life's really so important to you now

Treat her better, boy
If having her at your side's something you enjoy
