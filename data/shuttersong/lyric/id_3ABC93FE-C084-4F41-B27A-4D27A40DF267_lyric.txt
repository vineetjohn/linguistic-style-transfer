And you drop it down low
And you pick pick pick pick pick it up

Twenty more shots then I pass out
But that's what I'm aiming for
Baby, let me drown
When I wake up, I'm still in the club
Looking at the DJ, like turn my shit up, oh
So when the beat beat beat beat beat drops
Get your ass on the floor
