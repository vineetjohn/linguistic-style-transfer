You're no good for me
Baby you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But baby I want you, I want you

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love

Baby put on heart shaped sunglasses
'Cause we gonna take a ride
I'm not gonna listen to what the past says
I've been waiting up all night

Take another drag turn me to ashes
Ready for another lie?
Says he's gonna teach me just what fast is
Say it's gonna be all right

Hit me my darling tonight
I don't know why but I like it
Gotta get back to the wire
Give it up give it up, live it up live it up

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Can we get it downlow, down and gritty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love

Let's take Jesus off the dashboard
Got enough on his mind
We both know just what we're here for
Saved too many times

Maybe I like this rollercoaster
Maybe it keeps me high
Maybe this weed it brings me closer
I could sparkle up your eye

Hit me and tell me you're mine
I don't know why but I like it
Scary, my god, you're divine
Gimme them gimme them dope and diamonds

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Can we get it down low, down and gritty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love

You're no good for me
Baby you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But baby I want you, I want you

You're no good for me
Baby you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But baby I want you, I want you, I want you

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love
