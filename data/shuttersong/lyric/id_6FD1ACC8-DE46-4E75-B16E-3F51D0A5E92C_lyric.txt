Should I write myself
Out of the history books
And mark a place in time
For every chance you took?

Don't get me wrong
I know you've got your life in place
I've yet to take the hint some day
I'm sure I'll get the picture and stop waiting up

When it all comes down
To a sunrise on the East side
Will you be there to carry home?

The remains of my wasted youth
This wasted time on you has left me
Shaking in waiting, shaking in waiting for something more

Tonight is alive with the promise of a street fight
And there's money on the table
Says your cheap shots won't be able to break bones

I've yet to break a sweat
I'll make your past regret it's future
Here's to you

When it all comes down
To a sunrise on the east side
Will you be there to carry home?

The remains of my wasted youth
This wasted time on you has left me
Shaking in waiting for something more

Make all of my decisions for me
I've never taken the fall for deceit
I'll keep a secret if you keep me guessing
The taste of your lips says we shouldn't have met like

Make all of my decisions for me
I've never taken the fall for deceit
I'll keep a secret if you keep me guessing
The taste of your lips says we shouldn't have met like this

I can keep a secret
If you can keep me guessing
The flavor of your lips
Is enough to keep me pressing

For more than just a moment of
Truth between the lies told
To pull ourselves away
From the lives we leave back
I can keep a secret
If you can keep me guessing
The flavor of your lips
Is enough to keep me here, keep me here
When it all comes down
To a sunrise on the East side
Will you be there to carry me home?
The remains of my wasted youth
This wasted time on you has left me
Shaking in waiting for something more
