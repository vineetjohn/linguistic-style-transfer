Travis County - Gary Clark Jr.
Travis County took my picture
But no, I didn't smile
They told me I was gonna be here
For a pretty long while
One day I was walking down the street when
I should've been walking down the hall
Heard a voice calling out, saying
"Ooh, where you going, y'all?"
Now before I could've gathered my thoughts
I turned around and I saw the cops
I pointed arms up right when
He told me I better stop
Oooh, oooh
They put my hands in cuffs
Oh boy, they even locked me up
When I thought that it was all a bluff
Till they started taking my stuff
Now I'm sittin' 'round in my cell
Just a looking at the wall
I didn't even get to make
My one phone call
After I was just sittin' 'round
You know I started getting down
When they let me out
All I could do is scream and shout
