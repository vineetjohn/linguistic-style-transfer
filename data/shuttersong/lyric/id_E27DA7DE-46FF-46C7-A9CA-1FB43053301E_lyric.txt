(Work is never over) cause I can't wait much longer
(Work it harder, make it better) I know I got to be right now
(Do it faster, make us stronger) cause I can't get much wronger

Let's get lost tonight, you could be my black kate moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
You don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome the christian in christian dior
Danm, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask cause I'm not sure, do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in presence of greatness cause right now that has forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I'd even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead, go nuts, go ape shit
Specially on my best stand on my bape shit

Act like you can't tell who made this
New gospel homey take six, and take this haters

Me likey
I don't know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
If God put me in your plans or not

I'm tripping, this drink got me saying a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand \
