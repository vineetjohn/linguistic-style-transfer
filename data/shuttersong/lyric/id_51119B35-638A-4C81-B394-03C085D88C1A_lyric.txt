When the leaves turn around
I watch this burn
a cross the sun and the bod clouds
sun is clear
a ready for a found a lover this is mead for me
when the worst is write
I see myself but you want take this round
I go down
the nets cut
the finger out never for ever in a ghost town

You save me
I save you
The miracle that was meant for two
I save you
You save me
The miracle that even been in my heart

Even been in my heart
Even been in my heart

You save me
I save you
The miracle was meant for two
I save you
You save me
The miracle that even been in my heart
Even been in my heart
