I know that I'm running out of time
I want it all, mmm, mmm
And I'm wishing they'd stop tryna turn me off
I want it all, mmm, mmm
And I'm walking on a wire, trying to go higher
Feels like I'm surrounded by clowns and liars
Even when I give it all away
I want it all, mmm, mmm

We came here to run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

Just like fire, burning up the way
If I could light the world for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic, I'll be flying free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me any way
Just like fire, uh

And people like to laugh at you cause they are all the same, mmm, mmm
See I would rather we just go a different way than play the game mmm,
And no matter the weather, we can do it better
You and me together, forever and ever
We don't have to worry bout' a thing, bout' a thing

We came here to run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

Just like fire, burning up the way
If I could light the world for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic, I'll be flying free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me any way

Just like fire, fire, fire
Run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

So look I came here to run it
Just cause nobody's done it
Y'all don't think I can run it
But look, I've been here, I've done it
Impossible? Please
Watch, I do it with ease
You just gotta believe
Come on, come on with me

Oh, what's you gone do?
(What, what?)
Hey, what's you gone do?
(What, what?)
Oh, what's you gone do?
(What, what?)
Oh, what's you gone do?

Just like fire, burning up the way
If I could light the world for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way

Just like fire, burning up the way
If I could light the world for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic, I'll be flying free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me any way
Just like fire, fire
Run it, run it, run it ji
Just like fire
Run it, run it, run it
