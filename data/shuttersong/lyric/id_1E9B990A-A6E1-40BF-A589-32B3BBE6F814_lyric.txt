Every time that you get undressed...
I hear symphonies in my head
I wrote this song just looking at you oh, oh
Yet the drums they swing low
And the trumpets they go
And the trumpets they go
Yeah the trumpets they go

Da da, da ra ra da, da, da
Da, ra, ra, ra, da, da
Da da, da ra ra da, da, da
Da, ra, ra, ra, da, da
They go

Is it weird that I hear
Violins whenever you're gone?
Whenever you're gone
Is it weird that your ass
Remind me of a Kanye West song?

Is it weird that I hear
Trumpets when you're turning me on?

Is it weird that your bra

Remind me of a Katy Perry song?

Every time that you get undressed
I hear symphonies in my head
I wrote this song just looking at you ooh, oh
Yeah the drums they swing low
And the trumpets they go (and they playing for you girl)
And the trumpets they go (ha, yeah)
Yeah the trumpets they go
Yeah the trumpets they go (go, go go, go go, go, go go)

Is it weird that I hear

Angels every time that you moan?

Is it weird that your eyes
Remind me of a Coldplay song?
