I've done it before, I've seen it before
Tears splashin' the floor when I opened the door for her
She acted like a whore and I'ma let her
Learn from Project Pat uh pimpin' got her masters
Girl, improvise, look me in my eyes and lie to me
Lie to me, act like I'll believe anything
Sex on the beach and in the backseat
This could be us

So back to what I was saying (Money make the world go round)
This could be us but you're playing, (Money make your girl go down)
This could be us but you're playing, (Money make the world go round)
I'm high, I hope I don't sound crazy (Money make your girl go down)
Fuck what them niggas were saying, (Money make the world go round)
This could be us but you playing, (Money make your girl go down)
This could be us but you playing, (Money make the world go round)
But shit, that's all I was saying (Money make your girl go down)
(And that's just how it goes)

New keys to drive this Mercedes
I ball like Tracy McGrady
Before I let a girl touch anything
She gotta say please, say please
And I know they really wish we would ball til we fall
I'm the big bad wolf there's a full moon y'all
Toss the money in the air girl, watch how your dreams hit the floor
Wait til I get the buzz off this drug
Damn girl, you way too fine for a local club
Killin' someone's vibes should be a fuckin' crime
Wasting someone's time should be a fuckin' crime

So back to what I was saying (Money make the world go round)
This could be us but you're playing, (Money make your girl go down)
This could be us but you're playing, (Money make the world go round)
I'm high, I hope I don't sound crazy (Money make your girl go down)
Fuck what them niggas were saying, (Money make the world go round)
This could be us but you playing, (Money make your girl go down)
This could be us but you playing, (Money make the world go round)
But shit, that's all I was saying (Money make your girl go down)
(And that's just how it goes)

Spin the bottle, spin the fuckin' bottle
If you the reason why it's empty, baby, spin the bottle
Truth or dare, no, you don't want no problem
Spin the bottle, spin the fuckin' bottle
If you the reason why its empty baby, spin the fuckin' bottle
Truth or dare, no, no, you don't want no problem
You don't want no problem
Bitch you might as well party

So back to what I was saying (Money make the world go round)
