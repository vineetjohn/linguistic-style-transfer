I've always said I could never fall
Because I love them all
My heart don't race when they try to call
Because I love them all
But she got me stuttering
Like w-w-what can I do because I can't control it
She got me hovering
Above the ground and I don't know what to do
God only knows
How much I need you
I could explode
If I can't breathe you
I'm on the ropes, 5 4 3 2
Cause you're the one
I guess I'm done
That's how it goes
Where will I be without you, yeah
God only knows
There ain't a crime I wouldn't do for you
Let's make our getaway
These diamonds shine but not as bright as you
I'd throw them all away
I'm here surrendering
And I give up, throwing up my hands around ya
I can't remember when
I felt like the way I fell for you (c'mon)
God only knows
How much I need you
I could explode
If I can't breathe you
I'm on the ropes, 5 4 3 2
Cause you're the one
I guess I'm done
That's how it goes
Where will I be without you, yeah
God only knows (God only knows, baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Where will I be without you, yeah
God only knows
When you touch me (damn, girl) with your body,
And all that I can think is how to lose our clothes
What's next?
God only knows
God only knows
God only knows
God only knows
How much I need you
I could explode
If I can't breathe you
I'm on the ropes, like 5 4 3 2
Cause you're the one
I guess I'm done
That's how it goes
Where will I be without you, yeah
God only knows
(God only knows)
Where will I be without you, yeah
God only knows
