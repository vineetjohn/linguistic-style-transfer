That was unforgettable
I wanna do it again
You're crazy like an animal
And I don't want it to end
Tell me all your dreams and darkest fantasies

Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be

Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be

Let's talk about sex

That was unbelievable
I wanna do it again
I'll eat you like a cannibal
You're sweet like cinnamon
Tell me all your dreams and darkest fantasies

Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be

Any way you want it, you can have it
Talk about sex, baby
Do it on the counter, we'll fuck for hours
Let's talk about sex
Any way you want it, you can have it
Talk about sex, baby
Do it in the shower, pussy power
Let's talk about sex, baby
