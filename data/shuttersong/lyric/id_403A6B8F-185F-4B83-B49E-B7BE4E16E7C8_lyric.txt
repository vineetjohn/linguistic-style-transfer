I try so many times
But it's not taking me
And it seems so long ago
That I used to believe
And I'm so lost inside of my head
And crazy
But I can't get out of it
I'm just stumbling

And I'm juggling all the thoughts in my head
I'm juggling and my fears are on fire
But I'm listening as it evolved in my head
I'm balancing on one fine wire

And I remember the time my balance was fine
And I was just walking on one fine wire
And I remember the time my balance was fine
And I was just walking on one fine wire
And It's frayed at both the ends
And I'm slow unraveling

Life plays such silly games inside of me
And I've felt some distant cries following
And they're entwined between the night and sun beams
I wish I were free from this pain in me

And I'm juggling all the thoughts in my head
I'm juggling and my fears are on fire
But I'm listening as it evolved in my head
I'm balancing on one fine wire

And I remember the time my balance was fine
And I was just walking on one fine wire
And I remember the time my balance was fine
And I was just walking on one fine wire
And it's frayed at both the ends
And I'm slow unraveling

And I remember the time my balance was fine
And I was just walking on one fine wire
And I remember the time my balance was fine
And I was just walking on one fine wire

(And I remember the time my balance was fine)
And I'm juggling all the thoughts in my head
(And I was just walking on one fine wire)
I'm juggling and my fears are on fire
(And I remember the time my balance was fine)
But I'm listening as it evolved in my head
(And I was just walking on one fine wire)
I'm balancing on one fine wire...
