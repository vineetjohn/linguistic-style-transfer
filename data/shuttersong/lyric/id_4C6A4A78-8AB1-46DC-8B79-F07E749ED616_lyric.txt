You Need Me, I Don't Need You (Live Ustream Version) - Ed Sheeran

Now I'm in town, Break it down, 
Thinkin' of making a new sound
Playing a different show everynight in front of a new crowd, 
That's you now, Ciao, 
Seems that life is great now, 
See me loose focus, as I sing to you loud.
And I can't. No. I won't hush, 
I say the words that make you blush, 
I gonna sing this now (ow, ow)
See I'm true, my songs are where my heart is, 
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists, 
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous.
So let me sing and do my thing, 
And move to greener pastures, 
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me, 
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy, 
I won't stay put, 
Give me a chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me, 
Cause' you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
Until, You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
Until, you need me.
See, I write my own tune, 
And I write my own verse, 
Don't need another wordsmith, to make my tune sell.
Call yourself a singer-writer, 
You're just bluffing, 
Your names on the credits, 
You didn't write nothing, 
I sing fast, 
I know that all my sh*ts cool, 
I will blast, 
And I didn't go to brit school.
I came fast with the way I act, right.
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe, 
I won't be a product of my genre, 
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are, 
Never believe the bullsh*t that the fake guys feed to ya'
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia, 
And musically I'm demonstrating, 
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at The Enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, 
Until, You need me, man, I don't need you, 
You need me, man, I don't need you, 
You need me, man, I don't need you, 
Until, You need me.
With the lyrics I'll be aiming it right, 
I won't stop till' my names in lights, 
At stadium heights, 
With Damien Rice, on red carpets
Now I'm on Arabian nights, 
Because I'm young, and I know my brothers' gonna give me advice.
Long nighter, short height and I've gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can be the lyrics when I'm singing them out
(Wow)
From day one, I've been prepared
With vo5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
Cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for majors
Nationwide til' we're just jack, soon as I get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the myspace and youtube videos
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me *Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm f*cking in an elevator
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
