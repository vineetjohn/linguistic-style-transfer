Nah nah, honey I'm good,
I could have another but I probably shouldn't,
I've got somebody at home.

It's been a long night here, and a long night there,
And these long, long legs are damn near everywhere,
Hold up now, you look good, I will not lie,
But if you ask where I'm staying tonight I gotta be like.

Oh baby, no baby, you got me all wrong baby,
My baby's already got all my love.

So nah nah, honey I'm good,
I could have another but I probably shouldn't,
I've got somebody at home, and if I stay I might not leave alone,
No, honey I'm good, I could have another but I probably shouldn't,
I've gotta bid you adieu and to another I will stay true.

(Hoo hoo wooh true), I will stay true,
(Hoo hoo wooh true), I will stay true,
(Hoo hoo wooh true),
(Hoo hoo wooh).

Now better men than me have failed,
Drinking from that unholy grail,
Now check it out, I've got her and she got me,
And you've got that ass, but I kindly gotta be like.

Oh baby, no baby, you got me all wrong baby,
My baby's already got all my love.

So nah nah, honey I'm good,
I could have another but I probably shouldn't,
I've got somebody at home, and if I stay I might not leave alone,
No, honey I'm good, I could have another but I probably shouldn't,
I've gotta bid you adieu and to another I will stay true.

(Hoo hoo wooh true), I will stay true,
(Hoo hoo wooh true), I will stay true,
(Hoo hoo wooh true),
(Hoo hoo wooh),

Oh, I'm sure you, sure you will make somebody's night,
But oh, I'll show you, show you it sure as hell's not mine.

Oh no, honey I'm good,
I could have another but I probably shouldn't,
I've got somebody at home, and if I stay I might not leave alone,
No, honey I'm good, I could have another but I probably shouldn't,
I've gotta bid you adieu and to another I will stay.

Nah nah, honey I'm good,
I could have another but I probably shouldn't,
I've got somebody at home, and if I stay I might not leave alone,
No, honey I'm good, I could have another but I probably shouldn't,
I've gotta bid you adieu and to another I will stay true.

(Hoo hoo wooh true), I will stay true,
(Hoo hoo wooh true), I will stay true,
(Hoo hoo wooh true), I will stay true,
(Hoo hoo wooh), I will stay,

Singing out oh oh oh oh oh,(Hoo hoo wooh true),
Singing out oh oh oh oh oh,(Hoo hoo wooh true),
Singing out oh oh oh oh oh,(Hoo hoo wooh true),
Singing out oh oh oh oh oh,(Hoo hoo wooh true),
I will stay true.
