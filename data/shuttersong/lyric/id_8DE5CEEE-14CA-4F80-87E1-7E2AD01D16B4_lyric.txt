I carry the weight of you in my heavy heart
And the wind is so icy, I am numb
I carry the weight of you heading back to start
With the thousand eyes on me, I stumble on
I am tired, I'm growing older
I'm getting weaker every day
I carry the weight of you
I carry the weight of you
Lay down here beside me in the shallow water
Beside me where the sun is shining on us still
Lay down here beside me in the hallowed water
Beside me where the silver lining stays until
the sirens callin'
We follow the sun down low till we hit the night
And you hold me so tightly, it's hard to breathe
And I'm tired, I'm growing older
I'm getting weaker every day
We follow the sun down low
We follow the sun down low
Lay down here beside me in the shallow water
Beside me where the sun is shining on us still
Lay down here beside me in the hallowed water
Beside me where the silver lining stays until
the sirens callin'
the sirens callin'
Yeah, I'm tired, I'm growing older
I'm getting weaker every day
I am drowning, and you're stealing every breath
Take me away and just
Lay down here beside me in the shallow water
Beside me where the sun is shining on us still
Lay down here beside me in the hallowed water
Beside me where the silver lightning stays until
the sirens callin'
the sirens callin'
