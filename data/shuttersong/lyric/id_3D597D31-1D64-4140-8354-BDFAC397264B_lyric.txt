Oh baby, oh baby
(This is a star-studded collaboration)
(I know that you've been hurting)
I'm Nicki Minaj!!!
(Oh baby, oh baby)
That's Bebe, let's go!
(I know that you've been hurting)
No broken hearts in the club
No tears in the club
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
No broken hearts in the club
More drinks, pour it up
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
We goin' straight to Miami
Hop on a plane going no plans
Shinin' so hard like a Grammy

Forget all the players, what they did?
We gon' be buying the drinks

We gon' be buying the drinks

Line up the bottles, line up the models

We gon' forget everything!

Oh, ain't nobody going hoooome!
You, you know what you came for
To dance off the pain, don't feel a thing
You just feel the champagne
If you're feeling lonely

Baby let me hear you say
No broken hearts in the club

No tears in the club
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight

No broken hearts in the club
More drinks, pour it up

'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
We only got one life

So let's go hard 'til the day we die

No broken hearts in the club
More drinks, pour it up

'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight

We gon' do it like Biggie

Sky is the limit in this town

We taking over the city
We so high, can't bring us down
We gon' do what we do
We gon' do what we do

Three in the morning, 4 in the morning
Meet you for eggs in the morning
Oh, ain't nobody going hoooome!
You, you know what you came for
To dance off the pain, don't feel no shame
You just feel the champagne
If you're feeling lonely
Baby let me hear you say
No broken hearts in the club
No tears in the club
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
No broken hearts in the club
More drinks, pour it up
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
We only got one life
So let's go hard 'til the day we die
No broken hearts in the club
More drinks, pour it up
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
Ay yo Bebe, anyone hatin' need a pee pee
Sip a little mix, pop pills till I'm sleepy
I'm the one that bust it open out in Waikiki
Pull up in the Ghost I'm creepy
They don't want beef we proved it
Niggas better keep it on wax like a Q-tip
Keep his dick wetter than the cruise ship
Flower than a tulip, flyer than your new bitch
I do's it, yup I'm up two zip
Girls is my sons I'm giving them mild tease
They be sweating me headbands and gym tees
Like bad knees on Dirk Nowitzki's
It is going down like M. Lewinsky's
Wrist freeze yep my wrist on pink skis
Ring finger be shitting on my pinky's
Make em mad aww man I got them hating bad
Blood clot money green like Jamaican flags
No broken hearts in the club
No tears in the club
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
No broken hearts in the club
More drinks, pour it up
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
We only got one life
So let's go hard 'til the day we die
No broken hearts in the club
More drinks, pour it up
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
