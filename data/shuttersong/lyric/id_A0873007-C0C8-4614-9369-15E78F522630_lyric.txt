I'd rather be a sparrow than a snail
Yes I would
If I could
I surely would

Away, I'd rather sail away
Like a swan that's here and gone
A man gets tied up to the ground
He gives the world
Its saddest sound
Its saddest sound

I'd rather be a hammer than a nail
Yes I would
If I only could
I surely would

Away, I'd rather sail away
Like a swan that's here and gone
A man gets tied up to the ground
He gives the world
Its saddest sound
Its saddest sound

I'd rather be a forest than a street
Yes I would
If I could
I surely would

Away, I'd rather sail away
Like a swan that's here and gone
A man gets tied up to the ground
He gives the world
Its saddest sound
Its saddest sound

I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet
Yes I would
If I only could
I surely would
