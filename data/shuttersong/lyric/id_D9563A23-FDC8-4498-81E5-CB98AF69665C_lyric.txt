When he tried to call his name
The trial would go on
The day is just begun
Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world
The diamond cuts her eye

The crowd behind went wild
They weren't all that proud
By now they hear it loud
Living in an empty world

Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world
I'm ok, I'm alright

I was out late last night
Empty world,
Empty world
I will wait one more night
