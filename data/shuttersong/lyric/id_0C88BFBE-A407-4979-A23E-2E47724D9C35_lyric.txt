Blackout the light
Maybe you’re tired fall
Or stone cold

You fumble and fight
With all the time you spend alone

Cause it’s only fair
It’s love and war
And darkness is all you’ll ever know
If I don’t love you more

A keep in your cage
Withered by aging eyes and skin
You call this your home
A colorful dragging dried up drone

Cause it’s only fair
It’s love and war
And darkness is all you’ll ever know
Oh darkness is all you’ll ever know
Darkness is all you’ll ever know
If I don’t love you more

Loveless sorrow kindly borrowed
The only thing my soul’s now hollow
Loveless sorrow kindly borrowed
The only thing my soul’s now hollow

Cause it’s only fair
It’s love and war (ooh)
And darkness is all you’ll ever know
If I don’t love you more
