
Down on Bowery they lose their
Ball-eyes and their lip-mouths in the night,
And stumbling through the streets they say,
"Sir, do you got a light?
And if you do then you're my friend,
And if you don't then you're my foe,
And if you are a deity of any sort
Then please don't go."

Ne Me Quitte Pas, Mon Cher
Ne Me Quitte Pas
Ne Me Quitte Pas, Mon Cher
Ne Me Quitte Pas

And down on Lexington they're wearing
New shoes stuck to aging feet,
And close their eyes and open,
And I recognize the aging street,
And think about how things were right
When they were young and veins were tight
And if you are the ghost of Christmas Past
Then won't you stay the night?

Ne Me Quitte Pas, Mon Cher
Ne Me Quitte Pas
Ne Me Quitte Pas, Mon Cher
Ne Me Quitte Pas
Ne Me Quitte Pas, Mon Cher
Ne Me Quitte Pas
Ne Me Quitte Pas, Mon Cher
Ne Me Quitte Pas

Down in Bronxy-Bronx the kids go
Sledding down snow-covered slopes
And frozen noses, frozen toes
And frozen city starts to glow
And yes, they know that it'll melt
And yes, they know New York will thaw
But if you are a friend of any sort
Then play along and catch a cold!

Ne Me Quitte Pas, Mon Cher
Ne Me Quitte Pas
Ne Me Quitte Pas, Mon Cher
Ne Me Quitte Pas
Ne Me Quitte Pas, Mon Cher
Ne Me Quitte Pas
Ne Me Quitte Pas, Mon Cher
Ne Me Quitte Pas

I love Paris in the rain.
I love Paris in the rain.
I love, I love, in the rain...
