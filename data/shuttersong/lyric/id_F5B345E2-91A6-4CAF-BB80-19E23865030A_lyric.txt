When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen
'Cause she stays strong

Yeah, yeah

She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone

And they say
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
I'm like no, not really, 'cause

Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

She walks like a model
She grants my wishes like a genie in a bottle
Yeah, yeah

'Cause I'm the wizard of love
And I got the magic wand
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone

And they say
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
I'm like no, not really, 'cause

Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

She gives me love and affection
Baby, did I mention you're the only girl for me?
No, I don't need a next one

Mama loves you too
She thinks I made the right selection
Now all that's left to do is just for me to pop the question

Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
