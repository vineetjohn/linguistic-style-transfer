You know I can be found
Sitting home all alone
If you can't come around
At least please telephone.
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.

Baby, if I made you mad
For something I might have said
Please, lets forget the past
The future looks bright ahead
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
I don't want no other love
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of

Don't stop thinking of me
Don't make me feel this way
Come on over here and love me
You know what I want you to say.
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
Why should we be apart?
I really love you baby, cross my heart.

Lets walk up to the preacher
And let us say I do
Then you'll know you'll have me
And I'll know that I'll have you
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
I don't want no other love
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of.

Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
I don't want no other love
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of
