You can run you can hide
But you can't escape my love, love, love, love
You can run you can hide
But you can't escape my love

Here's how it goes
You and me
Up and down but maybe this time
We'll get it right
Worth the fight
'Cause love is something you can't shake
When it breaks
All it takes is some tryin'

If you feel like leaving I'm not gonna beg you to stay
But soon you'll be finding
You can run you can hide
But you can't escape my love
You can run you can hide
But you can't escape my love
So if you go

You should know
It's hard to just forget the past
So fast
It was good
It was bad but it was real and that's
All you have
In the end our love mattered
(No, no, no)
If you feel like leaving

I'm not gonna beg you to stay
(I won't beg you to stay)
But soon you'll be finding
You can run you can hide
But you can't escape my love
You can run you can hide
But you can't escape my love
You can run, you can hide

But you can't escape my love
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love
Here's how it goes

All it takes is some tryin'
(Baby you can run)
If you feel like leaving

I'm not gonna beg you to stay
(I won't beg you to stay)
But soon you'll be finding
(You'll be finding)
You can run you can hide
But you can't escape my love
(You can't escape my love)
If you feel like leaving

I'm not gonna beg you to stay
(You can't escape my love)
But soon you'll be finding
You can run you can hide
But you can't escape my love
(No, no)
You can run...

you can run...
You can run...
you can run...
(You can run)
Baby, you can run, baby you can hide
(You can run)
But you can't escape my love
(You can run)
Baby you can run, baby you can hide
(You can run)
But you can't escape my love
You can run, you can run
(You can run you can hide)
But you can't escape my love, love, love, love
You can run you can hide
But you can't escape my love
