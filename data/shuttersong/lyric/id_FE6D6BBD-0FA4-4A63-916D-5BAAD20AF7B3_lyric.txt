
I met this girl down the block from me
Used to tell myself she was too hot for me
But then I saw her at the corner store
So I ran on over just to grab the door
I got her number we started chillin (hey)
We started buzzin, we got addicted
Now I, I'm the one she can't live without
I bet that's her right now


Shorty hittin' me up
Says she wanna re-up
Knows I got the best in town
Cuz when she get the shivers
She knows that I'll deliver
I'm the one that holds her down
She's about to break break break break break 
And I won't let her wait wait wait wait wait
It's gettin' kinda late late late late late
And she just wanna shake shake shake shake shake


One day she started texting me
Asked if she could borrow that recipe
I told her loving you is my specialty
She said well give it up up, give it up up
When she's away it's such a downer

And I miss her every time I'm not around her
Cuz she, she's the one I can't live without
I hope that's her right now


I'm hooked on her
I must admit it
I'd do anything to get it
She hooked on it
A bad habit
She'd do anything to have it
When she calls I know
Exactly what she wants from me
Yea anytime I hear my phone ringin'
She wants to shake it with me
