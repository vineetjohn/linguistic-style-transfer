Hands On Me - Ariana Grande
Keep your hands on me
Don't take them off until I say so
Let me break you off
We'll be taking off
Or maybe making love
You just keep your eyes
On my you know what
Trembling  when you touch
Rush is racing body baking
Picture me and you making
Making sweet love
Baby give it to me
Eyes on me  dance on me tonight
Your all  all on me
Keep your hands on me
Don't take them off
Put your hands on it
Put your hands on it
