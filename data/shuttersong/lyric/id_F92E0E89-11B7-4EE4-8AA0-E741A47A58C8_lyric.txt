Some people want me to be heads or tails,
I say no way, try again another day,
I should be happy, not tipping the scales,
I just won't lay, letting my life get away.

I'm no fool, no, I'm not a follower,
I don't take things as they come, if they bring me down,
Life can be cruel, if you're a dreamer,
I just wanna have some fun, don't tell me what can't be done.

You know you like it but it drives you insane,
You know you like it but it drives you insane,
You know you like it but you're scared of the shame,
What you want, what you gonna do?
You know you like it but it drives you insane,
Only 'cause you know that you wanna feel the same,
You know you like it but it drives you insane,
What you want, what you gonna do?

If you wanna train me, like an animal,
Better keep your eye on my every move,
There's no need to be so damn cruel,
Baby you got nothing to prove.
