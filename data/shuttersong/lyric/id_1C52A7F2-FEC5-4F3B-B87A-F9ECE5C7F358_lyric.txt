All that is, was and will be
Universe much too big to see

Time and space never ending
Disturbing thoughts, questions pending
Limitations of human understanding
Too quick to criticize
Obligation to survive
We hunger to be alive

All that is, ever
Ever was
Will be ever
Twisting
Turning

Through the never
In the dark, see past our eyes
Pursuit of truth no matter where it lies
Gazing up to the breeze of the heavens

On a quest, meaning, reason
Came to be, how it begun

All alone in the family of the sun
Curiosity teasing everyone
On our home, third stone from the sun
All that is, ever
Ever was
Will be ever

Twisting
Turning
Through the never
On through the never
We must go
On through the never
Out of the
Edge of forever
We must go
On through the never

Then ever comes
All that is, ever
Ever was
Will be ever
Twisting
Turning
Who we are
Ask forever
Twisting
Turning
Through the never
Never
