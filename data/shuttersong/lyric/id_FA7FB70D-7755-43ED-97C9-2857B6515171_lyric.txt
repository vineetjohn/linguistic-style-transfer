Fixing up a car to drive in it again
searching for the water hoping for the rain
Up and Up, Up and Up

Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and Up, Up and Up

See a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, it's in your blood

Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and Up, Up and Up it's saying

We're going to get it get it together right now
Going to get it get it together somehow
Going to get it get it together and flower
oh oh oh oh oh oh

We're going to get it get it together I know
Going to get it get it together and flow
Going to get it get it together and go
Up and Up, Up and Up

Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and Up, Up and Up

How come people suffer how come people part?
How come people struggle how come people break your heart?

Break your heart
Yes I want to grow yes I want to feel
Yes I want to know show me how to heal it up
heal it up

See the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love just need love
When the going is rough saying

We're going to get it get it together right now
Going to get it get it together somehow
Going to get it get it together and flower
oh oh oh oh oh oh

We're going to get it get it together I know
Going to get it get it together and flow
Going to get it get it together and go
Up and Up, Up and Up

And you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind or take a risk
You can say it's mine and clench your fist
Or see each sunrise as a gift

We're going to get it get it together right now
Going to get it get it together somehow
Going to get it get it together and flower
oh oh oh oh oh oh

We're going to get it get it together I know
Going to get it get it together and flow
Going to get it get it together and go
Up and Up, Up and Up

We're going to get it get it together right now
Going to get it get it together somehow
Going to get it get it together and flower
oh oh oh oh oh oh

We're going to get it get it together I know
Going to get it get it together and flow
Going to get it get it together and go

Up and Up, Up and Up

oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh oh oh oh

Fixing up a car to drive in it again
When you're in pain
When you think you've had enough
Don't ever give up
Don't ever give up
