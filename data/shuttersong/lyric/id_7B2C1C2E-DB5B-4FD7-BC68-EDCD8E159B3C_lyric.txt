Come all ye weary and ye broken
Come to the table of the Lord
Come sing the song of the forgiven
Come lay your burden on the word

Come and find peace
Everyone needs a little rest
Everyone needs a little joy
And a song to sing in the darkest night
And life even when it gets you down
Hope will turn it all around
But love is the greatest of these
Everyone needs a little

Sing all ye saints and ye sinners
Call upon the mercy of the Lord
Come sing the song of redemption
Sing about the hope that is to come

Come and find peace
Everyone needs a little rest
Everyone needs a little joy
And a song to sing in the darkest night
And life even when it gets you down
Hope will turn it all around
But love is the greatest of these
Everyone needs a little

He will lift you up
He will lift you up higher than sorrow
He will lift you up
Cover your soul with healing

Come and find peace
Everyone needs a little rest
Everyone needs a little joy
And a song to sing in the darkest night
And life even when it gets you down
Hope will turn it all around
But love is the greatest of these
Everyone needs a little

Peace
Everyone needs a little rest
Everyone needs a little joy
And a song to sing in the darkest night
And life even when it gets you down
Hope will turn it all around
But love is the greatest of these
Everyone needs a little
Everyone needs a little
Everyone needs a little
