I don't know where I, Am going to rest my head tonight. So I won't promise that I'll speak to you today.
But if I ever find

Another place
A better time
For that moment I was never what I am
Take to me to where you are

What you've become
And what you will do when I am gone
I won't forget
I won't forget
Maybe someday

You'll be somewhere
Talking to me
As if you knew me
Saying I'll be home for next year, darling
I'll be home for next year
In between the lines

Is the only place you'll find
What you're missing but you didn't know was there
So when I say goodbye
You must do your best to try
And forgive me this weakness
This weakness
'Cause I don't know what to say

Another day
Another excuse to be sent your way
Another day
Another year
Maybe someday

You'll be somewhere
Talking to me
As if you knew me
Saying I'll be home for next year, darling
I'll be home for next year
And maybe sometime
In a long time
You'll remember
What I had said there
I said I'll be home for next year, darling
I'll be home for next year
If

You
Think of me

I will think of you
Maybe someday
You'll be somewhere
Talking to me
As if you knew me
Saying I'll be home for next year, darling
I'll be home for next year
Maybe sometime
In a long time
You'll remember
What I had said there
I said
I'll be home for next year
Maybe someday
You'll be somewhere
Talking to me
As if you knew me
Saying I'll be home for next year, darling
I'll be home for next year
