I feel so close to you right now
It's a force feel
I wear my heart upon my sleeve, like a big deal
Your love bows down, I mean surround me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now

(Dance beat plays)

I feel so close to you right now
It's a force feel
I wear my heart upon my sleeve, like a big deal
Your love bows down, I mean surround me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now

I feel so close to you right now

(Dance beat plays)

And there's no stopping us right now
And there's no stopping us right now
And there's no stopping us right now

I feel so close to you right now...
