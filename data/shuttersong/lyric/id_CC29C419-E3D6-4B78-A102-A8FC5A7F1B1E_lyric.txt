Do I imagine it, or do I see your stare?
Is there still longing there?
Oh I hate myself, and I feel crazy
Such a classic tale

Current girlfriend, ex-girlfriend, I¡¯m trying to be cool
Am I being paranoid? Am I seeing things? Am I just insecure?

I want to believe
It¡¯s just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there¡¯s three of us in here, baby

So I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking ¡¯bout her or about me?
And while I wait I put on my perfume,
Yeah, I want it all over you
I'm gonna mark my territory

I¡¯ll never tell, tell on myself but I hope she smells my perfume
I¡¯ll never tell, tell on myself but I hope she smells my perfume
I hide it well, hope you can¡¯t tell but I hope she smells my perfume
I hide it well, hope you can¡¯t tell but I hope she smells my perfume

I wanna fill the room when she¡¯s in it with you
Please don¡¯t forget me
Do I imagine it, or catch these moments?
I know you got history

But I¡¯m your girlfriend, now I¡¯m your girlfriend trying to be cool
I hope I¡¯m paranoid, that I¡¯m just seeing things, that I¡¯m just insecure

I want to believe
It¡¯s just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there¡¯s three of us in here, baby

So I, wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking ¡¯bout her or about me?
And while I wait I put on my perfume,
Yeah, I want it all over you
I'm gonna mark my territory
