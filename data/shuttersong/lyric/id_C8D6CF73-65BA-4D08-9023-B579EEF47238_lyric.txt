"Santa Claus Lane"

I remember last Christmas Eve
Something happened that I couldn't believe
I went for a walk as the snow came down
And when it stopped I was in a different town
And the sign said have no fear; your not lost your here!

Walking this christmas
Down santa claus lane
No need to wonder
No need to explain
Just have some faith in what you see
Your right here where you wanna be
Walking this christmas
Down santa claus lane
Down Santa Claus Lane

Elves were standing in the street
Snow men and reindeer came out to greet
Silver bells chimed from far away
As santa rode by on an open sleigh
And he told me have no fear
Your not lost, your here!

Walking this christmas
Down santa claus lane
No need to wonder
No need to explain
Just have some faith in what you see
Your right here where you wanna be
Walking this christmas
Down santa claus lane
Down Santa Claus Lane

I don't know How
I dont know when
but one day
I'll be back again

And he told me have no fear
Your not lost your here

Walking this christmas
Down santa claus lane
No need to wonder
No need to explain
Just have some faith in what you see
Your right here where you wanna be
Walking this christmas
Down santa claus lane

Down Santa Claus Lane

Down Santa Claus Lane

Down Santa Claus Lane

Down Santa Claus Lane
