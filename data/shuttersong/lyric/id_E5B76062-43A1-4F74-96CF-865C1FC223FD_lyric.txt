Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning, she don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die, these words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I been holding on too tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love, until she's broke inside
The story of my life

Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning I'll see us in the light upon your ear
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I been holding on so tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love, until she's broke inside
The story of my life

And I've been waiting for this time to come around
But baby, running after you is like chasing the clouds

The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen

The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love, until she's broke inside
The story of my life

The story of my life
The story of my life
The story of my life
