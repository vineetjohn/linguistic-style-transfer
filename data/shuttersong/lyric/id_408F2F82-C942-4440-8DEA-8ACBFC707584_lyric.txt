I want your hot hands on me
It's getting cold, baby
I want your hot hands on me

HOT HANDS, I need your hot hands on me
HOT HANDS, I need your hot hands on me

Our love is sweet, it might be pure
But there are some days I can't endure
Too lonely, cold, honestly
Give me those hot hands that I crave
