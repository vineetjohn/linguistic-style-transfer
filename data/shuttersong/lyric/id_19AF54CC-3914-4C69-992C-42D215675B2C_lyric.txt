I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard
With an open heart
I'm wide awake
How did I read the stars so wrong?
I'm wide awake

And now it's clear to me
That everything you see
Ain't always what it seems
I'm wide awake
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long

I wish I knew then
What I know now
Wouldn't dive in
Wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts
You made it so sweet
Till I woke up on
On the concrete

Falling from cloud 9
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah, I'm falling from cloud 9

I'm wide awake
Not losing any sleep
I picked up every piece
And landed on my feet
I'm wide awake
Need nothing to complete myself, no
I'm wide awake
Yeah, I am born again
Out of the lion's den
I don't have to pretend
And it's too late
The story's over now, the end

I wish I knew then
What I know now
Wouldn't dive in
Wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts
You made it so sweet
Till I woke up on
On the concrete

Falling from cloud 9
(It was out of the blue, I'm)
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
(Yeah, I'm ready to go, I'm)
I'm falling from cloud 9
I'm wide awake
Thunder rumbling
Castles crumbling
(I'm wide awake)
I am trying to hold on
I'm wide awake
God knows that I tried
Seeing the bright side
(I'm wide awake)

I'm not blind anymore
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
Yeah, I'm falling from cloud 9
(It was out of the blue, I'm)
Crashing from the high
You know I'm letting go tonight
(Yeah, I'm ready to go, I'm)
I'm falling from cloud 9
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
