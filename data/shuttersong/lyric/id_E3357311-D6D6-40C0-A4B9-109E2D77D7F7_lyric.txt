We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh
(So is you 'bout it 'bout it?)
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh
(So is you 'bout it 'bout it?)
Uh, then go crowd around it
And tell everyone that live in your whole town about it
Gon' and roll up that good weed, I put about a pound in
And get high as the mountains
I remember the days when niggas used to have some love for a g
But now they doubt it
Would've been down with me and my team, but now they outted
Put my all in my everything and what I got is
So much money I can't even motherfuckin' count it
Uh, and you can have all of this

After all the hard work you can have all of this
Money and the cars, clothes, you can have all of this
Roll up in the best clubs, you can have all the women

Homie when the checks come, you can have all of this

When you put your family on, you can have all of this
When you let the stress go, you can have all of this

You lookin' at the best, so that's why I got all of this
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh

We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh
(So is you 'bout it 'bout it?)
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh
(So is you 'bout it 'bout it?)
Uh, uh-huh, no pain
Oh, uh-huh, no gain
Who said we can't change the world?
Look how we changed the game

Uh, uh-huh, no pain
Oh, uh-huh, no gain
Who said we can't change the world?

Look how we changed the game
Look how far up we came, shit
Look how my chain done changed
Man look at they faces

Now when they look in our faces
Look when they look in our faces
They look at us and we're famous
And I don't know where my plane is

I haven't been home in ages
Got people blowin' my phone up
So many important waivers
My marijuana's the loudest
That mean my weed is the greatest
I give a fuck about a hater
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh
(So is you 'bout it 'bout it?)
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh

(So is you 'bout it 'bout it?)
Uh, how far you gotta go 'til you feel like you're already home?
And how much you gotta spend
Til you realize that you really never goin' broke
How many motherfuckers gotta tell you that you changed
Cause you got a little change

And how the fuck they gon' tell you you the best
When they told somebody else the same thing
(Come on) Cause you fly first class every day?
(Come on) Cause you roll up all that grass every day?
(Come on) Cause you spend up all that cash every day?
(Come on) Drivin' them foreign cars fast every day?
(Come on) And if you ain't, this the kind of shit you need to get on
I'm talkin'?, leather seats I sit on
This ain't just how I feel today, this the shit I been on, I been on
People always talkin' about what they think they know
About what they think I'm doin', how I feel, and where I go
But no matter how much money I make, I'm gon' stay the same
Since I've been up at the top ain't too much changed
Cause we already on
We already on
We already on
And on and on, and on and on
Never smoked weed that was quite this strong
Never took a flight this long
Never drank champaign in Italy
Never spent a night in Rome
But it's funny cause those are the exact same things
That helped me write this song
Caught up livin' a life where tryin' to do all the right things feels wrong
So I keep rollin' and lightin' up and prayin' to God that we live long
It's summertime, lights fade away
It's wintertime, let's make it summer
Don't look down, keep your head up
Don't look down, keep your head up
It's summertime, lights fade away
It's wintertime, let's make it summer
Don't look down, keep your head up
Don't look down, keep your head up
People always talkin' about what they think they know
About what they think I'm doin', how I feel, and where I go
But no matter how much money I make, I'm gon' stay the same
Since I've been up at the top ain't too much changed
Cause we already on
We already on
We already on
