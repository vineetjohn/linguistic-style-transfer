 the power of love, that’s  the power of love
First time you feed, it might make you sad
Next time you feed, it might make you mad
But you’ll be glad, baby when you've found
That’s  the  power, makes  the world go round
And it don’t need money, don’t take fame
Don’t need no credit card to ride this train
It’s strong and it’s sudden and it’s cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
They say that all in  love  is fair
Yeah but you don’t care
But you know what to do
When it gets hold  of you
And with  a little help from above
You feel  the  power  of  love
You feel  the  power  of  love, can you feel it?
It don’t take money, don’t take fame
Don’t need no credit card to ride this train
Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel
You won’t feel it when until you feel
You feel  the  power, just feel  the  power  of  love
That’s  the  power and that’s  the  power  of  love
You feel  the  power  of  love, you feel  the  power  of  love
You feel  the  power  of  love
