I wanna go
So what'd you say
When you gonna let me know
If you give a damn about me

'Cause you got my hands tied
In my defense
I always fall for confidence
And your compliments look good on me

Cause nobody knows it better
Than the girl in the corner with the scarlet letter
And while you're watching you may think that she doesn't matter
But no one knows you better

Oh yeah

I wanna dance
I wanna dance
I wanna dance with you
So take a chance
Take a chance

Oh yeah

I need a sign or a signal
I've overthought everything I can think of
Into symbol
I need the coat and your jacket
And the remnants of your cigarette packet

I wanna go
So what'd you say
When you gonna let me know
If you give a damn about me

'Cause you got my hands tied
In my defense
I always fall for confidence
And your compliments look good on me

Cause nobody knows it better
Than the girl in the corner with the scarlet letter
And while you're watching you may think that she doesn't matter
But no one knows you better

I wanna dance
I wanna dance
I wanna dance with you
So take a chance
Take a chance

Oh yeah
