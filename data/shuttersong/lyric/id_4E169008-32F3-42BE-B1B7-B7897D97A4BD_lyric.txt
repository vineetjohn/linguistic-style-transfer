There is only one Flo and one Rida (one love one love)

Enrique
She came nowhere and she stole my soul,
Her love was criminal
I finally found what I was looking for,
Now I can't let it go...
We break up to make up
You got me spinning like a yo yo yo

But I know that you know
That girl you will always be mine
Hey!
There goes my baby whoa

Hey hey baby come back to me
There goes my baby whoa
Hey hey baby come back to me

I get so high when she go down down low
She work it nice and slow
We going round and round and back and forth
Can't take it anymore

We break up to make up
You got me spinning like a yo yo yo
But I know that you know
That girl you will always be mine

Hey!
There goes my baby whoa
Hey hey baby come back to me

There goes my baby whoa
Hey hey baby come back to me
There goes my baby
My wholesome lady
Hold me down if my whole world went crazy
That' s what she spoke
Just what she said
Now that's a joke
That talk is dead
Know I got to get over the love I had
The door I keep it open just in case she come back
Can't deal with the emotions to the point I'm sad
And I know my hearts broken but I've got so attached
Baby come back I won't get no sleep
She more than I want and all that I need
Locked up my heart and threw away the key so
And when my baby come back I'm crossing my T's dotting my I's
And now I can't eat

Out of my mind
And that's how it's gonna be so, so, so
There goes my baby
Whoa
Hey hey baby come back to me
Hey!
There goes my baby whoa
Hey hey baby come back to me
Hey!
There goes my baby whoa
Hey hey baby come back to me
Hey!
There goes my baby whoa
Hey hey baby come back to me
