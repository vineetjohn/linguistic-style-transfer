Baby last night was hands down
One of the best nights
That I've had no doubt
Between the bottle of wine
And the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain.

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in my life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night.
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man.
Happy man baby. hmm

Baby your red dress brings me to my knees
Oh but that black dress makes it hard to breathe.
Your saint, your a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you
In my wildest dreams.

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man, yeah.

I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby you're my great escape.
We could stay at home, listen to the radio

Or dance around the fireplace.
Oh if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man.
Baby I could die a happy man.
Oh I could die a happy man.
You I could girl.
I could die I could die a happy man.
ohh.
