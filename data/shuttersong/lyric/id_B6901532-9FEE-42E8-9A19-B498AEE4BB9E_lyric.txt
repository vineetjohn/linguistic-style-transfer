I could write a song with my new
piano
I could sing about how love is a
losing battle
Not hard, (it's not hard)
It's not hard, (it's not hard)
It's not hard, (it's not hard)
It's not hard, (It's not hard)

And I could sing about cupid and his
shooting arrow
In the end, you'll find out that my
heart was battered
Real hard (Real hard)
It's so hard (So hard)
Real hard (Real hard)
It's that hard (It's that hard)

But I rather make a song they can
play on the radio
That makes you wanna dance
Don't it make you wanna dance
But I rather make a song they can
play on the radio

That makes you wanna grab your
lover's hand
So hold up and
Take it through the night
And you should follow through
To make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get
'em up
I want to see you rock to the piano
the piano

I'd rather tell you about how I'm
feeling boy
And how I'm doing things my way
If I got my piano, then I know I'd be
okay
