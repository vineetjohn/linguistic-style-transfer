Don't Cry - Guns N' Roses
Talk to me softly
There's something in your eyes
Don't hang your head in sorrow
And please don't cry
I know how you feel inside I've
I've been there before
Something is changing inside you
And don't you know 
Don't you cry tonight  I still love you  baby
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight  there's a heaven above you  baby
And don't you cry tonight
Give me a whisper
And give me a sign
Give me a kiss before you
Tell me goodbye
Don't you take it so hard now
And please don't take it so bad
I'll still be thinkin' of you
And the times we had  baby
And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight  there's a heaven above you  baby
And don't you cry tonight
And please remember
That I never lied
And please remember
How I felt inside now  honey
You gotta make it your own way
But you'll be alright now  sugar
You'll feel better tomorrow
Come the morning light now  baby
And don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight  there's a heaven above you  baby
And don't you cry  don't you ever cry  don't you cry tonight
Baby  maybe someday
Don't you cry  don't you ever cry
Don't you cry tonight
