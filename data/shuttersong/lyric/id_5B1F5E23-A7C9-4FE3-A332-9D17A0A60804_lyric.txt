So this is Xmas
And what have you done
Another year over
And a new one just begun

And so this is Xmas
I hope you have fun
The near and the dear ones
The old and the young

A very Merry Xmas
And a Happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

And so this is Xmas
For weak and for strong
The rich and the poor ones
The world is so wrong

And so Happy Xmas
For black and for white
For yellow and red ones
Let's stop all the fight

A very Merry Xmas
And a Happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

And so this is Xmas
And what have we done
Another year over
A new one just begun

And so Happy Xmas
We hope you have fun
The near and the dear ones
The old and the young

A very Merry Xmas
And a Happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

War is over
If you want it
War is over now
