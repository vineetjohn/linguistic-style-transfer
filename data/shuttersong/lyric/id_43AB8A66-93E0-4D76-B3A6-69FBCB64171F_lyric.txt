I've known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at night
Disappearing all night
I don't wanna know where he's been lying

I know what I wanna do
I wanna runaway
Runaway with you
Gonna grab clothes, socks, in the morning, go

How long you leaving?
Well dad just don't expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day
Thumb on side of the roadway, but

I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own

I've never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone, in the kitchen light
I tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
And this is what I'm gonna do
Gonna runaway, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes, and when it's morning, go

How long you leaving?
Well dad just don't expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day
Thumb on side of the roadway, but

I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own

Back pack, and a flat cap, turned to the back
Cause I packed my closet
My dad was a man without plans
But taking turns to show love
I don't wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
Could be persuaded to hold up

And mama was the same
None of us are saints
I guess that god knows that
I don't wanna runaway
And one of these days I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both showlaces, and hope that
Things change, but for now I leave town with a backpack on my shoulder
I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own
