Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
(Music)
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming
Confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling
I can't seem
To find myself again
My walls are closing in

(Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)

I've felt this way before
So insecure!!
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting
Reacting
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting
How I can't seem
To find myself again
My walls are closing in

(Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)

I've felt this way before
So insecure!!
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

(There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface)

(Consuming)

Confusing what is real

(This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling)

Confusing what is real!
