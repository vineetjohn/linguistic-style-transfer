Screen falling off the door door hanging off the hinges
My feet are still sore my back is on the fringes
We tore up the walls we slept on couches
We lifted this house we lifted this house

Fire-crackers in the east my car parked south
Your hands on my cheeks your shoulder in my mouth
I was up against the wall on the west mezzanine
We rattle this town we rattle this scene

O, Anna Sun!
O, Anna Sun!

What do you know? this house is falling apart
What can I say? this house is falling apart
We got no money, but we got heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
This house is falling apart

This house is falling apart

Live my life without
Station wagon rides
Fumbling around the back
No Ones seat belt on
Wait for summertime
Coming up for air
Now it's all a wash
Now it's all a wash

Live my life without
Coming up for air
Now it's all a wash
I want everyone
Racing down the hill
I am faster than you
Wait for summertime
Wait for summertime

O, Anna Sun!
O, Anna Sun!

Sun!
