I close my eyes, I take it slow
Lay on down and let me rest my soul
I've been so high, I've been so low
I'm just try a find my way back home
Can't help but roam
My signal's gone
Guess this journey's left me on my own
I don't care why I'm alone, alone, alone

And if I could
Forget about the way you love me
Forget about the world, we're set in stone
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
I never thought that I'd be broken
I never thought I'd be this far from home
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now

If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground

I close my eyes, I take it slow
Lay on down and let me rest my soul
I've been so high, I've been so low

I'm just tryna find my way back home
Can't help but roam

My signal's gone
Guess this journey's left me on my own
I don't care why I'm alone, alone, alone

And if I could
Forget about the way you love me
Forget about the world, we're set in stone
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
I never thought that I'd be broken
I never thought I'd be this far from home
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now

If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground

Take it one day at a time
Reach for the stars now
Ooh just leave the past behind
It's a part of living
It's a part of living

If only I could hit the ground
If only I could
If only I could hit the ground
I could hit the ground, right now
If only I could hit the ground
If I could hit the ground
Then I'd be falling down
If only I could hit the ground
If I could hit the ground
Then I'd be touching down
If only I could hit the ground
