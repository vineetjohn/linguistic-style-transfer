Here I am again, the same old situation
Why does the guy thing have to be so complicated?
I should've played it cool, instead I've made a fool
Oh, the things I do

'Cause I'm young and I'm done
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, you can't blame a girl for trying

(oh oh oh oh)

No, you can't blame a girl for trying
I should've shut my mouth, I could've kept it quiet
I might have freaked him out 'cause I was so excited
But I just couldn't wait, I took a leap of faith

Oh, the things I say
'Cause I'm young and I'm done
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying

Well, you can't blame a girl for trying

(oh oh oh oh)
No, you can't blame a girl for trying
And I think sometimes I tend to be my own worst enemy

And maybe someday I'm gonna catch a shooting star falling out of the blue
Doing what I do
And just as I'm giving up, my heart is palpitating
Here comes another one, I'm so intoxicating
Being where I've been I know that in the end
I'll do it all again
'Cause I'm young and I'm dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, love will find me, there ain't no denying
That you can't blame a girl for trying
No, you can't blame a girl for trying
