What's been happening in your world?
What have you been up to?
I heard that you fell in love, or near enough
I gotta tell you the truth (yeah)

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late but baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing
Or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here
Waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it.

Forever isn't for everyone
Is forever for you?
It sounds like settling down
Or giving up
But it don't sound much like you girl

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late but baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing
Or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here
Waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it.

Under a spell you're hypnotized (ooh)
Darling how could you be so blind (snap out of it)
