If I should stay
I would only be in your way

So I'll go, but I know

I'll think of you every step of the way
And I will always love you
I will always love you

You, my darling you

Bittersweet memories
That is all I'm taking with me

So, goodbye please, don't cry

We both know I'm not what you, you need
And I will always love you
I will always love you
I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
And I wish to you, joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love
And I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I, I will always love you
You, darling, I love you
Ooh, I'll always, I'll always love you
