Does it make you feel good to make me feel small?
When you're pushing me down, does it make you feel tall?
Pointing out my flaws cause you wanna erase them all
Does it make you feel good to make me feel small?

Betcha didn't think I knew what I was made of
Thought I would lay down
I wouldn't stand up
Well listen up cause you got it all wrong
This is your song, this is your song

I'm not a paper doll
Can't make me what you want
You just build me up and tear me down
Enough's enough
Go, leave me alone
Cut me down but I won't fall
I'm not a paper doll

Did somebody make you feel invisible?
Is it true hurt people hurt people?
The way you hate and break
It don't make no sense at all
But you're not gonna make me feel invisible

Betcha didn't think I knew what I was made of
Thought I would lay down
I wouldn't stand up
Well listen up cause you got it all wrong
This is your song, this is your song

I'm not a paper doll
Can't make me what you want
You just build me up and tear me down
Enough's enough
Go, leave me alone
Cut me down but I won't fall
I'm not a paper doll
I'm not a paper doll
Can't make me what you want
You just build me up and tear me down
Enough's enough
Go, leave me alone
Cut me down but I won't fall

Oh, you'd love if you crumble me up
In the palm of your hands
Well, I bet that sucks
Cause now you know you can't

Does it make you feel good to make me feel small?
When you're pushing me down, does it make you feel tall?
