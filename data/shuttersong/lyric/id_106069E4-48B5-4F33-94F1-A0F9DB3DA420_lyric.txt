Somebody's somebody
Somewhere, someone
It's 2 o'clock in the morning and I just can't sleep
Outside the rain is pourin', I'm lonely as can be
Maybe 2night'll be different than the nights before
I need 2 feel someone beside me, I can't be alone no more

2night I wanna be somebody's somebody
2night I wanna belong 2 someone (Someone)
2night I wanna be somebody's somebody
2night I want somebody that'll do it 'til the job gets done (Oh yeah)
This big ol' world can be so empty livin' in it all alone

I realize, in its best disguise, a pretty house don't make a home
There's a hunger deep inside of me, how the fire burns
I wanna give good love 2 someone and get good love in return, oh
2night I wanna be somebody's somebody Somebody's somebody

2night I wanna belong 2 someone (Someone)

Someone 2 hold me in that hour midnight
Someone 2 console me when things ain't goin' 2 right
Someone 2 bring me dinner sometime, yeah (Mine, all mine)

Somebody I can call all mine
It's 2: 05 in the morning and I got no one 2 call
I'm longin' 2 hear another voice inside these lonely walls (Lonely walls)
Maybe 2night'll be different (different) than the nights before (Maybe not)

I need 2 feel someone beside me, I cannot be alone no more (No more, no more!)
