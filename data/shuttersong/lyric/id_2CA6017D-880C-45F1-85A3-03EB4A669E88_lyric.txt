How long will I love you?
As long as stars are above you
And longer, if I can.
How long will I need you?
As long as the seasons need to
Follow their plan.
How long will I be with you?
As long as the sea is bound to
Wash up on the sand.
How long will I want you?
As long as you want me to
And longer by far.

How long will I hold you?
As long as your father told you
As long as you can.
How long will I give to you?
As long as I live through you
However long you say.

How long will I love you?

As long as stars are above you
And longer if I may.
Mmmmm mmmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmmm mmmm
