 You may find yourself in a beautiful house with  a beautiful wife
 You  may ask  yourself, well, how did I get here?
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again after the money's gone
Once  in  a lifetime, water flowing underground
 You  may ask  yourself, how do I work this?
 You  may ask  yourself, where is that large automobile
 You  may tell  yourself, this is not my  beautiful  house
 You  may tell  yourself, this is not my  beautiful wife
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the money's gone
Once  in  a lifetime, water flowing underground
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Water dissolving and water removing
There is water at the bottom of the ocean
Remove the water, carry the water
Remove the water from the bottom of the ocean
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the money's gone
Once  in  a lifetime, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, into silent water
Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground
Letting the days go by, into silent water
Once  in  a lifetime, water flowing underground
 You  may ask  yourself, what is that  beautiful  house
 You  may ask  yourself, where does that highway lead to
 You  may ask  yourself, am I right, am I wrong
 You  may say to  yourself, my god, what have I done?
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the money's gone
Once  in  a lifetime, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, into silent water
Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground
Letting the days go by, into silent water
Once  in  a lifetime, water flowing underground
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Time isn't holding us, time isn't after us
Time isn't holding us, time doesn't hold  you back
Time isn't holding us, time isn't after us
Time isn't holding us
Letting the days go by, letting the days go by, letting the days go by, once  in  a lifetime 
Letting the days go by, letting the days go by, letting the days go by, once  in  a lifetimeSend
