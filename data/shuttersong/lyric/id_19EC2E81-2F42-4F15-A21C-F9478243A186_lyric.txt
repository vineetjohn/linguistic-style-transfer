Could have come through anytime
Cold lonely, puritan
What are you fighting for?
It's not my security

It's just an old war
Not even a cold war
Don't say it in Russian
Don't say it in German
Say it in broken English
Say it in broken English

Lose your father, your husband
Your mother, your children
What are you dying for?
It's not my reality

It's just an old war
Not even a cold war
Don't say it in Russian
Don't say it in German
Say it in broken English
Say it in broken English

What are you fighting for?
What are you fighting for?
What are you fighting for?
What are you fighting for?

What are you fighting for?
What are you fighting for?

Could have come through anytime
Cold lonely, puritan
What are you fighting for?
It's not my security

It's just an old war
Not even a cold war
Don't say it in Russian
Don't say it in German
Say it in broken English
Say it in broken English

Say it in broken English
Say it in broken English

What are you fighting for?
What are you fighting for?
What are you fighting for?
What are you fighting ...
