Did you have to leave so soon?
Didn't wanna make you run around
Cause it seems i tripped up once again
Now I'm lying down again
Staring up in to a cloud of questions, why
Blurry visions of tight eyes
Got a lot of things that I need to say
Got a lot of things that I need to
Find a way to rest my head
Just try to clean my eyes
Why did you walk away
Why did you walk away
Cause I'm thinking its you
Ive been thinking 'bout you everyday
I see you, I can run my way
So easy get to your embrace
Its like you never went away
Glow, like you can't escape the rays
You baby left to save the day
Love hoping we can make it fade
Come on through to your embrace
