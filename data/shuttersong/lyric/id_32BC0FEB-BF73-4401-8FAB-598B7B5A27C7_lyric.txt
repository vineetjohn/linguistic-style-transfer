SAIL!
This is how I show my love.
I made it in my mind because
I blame it on my ADD baby.
This is how an angel dies
Blame it on my own sick pride
Blame it on my ADD baby

Maybe I should cry for help
Maybe I should kill myself (myself)
Blame it on my ADD baby
Maybe I'm a different breed
Maybe I'm not listening
So blame it on my ADD baby
