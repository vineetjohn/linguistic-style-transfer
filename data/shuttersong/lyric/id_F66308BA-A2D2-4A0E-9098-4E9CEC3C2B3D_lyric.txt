Shawty hit me on the late night

Got a man, got me thinking, shawty, ain¡¯t right

Oh, I¡¯ll lay you down and go down

Girl, till I reach your ocean

Oh ooh, so come and get this dick

When you get that itch, adrenaline

Heart beating outta your chest

Heart beating outta yo chest

And when that pressure¡¯s building
