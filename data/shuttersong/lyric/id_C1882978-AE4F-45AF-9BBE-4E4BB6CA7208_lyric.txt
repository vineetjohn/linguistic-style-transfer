Wherever You Are - 5 Seconds Of Summer
For a while we pretended
That we never had to end it
But we knew we'd have to say goodbye
You were crying at the airport
When they finally closed the plane door
I could barely hold it all inside
Torn in two
And I know I shouldn't tell you
But I just can't stop thinking of you
Wherever you are
You
Wherever you are
Everynight I almost call you
Just to say it always will be you
Wherever You are
I could fly a thousand oceans
But there's nothing that compares to
What we had and so I walk alone
I wish I didn't have to be gone
Maybe you've already moved on
But the truth is I don't want to know
Torn in two
And I know I shouldn't tell you
But I just can't stop thinking of you
Wherever you are
You
Wherever you are
Everynight I almost call you
Just to say it always will be you
Wherever you are
You can say we'll be together
Someday
Nothing lasts forever
Nothing stays the same
So why can't I stop feeling this way
Torn in two
And I know I shouldn't tell you
But I just can't stop thinking of you
Wherever you are
You
Wherever you are
Every night I almost call you
Just to say it always will be you
Wherever you are
