I keep on fallin' in
And out with you
Sometimes I love you
Sometimes you make me blue
Sometimes I feel good
At times I feel used
Lovin' you darlin'
Makes me so confused
I keep on fallin' in and out

Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I loved you
Oh, oh, oh

Never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure
And cause me so much pain
Just when I think
I've taken more than would a fool
I start fallin' back in love with you

I keep on fallin' in and out
Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I loved you
Oh baby
I, I, I, I'm fallin'
I, I, I, I'm fallin'
Fall, fall, fall...
Fall, fall...
I keep on fallin' in and out
Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I loved you

I'm fallin' in and out
Of love with you
I never loved someone

The way that I loved you
I'm fallin' in and out
Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I loved you
