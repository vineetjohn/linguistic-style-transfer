I've been looking under rocks and breaking locks
Just tryna find ya
I've been like a maniac insomniac
5 steps behind you
Tell them other girls, they can hit the exit
Check please...
Cause I finally found the girl of... my dreams
Much more than a Grammy award
That's how much you mean to me

I could be you it girl
Baby you're the shit oh
Lovin' you could be a crime
Crazy how we fit oh
This is it boy
Give me 25 to life
I just wanna rock all night long
And put you in the middle of my spotlight
I could be you it girl

be you're biggest hit girl

Let me play it loud
Let me play it loud like... oh oh oh oh
Let me play it loud

Let me play it loud like... oh oh oh oh
Let me play it loud

You can't help but turn them heads
Knockin' them dead
Dropping like flies around you
If I get your body close not letting go
Hoping you're about to
Tell them other guys they can lose your number
You're done!
They don't get another shot cause you're... love drunk

Like a TV show playing reruns
Every chance I get
I'mma turn you on

You could be my it girl
Baby you're the shit girl
Lovin' you could be a crime
Crazy how we fit girl
This is it girl
Give me 25 to life

I just wanna rock all night long
And put you in the middle of my spotlight
You could be my it girl
You're my biggest hit girl

Let me play it loud
Let me play it loud like... oh oh oh oh
Let me play it loud
Let me play it loud like... oh oh oh oh
Let me play it loud

Can't seem to stop you from... running, running
Through my, through my mind, mind
Just keep it coming, coming
Til I make you mine, mine

You've got that something, something
I wanna be with girl
You're my greatest hit girl
Just say this is it girl...
Hey baby...
Don't you know you're my it girl

You could be my it girl
Baby you're the shit girl
Lovin' you could be a crime
Crazy how we fit girl
This is it girl
Give me 25 to life

And put you in the middle of my spotlight
You could be my it girl
You're my biggest hit girl
Let me play it loud
Let me play it loud like... oh oh oh oh
Let me play it loud
Let me play it loud like... oh oh oh oh
