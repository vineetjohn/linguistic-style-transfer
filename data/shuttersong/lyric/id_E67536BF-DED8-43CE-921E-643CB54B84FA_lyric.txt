Hey, hey
Oh, no, no, no

Her light is as loud as as many ambulances
As it takes to save a savior
Whoa whoa whoa

She floats through the room on a big balloon
Some say she's such a fake, that her love is made up
No, no, no, no

Let's have another toast to the girl almighty
Let's pray we stay young, stay made out of lightning

Am I the only, only believer?
There's something happening here
There's something happening here

The only, only believer
There's something happening here
I hope you feel what I'm feeling too

I get down, I get down, I get down
On my knees for you
I get down, I get down, I get down
On my knees
I get down on my knees for you
