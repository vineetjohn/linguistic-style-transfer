She's American - The 1975
A big town
Synthetic apparitions of not being lonely
Look he's having a breakdown
Oh what a let down a shame
I think he might die
She's dancing enthralling
I guess
I gotta wait my turn
I said don't fall in love with the moment
She said
I've got a lot to learn
You know
I'm in love with this city
But the green is turning brown
And
I just look pathetic now
If she likes it cause we just don't eat
And we're so intelligent she's american
If she says
I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American she's American
And she likes it cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant she's American
If she says
I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American she's American
She's inducing sleep to avoid pain
And I think she's got a gun divinely decreed
And custom made
She calls on the phone like the old days
Expecting the world
Don't fall in love with the moment
And think you're in love with the girl
There's no more water in this city
But be careful or you'll drown
You think you've got it figured out
If she likes it cause we just don't eat
And we're so intelligent she's American
If she says
I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American she's American
And she likes it cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant she's American
If she says
I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American she's American
Well your face has got a hold on me
But your brain is proper weird
Are you feeling the same
You just keep nodding at me looking vacant
If she likes it cause we just don't eat
And we're so intelligent she's American
If she says
I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American she's American
If she likes it cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant she's American
If she says
I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American she's American
