It's 11: 11 make a wish and make a wish and say [x2]
It's 11: 11 make a wish make a wish and say
I hope you come true
Yeah, 1 2 3 4 soon as you walk through the door
Counting 5 6 7 8 9 one million thoughts quick hit my mind
(Have you been running)
Where have you been lately
Ohh, you know it drives me crazy
You know I miss your kiss
Hate to let you see me like this
Because I know when she's on my mind
She's got me all worked up inside
And I know it's going down tonight
Because she's moving and it's feelin right
Girl you got me feelin right
And I know that you've been hatin me
Let the things I say be history
You can move like that, I can move like this
Girl you know it's time to make a wish
Make a wish girl

Cause 4 3 2 1 I don't wanna be singing alone
You are the perfect melody but now my harmonys feelin outta key
And I just wanna feel your love again (I wanna feel love)
Why don't you say that we're more than friends
Because I know that when she's on my mind
She's got me all worked up inside
And I know it's going down tonight
Because she's moving and it's feelin right
Girl you got me feeling right
And I know that you've been hating me
Let the things I say be history
You can move like that, I can move like this
Girl you know it's time to make a wish
