Brush off my shoulders, but not 'cause it's colder
Will it get better, now that we're older?
Remember the feeling, a deeper emotion
To be high as a mountain, as deep as the ocean

How I wish I could turn back time
Oh, I just hate being without you

It's just another thing to break through
Carry the hurt I dare not speak it
Bring back the love that we all believe in
How I wish I could turn back time
