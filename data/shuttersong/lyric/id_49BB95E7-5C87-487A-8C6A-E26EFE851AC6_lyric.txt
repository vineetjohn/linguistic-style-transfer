Think of me when you're out, when you're out there
I'll beg you nice from my knees...

And when the world treats you way too fairly

Well, it's a shame I'm a dream...

All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you...
I think I'll pace my apartment a few times
And fall asleep on the couch
And wake up early to black and white reruns
That escaped from my mouth, oh, oh
All I wanted was you...
All I wanted was you...
All I wanted was you...
All I wanted was you...
I could follow you to the beginning
Just to relive the start
And maybe then we'll remember to slow down
And all of our favorite parts
All I wanted was you...
All I wanted was you...
All I wanted was you...
All I wanted was you...
All I wanted was you...
