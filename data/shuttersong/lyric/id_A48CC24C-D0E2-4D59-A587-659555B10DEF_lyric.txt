Let's talk about what's on your mind
Leave out your famous dream, oh
You say your man don't take the time
Don't see no fancy ring, ah yeah

Falling in love on the first date
I don't even know your last name
You're living off daddy's money, but honey
Even though these are our best days
We only do things in the worst way
Let your hair down and dance with me

[Chorus:]
Give into your dark side, your dark side
I've seen the way you look at me; it feels right, ah
There's no need convincing me of things you should
Oh, I know you got a dark side
Oh, won't you give it to me?

My lips are numb; can't walk the line
Why don't you try it too?
I like the red, hope you don't mind
And it tastes so good on you, ooh, yeah

Falling in love on the first date
I don't even know your last name
You're living off daddy's money, but honey
Even though these are our best days
We only do things in the worst way
Let your hair down, won't you, babe?

[Chorus:]
Give into your dark side, your dark side
I've seen the way you look at me; it feels right, ah
There's no need convincing me of things you should
Oh, I know you got a dark side
Oh, won't you give it to me?

This life that you've known was in control
Now that the lights start to go, it fills your soul
Just close your eyes; let the night take you whole
Take you whole, let it go, let it go, oh

[Chorus:]
Give into your dark side, your dark side
I've seen the way you look at me; it feels right, ah
There's no need convincing me of things you should
Oh, I know you got a dark side
Oh, won't you, babe?
Give into your dark side, your dark side
I've seen the way you look at me; it feels right, ah
There's no need convincing me of things you should
Oh, I know you got a dark side
Oh, won't you give it to me?
