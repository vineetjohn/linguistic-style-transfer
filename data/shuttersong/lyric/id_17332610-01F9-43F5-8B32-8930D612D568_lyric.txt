Crazy - Kat Dahlia
Is it crazy that I want you to stay
When I tell you to leave
When I tell you go
Is it crazy that I say your name
All times of day then I say my own
Tell me baby is it crazy
Tell me baby is it crazy
Is it crazy when you're gone for a minute
I'm missing you yea I feel alone
Is it crazy that I'm jealous of them bitches
When they get yo time and I know it's wrong
Tell me is it crazy
Yea  I need to know if it's crazy  damn
Cause I ain't been myself
Lately something's going on
No  boy I ain't even slept
I¡¯ve been up all night long
In my head
Tryna figure out what I want 
What I do  what I don't
Is it crazy all that I miss is is you
Tell me cause it's blowing my mind
Tell me cause I don't understand
How someone just can't walk into your life
And everything before that you forget
Is it crazy
Tell me what's going on  I need to know
Cause I ain't tryna lose myself or lose control
Baby tell me the truth  I need to know
Is it crazy
Baby  is it crazy
Is it crazy that I told my ex don't call no more
Cause I'm in love
Is it crazy that I keep your shirt right here
Just to smell your cologne
Damn it sounds crazy
Tell me is it crazy
Cause I ain't been myself
Lately something's going on
No  boy I ain't even slept
I¡¯ve been up all night long
In my head
Tryna figure out what I want 
What I do  what I don't
Is it crazy all that I miss is is you
Tell me cause it's blowing my mind
Tell me cause I don't understand
How someone just can't walk into your life
And everything before that you forget
Is it crazy Is it crazy
Crazy Is it crazy
Crazy Is it crazy
Tell me Is it crazy
Is it crazy Is it crazy
Well if it is I'll just be crazy for you
Baby cause it's blowing my mind
Tell me cause I don't understand
How someone just can't walk into your life
And everything before that you forget
I'm crazy crazy crazy for you
I'm crazy crazy crazy for you
