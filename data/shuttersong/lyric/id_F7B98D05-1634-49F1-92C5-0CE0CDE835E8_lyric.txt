[(Ooh)(Ooh)(Ooh)(Ooh)]

Even when my luck is down
I take joy in knowing that our love grows
But if my vices are a burden
Please don't let me off
Cast me from your home

[(Ooh)(Ooh)(Ooh)(Ooh)]

'Cause lately I've wronged you
And not been on your side, love
Maybe I've been gone
Please don't ask me why

I turn away just when you want me
And I know that home is where you want me
There's not much for me there

Never gave a thought to an honorable living
Always had sense enough to lie
It's getting hard to keep pretending
I'm worth your time
