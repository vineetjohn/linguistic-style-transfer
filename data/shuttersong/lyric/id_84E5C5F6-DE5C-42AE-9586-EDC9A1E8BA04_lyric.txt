Look back
To when midnights broke their sleep
Awake in our memories
Of when we would make believe

Collide
Colors of the masquerade
Watch as they fall away
Faceless under faces made

And weeks went by but felt like hours
Spring would lie in summer showers
In my hair were winter flowers

And weeks went by but felt like hours
Seasons multiplying powers
That I found in winter flowers

Turn back
I see rivers beyond the line
Ancient roads in broken design
Angels running thru our minds

Look up
Your city's built on marble floors
Neon lights in the falling snow
Those night back in tokyo

And weeks went by but felt like hours
Spring would lie in summer showers
In my hair were winter flowers

And weeks went by but felt like hours
Seasons multiplying powers
That I found in winter flowers

And we said
This has only just begun
In the end
Time forever favors the young

And we said
This has only just begun
In the end
Time forever favors the young
