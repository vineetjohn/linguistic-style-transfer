If I say I'm difficult sometimes
Say whatever comes to my mind
Would you stay with me any anyway

If you knew I made a lot of noise
Say whatever just to make my point
Would you stay with me any anyway

Well this is the only tori that I know how to be
Sorry if that don't fit your reality
...
I'm giving one hundred percent of me
So take it or leave
Whether you're in or out

This is what I'm about
Because I'm up
I'm down
I'm left
I'm right
Imma be myself all day and night
Whether you leave or stay
This is me any anyway
I'll do my own thing and that's alright
It's the way I choose to live my life
Whether you leave or stay
This is me any anyway
Woah oh oh oh
...

Oh oh oh oh
This is me any anyway
If I said I'm gonna make you wait

I don't mean it but I'm always late
Would you stay with me any anyway
If I see you getting out of line

best believe I'm gonna handle mine
Would you stay with me any anyway
Well this is the only tori that I know how to be
...
Sorry if that don't fit your reality
I'm giving one hundred percent of me

So take it or leave
Whether your in or out
This is what I'm about
Because I'm up
I'm down
I'm left
I'm right
Imma be myself all day and night
Whether you leave or stay
This is me any anyway
I'll do my own thing and that's alright
It's the way I choose to live my life
Whether you leave or stay
This is me any anyway
Woah oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

This is me any anyway
Woah oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Where do I begin
I'm too full in my skin
I don't smoke, I drink
You act like its a sin
But while you're out partyin' with men and women who be pretendin'
I'm cool with being different while you hipsters blend in
My head's full of dreams
And I feel like I'm livin' them
while you're messin' with perfection
Inspirations what I'm chasin'

And take it or leave it babe
I'm not gonna change
If you don't understand I don't need you anyway
I'm the only tori that I know how to be
Sorry if that don't fit your reality
I'm giving one hundred percent of me

So take it or leave
...
Whether you're in or out
This is what I'm about
Because I'm up
I'm down
I'm left
I'm right
Imma be myself all day and night
Whether you leave or stay
This is me any anyway
I'll do my own thing and that's alright
It's the way I choose to live my life
Whether you leave or stay
This is me any anyway
Woah oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
This is me any anyway
Woah oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
This is me any anyway
...
Woah oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
