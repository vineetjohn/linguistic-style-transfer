Don't talk to strangers.

Oh, in the strangest dreams, walking by your side
It is the hole you impose upon your life
When you're out, loneliness, it crawls up in the ground
It's what you feel, but can't articulate out loud.

Oh you go to sleep on your own and you wake each day with your thoughts
And it scares you being alone
It's a last resort

All you want is someone onto whom you can cling
Your mother warned of strangers and the dangers they may bring
Your dreams and memories are blurring into one
The scenes which hold the waking world slowly come undone

You'll come undone

Oh, you go to sleep on your own,
And you wake each day with your thoughts
And it scares you being alone,
It's a last resort

You go to sleep on your own
And you wake each day with your thoughts
And it scares you being alone, it's a last resort

OhOhOh...

Don't talk to strangers,
And don't walk into danger.
Don't talk to strangers,
And don't walk into danger.

Oh you go to sleep on your own,
And you wake each day with your thoughts
And it scares you being alone,
It's a last resort

You go to sleep on your own,
And you wake each day with your thoughts
And it scares you being alone,
It's a last resort

Don't talk to strangers

Oh you go to sleep on your own,
And you wake each day with your thoughts
And it scares you being alone,
It's a last resort...
