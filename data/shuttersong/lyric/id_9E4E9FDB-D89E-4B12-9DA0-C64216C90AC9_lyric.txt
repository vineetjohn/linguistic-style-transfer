I wanna tell you you're beautiful
In a way that you have not heard before
But I don't think it's gonna work
Cause I'm not good with words
I wanna tell you you're the reason why
The earth spins and the stars hang in the sky
But I don't think it's gonna fly
Cause I'm not good with words
If only I could find a way
To say it like them poets say
Sing a sweet and simple serenade
Directly to your heart
If only I could speak aloud
Just what I feel when you're around
I finally confess my love in verse

But I'm not good with words

If I was just like Shakespeare
Whispering sweet sonnets in your ear
I'd tell you everything you wanna hear
But I'm not good with words
If only I could find a way
To say it like them poets say
Sing a sweet and simple serenade
Directly to your heart
If only I could speak aloud
Just what I feel when you're around
I finally confessed my love in verse

But I'm not good with words
Sentences or conversations
Ohh words
They only bring me complication
And when it comes to love
I'm useless

Just full of bad excuses
And confessions gone unheard

If only I could find a way
To say it like them poets say
Sing a sweet and simple serenade
Directly to your heart
If only I could speak aloud
Just what I feel when you're around
I'd finally confess my love in verse
But I'm not good with words ...
