I close my eyes to see
My king in majesty
Your grace compels my soul
To love and drawing close

I lift my hands and sing
Surrender everything
In you I know I'm found
My God, to you I'll bow

Now until forever
Jesus, I surrender
Show me what I don't know
More of you
I'm desperate for your presence
Longing to be with you
Lead me to a new place
More of you

Through the fire I'll persevere
I won't submit to any fear
Where I'll go, you've been before
All my trust is in you, lord

Now until forever
Jesus, I surrender
Show me what I don't know
More of you
I'm desperate for your presence
Longing to be with you
Lead me to a new place
More of you

Lead me to you
Forever, lord, I will pursue
I will pursue
You've won my heart
Jesus, you're all that I want
All that I want

Now until forever
Jesus, I surrender
Show me what I don't know
More of you
I'm desperate for your presence
Longing to be with you
Lead me to a new place
More of you

Now until forever
Jesus, I surrender
Show me what I don't know
More of you
I'm desperate for your presence
Longing to be with you
Lead me to a new place
More of you
Open my eyes
Let me see more of your love
More of your love
Here I will wait
Just for a glimpse of you, God
I'll wait for you, God
