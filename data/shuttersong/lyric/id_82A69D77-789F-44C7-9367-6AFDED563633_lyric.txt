I, I need you
I, I don't
I question myself all the time, asking what
I don't know
It's kinda hard to walk right
When you're walking on my left
With your high heels on
And your sexy ass dress
I see you talking on your phone, phone
Wish I could get you on your own, own
But I've seen you gone over love

I think I know she don't love me
That's why I fuck around
I think I know she don't love me
That's why I fuck around

I want you
Your body
I want you
Your body on top of mine

I, I want you
I, I don't
I question myself all the time, asking why
I don't know
It's kinda hard to walk right
When you're walking on my left
With your high heels on
And your sexy ass dress
I see you talking on your phone, phone
Wish I could get you on your own, own
But I've seen you gone over love

I think I know she don't love me
That's why I fuck around
I think I know she don't love me
That's why I fuck around

I want you
Your body
I want you
Your body on top of mine

Should we wait 'til the morning?
See it loud in your eyes
Can't escape what I'm feeling
Your body on top of mine

I think I know she don't love me
That's why I fuck around
I think I know she don't love me
That's why I fuck around

I want you
Your body on top of mine
I want you
Your body on top of mine
