Four letter word
But I don't have the guts to say it
Smile 'til it hurts
Let's not make it complicated
We've got a story
But I'm about to change the ending
You're perfect for me
You're more than just a friend
So we can just stop pretending now
Gotta let you know somehow

I'll be your shelter
I'll be your storm
I'll make you shiver
I'll keep you warm
Whatever weather
Baby I'm yours
Be your forever, be your fling
Baby I will be your everything
Baby I

Baby I will

Baby I will be your everything
We used to say
That we would always stick together
But who's to say
That we could never last forever

Girl, got a question
Could you see yourself with somebody else?

'Cause I'm on a mission
And I don't wanna share
I want you all to myself right now

And I just wanna scream it out
I'll be your shelter
I'll be your storm
I'll make you shiver
I'll keep you warm
Whatever weather

Baby I'm yours
Be your forever, be your fling
Baby I will be your everything

Baby I

Baby I will
Baby I will be your everything
No matter what you do

I'll be there for you
And every time you close your eyes

I will be by your side
'Cause every time you make me sing
Baby I will be your everything
I'll be your shelter

I'll be your storm
I'll make you shiver
I'll keep you warm
Whatever weather
Baby I'm yours
Be your forever, be your fling
Baby I will be your everything
Baby I
Baby I will
Baby I will be your everything
Baby I
Baby I will
Baby I will be your everything
Baby I
Baby I will
Baby I will be your everything
