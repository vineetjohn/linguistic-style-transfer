I need your love, need your love

Taste in your tongue, the smoke in your lungs
And I need your love, and I need your love
Salt on your skin is pulling me in
And I need your love, and I need your love

I don't wanna say goodbye to another night
And watch you walk away
I don't wanna let it burn in the city lights
And make the same mistakes

This time
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it
Don't wanna waste the night
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it

I don't wanna waste it
Don't wanna waste the night

The scratch in your voice
leaves me no choice
And I won't give up, and I can't give up
I don't wanna say goodbye to another night

And watch you walk away
I don't wanna let it burn in the city lights
And make the same mistakes
This time
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it

Don't wanna waste the night
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it

I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it
Don't wanna waste the night
I don't wanna say goodbye to another night

I don't wanna let it burn in the city lights
I don't wanna say goodbye to another night
And watch you walk away
I don't wanna let it burn in the city lights
And make the same mistakes
This time
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it
Don't wanna waste the night
I don't wanna waste the night
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it
Don't wanna waste the night
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
