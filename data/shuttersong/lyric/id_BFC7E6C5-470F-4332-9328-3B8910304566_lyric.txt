Cool - Alesso/Roy English
Written by£ºDaniel Davidsen
I saw stars on the pavement
California dreams
Looked up through the bright lights
No stars did I see
You said it's all yours if you take it there
I said I can't do it alone I swear
You said it's all yours
It's all yours and you smiled
It's only you who
Loves me like you do do
Tryna keep it cool cool
But I can't keep cool about it
Acting like a fool fool
Wanna scream it from the roof roof
I'm tryna keep it cool cool
But I can't keep cool about it
And for your love I was blind
Drifting at sea
You were the beacon I followed home
You were the one who rescued me
You said it's all yours if you take it there
I said I can't do it alone I swear
You said it's all yours
It's all yours and you smiled
It's only you who
Loves me like you do do
Tryna keep it cool cool
But I can't keep cool about it
Acting like a fool fool
Wanna scream it from the roof roof
I'm tryna keep it cool cool
But I can't keep cool about it
You said
Oooh wooah
I don't wanna lose your love
Oh woaah
It's only you who
Loves me like you do do
Tryna keep it cool cool
But I can't keep cool about it
Acting like a fool fool
Wanna scream it from the roof roof
I'm tryna keep it cool cool
But I can't keep cool about it
