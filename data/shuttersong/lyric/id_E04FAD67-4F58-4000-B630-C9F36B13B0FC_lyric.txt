She eyes me like a pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black

Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey!
Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
...your advice
Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
Cut myself on Angel Hair and baby's breath

Broken hymen of your highness I'm left black

Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back
