It feels like we been living in fast-foward
Another moment passing by
The party's ending but it's now or never
Nobody's going home tonight

Katy Perry's on replay
She's on replay
DJ got the floor to shake
The floor to shake

People going all the way
Yeah, all the way
I'm still wide awake
I wanna stay up all night

And jump around until we see the sun
I wanna stay up all night
And find a girl and tell her she's the one

Hold on to the feeling
And don't let it go
Cause we got the flow now
Get out of control

I wanna stay up all night
And do it all with you
Up all night
Like this, all night, hey

Up all night
Like this, all night, hey
Up all night
Don't even care about the table breaking

We only wanna have a laugh
I'm only thinking 'bout this girl I'm seeing
I hope she wanna kiss me back
