When tomorrow comes
I'll be on my own
Feeling frightened up
The things that I don't know
When tomorrow comes
Tomorrow comes
Tomorrow comes
And though the road is long
I look up to the sky
And in the dark I found I stop and I won't fly
And I sing along I sing along then I sing along
I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me and see sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me gettin' me through the night
Can't stop my heart when you shinin' in my eyes
Can't lie it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me gettin' me through the night
Cause you're my flash light
You're my flash light you're my flash light
I see the shadows long beneath the mountain top
I'm not afraid when the rain won't stop
Cause you light the way
You light the way you light the way
I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me and see sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me gettin' me through the night
Can't stop my heart when you shinin' in my eyes
Can't lie it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me gettin' me through the night
Light light you're my flash light
Light light you're my flash light
Light light you're my flash light
You're my flash
Oh
I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me and see sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me gettin' me through the night
Can't stop my heart when you shinin' in my eyes
Can't lie it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're my flash light
Gettin' me through the night
Cause you're my flash light
Cause you're my flash light
You're my flash light
You're my flash light light light
You're my flash light light light yeah yeah
You're my flash light
