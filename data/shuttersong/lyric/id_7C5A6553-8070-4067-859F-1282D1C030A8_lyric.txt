Elvis is my daddy
Marilyn's my mother
Jesus is my bestest friend
We don't need nobody
'Cause we got each other
Or at least I pretend

We get down every Friday night
Dancing and grinding in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry
We're feeling alright
Mary prays the Rosary for my broken mind
(I said, "Don't worry about it")

I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric

Sing that body electric
Sing that body electric
I'm on fire
Baby I'm on fire

Whitman is my daddy
Monaco's my mother
Diamonds are my bestest friend
Heaven is my baby
Suicide's her father
Opulence is the end
¡°
I sing the body electric, baby
¡ª Lana Del Rey


We get down every Friday night
Dancing and grinding in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry
We're feeling alright
Mary prays the Rosary for my broken mind
(I said, "Don't worry about it")

I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric

Sing that body electric
Sing that body electric
I'm on fire
Sing that body eletric

My clothes still smell like you
And all the photographs say that you're still young
I pretend I'm not hurt and go about the world, like I'm having fun

We get crazy every Friday night
Drop it like it's hot in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry, feeling alright
Mary swaying softly to her hearts delight
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric
Sing that body electric
Sing that body electric
I'm on fire, baby, I'm on fire
