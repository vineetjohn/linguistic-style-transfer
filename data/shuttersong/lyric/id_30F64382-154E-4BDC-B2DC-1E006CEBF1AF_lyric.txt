Switch it up, switch it up
Yeah
Eh eh eh
Yeah
Let's go

I called my girl
'Cause I got a problem
Only a curl is gonna solve it
Then I don't really care
Just get him out my hair, yeah
Let's switch it up
Get it off my shoulder
I've had enough
Can't take no longer
I'm over him, I swear
I'm like yeah

Gotta get him out my hair
Gotta get him out my hair
Gotta get him out my hair
Gotta get him out my hair

'Cause he was just a dick and I knew it
Got me going mad sitting in this chair
Like I don't care
Gotta get him out my hair
I tried everything but it's useless
He pushed me so far, now I'm on the edge
Make him disappear
Gotta get him out my hair

Gonna bleach him out, peroxide on him
Hair on the floor, like my memory of him
Now I feel brand new
This chick is over you
We're going out
Ain't got no worries
Drama now, now it just seems so funny
Put my hands up in the air
I'm like yeah

Gotta get him out my hair
Gotta get him out my hair
Gotta get him out my hair
Gotta get him out my hair

'Cause he was just a dick and I knew it
Got me going mad sitting in this chair
Like I don't care
Gotta get him out my hair
I tried everything but it's useless
He pushed me so far, now I'm on the edge
Make him disappear
Gotta get him out my hair

Da-da-da-da-da da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da da-da-da-da-da-da, eh oh

Friend you need to get your phone
Erase that number, don't call him back
'Cause he don't deserve it
And when you see him in the club
Just flip your hair, don't show him in any love
'Cause you've had enough
Woah oh oh

'Cause he was just a dick and I knew it
Got me going mad sitting in this chair
Like I don't care
Gotta get him out my hair
I tried everything but it's useless
He pushed me so far, now I'm on the edge
Make him disappear
Gotta get him out my hair

Go get him out my hair
He's in my hair
Gonna get him out
Gonna get him out
Gotta get him out my hair
