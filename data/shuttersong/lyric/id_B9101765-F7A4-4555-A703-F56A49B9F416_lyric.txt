We're the kids,
we're the kids,
we're the kids of the future.Standing on a dirty old rooftop
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by.
I sit here alone and I wonder why.

Come on Louis, keep moving foward
Hold your head up high there's no time for looking down
You will not believe where we're going now.

Here we go let me remind you,
Look ahead the past is behind you.

We're the kids of the future. WOAH!
We're the kids of the future. WOAH!
Everybody live ‘cuz the future is now.

Bright lights,
Boy, look around you.
Your imagination is working overtime.
The world that you've dreamt of has now arrived.
Hot shots the great adventure,
Is where the family you've searched for comes alive.
So come meet the Robinsons.

Looking for a place you belong to,
Looking for a family that wants you.

We're the kids of the future. WOAH!
We're the kids of the future. WOAH!
Everybody live ‘cuz the future is now.

Everyday we have fun me and Wilbur.
So happy to be here with the Robinsons
I finally feel I can be someone.
Outside the new day is dawning,
Outside the daylight is sprawling everywhere.
I know that it's right because,

We'll save the future together,
This family's forever!

We're the kids of the future. WOAH!
we're the kids of the future. WOAH!
Everybody live ‘cuz the future is now.
