You may think I'm strong and I can do no wrong
but I'm vulnerable
so vulnerable without you
I may be hard to take
but you can't call me fake
'cause I'm vulnerable
so vulnerable
without you

I know the assumption is that I'm tough
and with all my anger that's fair enough
Even with friends I have to compete
and try being me when you walk down the street
It's not easy
by the by
Just surviving
in the public eye

You may think I'm strong
and I can do no wrong
but I'm vulnerable
so vulnerable without you
I may be hard to take
but you can't call me fake
'cause I'm vulnerable
so vulnerable
without you

You know I can't ever bear to seem weak
or have any doubts. That's just my technique
I put in the hours, at least I don't shirk
A little bravado does much of the work
I am no one's
stepping stone
but I couldn't live life
in private alone

You may think I'm strong
and I can do no wrong
but I'm vulnerable
so vulnerable without you
I may be hard to take
but you can't call me fake
'cause I'm vulnerable
so vulnerable
without you

At night
I am lying awake
Through the hours trying
to calculate
Am I good enough?
Can I contrive
to keep this show on the road?
Will I survive?

I know you must sometimes think I don't care
or even appreciate what we share
Though I'm no one's
stepping stone
the truth is I love you
and I'd go crazy alone

You may think I'm strong
and I can do no wrong
but I'm vulnerable
so vulnerable without you
I may be hard to take
but you can't call me fake
'cause I'm vulnerable
so vulnerable
without you
