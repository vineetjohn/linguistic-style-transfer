I'm not saying it was your fault
Although you could have done more
Oh you're so naive yet so

How could this be done
You're such a smiling sweetheart
Oh and your sweet and pretty face
In such an ugly way
Something so beautiful
That every time I look inside

I know that she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false it may be
She's still out to get me

I know that she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false it may be
She's still out to get me

I may say it was your fault
Cause I know you could have done more
Oh you're so naive yet so

How could this be done
By such a smiling sweetheart
Oh and your sweet and pretty face
In such an ugly way
Something so beautiful
Every time I look inside

I know that she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false it may be
She's still out to get me

I know that she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false it may be
She's still out to get me

Oooh...

So how could this be done
By such a smiling sweetheart
Oh you're so naive yet so

Such an ugly thing
Someone so beautiful
And every time you're on his side

I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false it may be 
She's still out to get me

And I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false it may be
She's still out to get me

Just don't let me down
Just don't let me down
Hold on to your pride
Just don't let me down
Just don't let me down
Hold on to your pride
Just don't let me down
Just don't let me down
Hold on to this pride
Just don't let me down
Just don't let me down
