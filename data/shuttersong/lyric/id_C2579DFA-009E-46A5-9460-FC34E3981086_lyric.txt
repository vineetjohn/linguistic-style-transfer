She got a body like an hourglass, but I can give it to you all the time
She got a booty like a Cadillac, but I can send you into overdrive (oh)
(Stop and wait, wait for that, stop, hold up, swing your bat)
See anybody could be bad to you, you need a good girl to blow your mind, yeah

Bang bang into the room (I know you want it)
Bang bang all over you (I'll let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute tell you (ah)
Bang bang there goes your heart (I know you want it)
Back, back seat of my car (I'll let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)

Wait a minute tell you (ah)

She might've let you hold her hand in school, but I'mma show you how to graduate
No, I don't need to hear you talk the talk, just come and show me what your momma gave (Oooh yeah)

(Your love gotta be baby, love but don't say a thing)
See anybody could be good to you, you need a bad girl to blow your mind

It's Myx moscato, it's frizz in a bottle
It's Nicki full throttle, it's oh, oh
Swimming in the grotto, we winning in the lotto
We dipping in the pot of blue foam
Kitten so good, it's dripping on wood
Get a ride in the engine that could go
Batman robbin' it, bang bang, cockin' it
Queen Nicki dominant, prominent
It's me, Jessie, and Ari, if they test me, they sorry

Ride us up like a Harley then pull off in this Ferrari
If he hanging we banging, phone ranging, he slanging
It ain't karaoke night but get the mic ‘cause he singing

(B to the A to the N to the G to the uh)
(B to the A to the N to the G to the hey)
See, anybody could be good to you
You need a bad girl to blow your mind

Bang, bang, bang, bang
