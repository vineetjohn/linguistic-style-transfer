I'm like a crow on a wire
You're the shining distraction that makes me fly
Oh, home
I'm like a boat on the water
You're the rays on the waves that calm my mind

Oh, every time
But I know in my heart, you're not a constant star
And yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet
Falling for you, fool's gold

And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret
falling for you, fool's gold
I'm the first to admit that I'm reckless
I get lost in your beauty

And I can't see two feet in front of me
And I know in my heart you're just a moving part
And yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet
Falling for you, fool's gold

And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret
falling for you, fool's gold
Yeah, I know your loves not real
That's not the way it feels

That's not the way you feel
And yes, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet
Falling for you, fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret
falling for you, fool's gold
