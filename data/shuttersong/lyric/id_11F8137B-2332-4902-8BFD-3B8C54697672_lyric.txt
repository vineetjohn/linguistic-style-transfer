So much for my happy ending
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

So much for my happy ending
(Oh, oh, oh)
Lets talk this over

It's not like we're dead
Was it something I did?
Was it something you said?
Don't leave me hanging
In a city so dead
Held up so high
On such a breakable thread
You were all the things I thought I knew

And I thought we could be
You were everything, everything

That I wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be
But we lost it
All of our memories so close to me
Just fade away
All this time you were pretending

So much for my happy ending
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
So much for my happy ending
(Oh, oh)
You've got your dumb friends

I know what they say
They tell you I'm difficult
But so are they
But they don't know me
Do they even know you?
All the things you hide from me
All the shit that you do?
You were all the things I thought I knew

And I thought we could be
You were everything, everything

That I wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be
But we lost it
All of our memories so close to me
Just fade away
All this time you were pretending

So much for my happy ending
It's nice to know that you were there
Thanks for acting like you cared
And making me feel like I was the only one
It's nice to know we had it all
Thanks for watching as I fall
And letting me know we were done
He was everything, everything
That I wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be
But we lost it
All of the memories so close to me
Just fade away
All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy ending
You were everything, everything
That I wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be
But we lost it
All of the memories so close to me
Just fade away
All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy ending
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
So much for my happy ending
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
So much for my happy ending
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
