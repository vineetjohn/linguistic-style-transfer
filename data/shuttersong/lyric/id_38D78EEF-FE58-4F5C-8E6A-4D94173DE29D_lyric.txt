Don't stray
Don't ever go away
I should be much too smart for this
You know it gets the better of me
Sometimes, when you and I collide

I fall into an ocean of you
Pull me out in time
Don't let me drown
Let me down
I say it's all because of you.

And here I go losing my control
I'm practicing your name
So I can say it to your face
It doesn't seem right
To look you in the eye.

Let all the things you mean to me
Come tumbling out my mouth
Indeed it's time
Tell you why
I say it's infinitely true.

Say you'll stay
Don't come and go like you do
Sway my way
Yeah I need to know
All about you.

And there's no cure
And no way to be sure
Why everythings turned inside out
Instilling so much doubt
It makes me so tired

I feel so uninspired
My head is battling with my heart
My logic has been torn apart
And now it all turns sour
Come sweeten every afternoon.

Say you'll stay
Don't come and go like you do
Sway my way
Yeah I need to know
All about you.

Say you'll stay
Don't come and go like you do
Sway my way
Yeah I need to know
All about you.

It's all because of you.
It's all because of you.

Now it all turns sour
Come sweeten every afternoon
It's time
Tell you why
I say it's Infinitely true.

Say you'll stay
Don't come and go like you do
Sway my way
Yeah I need to know
All about you.

Say you'll stay
Don't come and go like you do
Sway my way
Yeah I need to know
All about you.

It's all because of you
It's all because of you
It's all because of you.
