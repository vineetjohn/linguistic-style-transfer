Hot and dangerous
If you're one of us then roll with us
'Cause we make the hipsters fall in love
When we got our hot pants on and up

And yes of course we does
We runnin' this town just like a club
And no you don't wanna mess with us

Stockings ripped all up the side
Looking sick and sexy-fied
So let's go-o-o,

It's makin' my brain delirious

Sleepin' in cars
Dressin' it down
