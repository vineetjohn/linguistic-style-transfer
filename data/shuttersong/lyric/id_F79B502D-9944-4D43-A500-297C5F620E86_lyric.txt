Back against the wall
What the fuck just happened
Don't you cry
We've been here before
Breaking off taking action
No more lies

I'm not gonna blame this on you
I know I'll give it all I've got
No I'm not gonna blame this on you
I tell you that its not your fault

Honestly you're killing me
I'm sick of us wasting time
I took your heart
Tore it apart
Watching us die tonight

Play me for a fool
What the hell were you thinking all this time
Now I have to choose
'Cause I'm tired of thinking
Let me out

I'm not gonna blame this on you
I know I'll give it all I've got
No I'm not gonna blame this on you
I tell you that its not your fault

Honestly you're killing me
I'm sick of us wasting time
I took your heart
Tore it apart
Watching us die tonight

Everything will be alright
I'm watching us die tonight
Everything will be alright
I'm watching us die tonight

I'm not gonna blame this on you
I know I'll give it all I've got
No I'm not gonna blame this on you
I tell you that its not your fault
Honestly you're killing me
I'm sick of us wasting time
I took your heart
Tore it apart
Watching us die tonight
