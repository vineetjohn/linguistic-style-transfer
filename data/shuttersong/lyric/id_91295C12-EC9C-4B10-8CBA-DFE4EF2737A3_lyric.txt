I got my red dress on tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feeling alive

Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby you're the best

I've got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I've got that summertime
I've got that summertime
I've got that summertime
I've got that summertime
Summertime sadness
I've got that summertime
I've got that summertime
I've got that summertime
Summertime sadness

I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruising down the coast goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby you're the best

I've got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I've got that summertime
I've got that summertime
Summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Got that summertime
I've got that summertime
Summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
