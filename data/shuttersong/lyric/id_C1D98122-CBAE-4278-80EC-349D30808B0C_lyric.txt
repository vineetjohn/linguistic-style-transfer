 built this way
coz every man that I know makes me feel like I'm to blame
when it's over, me and my selfish  ways
go back to start again
go back to start again
Did you ever feel like you should have said
something smarter at the time
Did you ever feel like you should have kept
it all to yourself
Did you ever think it might be your fault
I never promised anymore
Did you ever think it might not be me
now it was always me
The look the dunks and the bottle of Jack
the smokes the slouch and my eyes back
you think you know what you think you'll find
you think you'll figure me out tonight
but you'll never know what I won't share
coz I don't care, no I don't care
you think you'll figure me out tonight
but I don't care
And I wonder, if I'm just  built  this  way
coz every man that I know makes me feel like I'm to blame
when it's over, me and my selfish  ways
go back to start again
And I wonder, if I'm just  built  this  way
coz every man that I know makes me feel like I'm to blame
when it's over, me and my selfish  ways
go back to start again
go back to start again
The look the dunks and the bottle of Jack
the smokes the slouch and my eyes back
you think you know what you think you'll find
you think you'll figure me out tonight
but you'll never know what I won't share
coz I don't care, no I don't care
you think you'll figure me out tonight
but I don't care
And I wonder, if I'm just  built  this  way
coz every man that I know makes me feel like I'm to blame
when it's over, me and my selfish  ways
go back to start again
And I wonder, if I'm just  built  this  way
coz every man that I know makes me feel like I'm to blame
when it's over, me and my selfish  ways
go back to start again
go back to start again
go back to start again
