If I told you I could give you life
Would you leave the boundaries of your mind?
I bet you never even knew,
That there’s a universe inside of you

Can I take your pain and make it go away
Would you let me be your getaway
No no no no, I bet you never knew
There’s a universe inside of you

Can I 
Undress you,
You, you,
Undress you,
You, you, 

Undress you,
You, you
Undress you,
You, you

Undress you.
 
There’s a universe inside of you. 

If I color you with all my thoughts
Would you lose your fears of being lost
I bet you never even knew 
I see the universe inside of you

Can I make you feel okay
Would you let me take you to a higher place
No no no no, I bet you never knew
There’s a universe inside of you

Can I 
Undress you,
You, you,
Undress you,
You, you, 

Undress you,
You, you
Undress you,
You, you

Undress you.
