Now dissolve me, two tabs on your tongue
A herd of shepherds to herd the sheep, sleep now my only one
Broken sweethearts who sleep apart
Both still pine for the other's side spine, spoon as sleep starts

And pulse to pulse, now shush
She makes the sound, the sound sea makes to calm me down
I am see-through, soap sliver you're so thin
As I begin rubbing lathers up your state worsens on my skin
And gold, fat-less finger to lip, one two three four hush

And pulse to pulse, now shush
She makes the sound, the sound sea makes to calm me down
She makes the sound, the sound sea makes, I'm tired now
Oooo-ooh
Ooh
Oooo-oooh
Ooooooh-ooh
Oooooooh
aaaaaaaaah
She makes the sound the sea makes, snee-deep in the North
She makes the sound the sea makes, snee-deep in the North
She makes the sound the sea makes, snee-deep in the North
She makes the sound the sea makes, snee-deep in the North
She makes the sound the sea makes, snee-deep in the North
She makes the sound the sea makes, snee-deep in the North
She makes the sound the sea makes, snee-deep in the North
She makes the sound the sea makes, snee-deep in the North
