First winter's snowfall
Throwing backyard snowballs
Warming up by the fireplace
Marshmallows catch fire on an open flame
All my friends get together
Wishing I was there but I'm never
Living in the sunshine oh but dreaming of a place called home

I wanna run wanna run away-ay
I'm dreaming of a place called home
I could try but I'm stuck here today
I'm dreaming of a place that's
3000 miles away
Feels like it's forever
Seems like yesterday
We were running 'round town together
This place, just ain't the same
I miss the stormy weather
I'm not okay
3000 miles away

You don't pick up but I keep redialing
Cause you're asleep got your phone on silent
Still early here I'm wide awake
I just wanna hear you tell me all about today
Although I never really showed it
I had to leave for me to notice
That living in the sunshine's cold I'm dreaming of a place called home

I wanna run wanna run away-ay
I'm dreaming of a place called home
I could try but I'm stuck here today
I'm dreaming of a place that's 3000 miles away
Feels like it's forever
Seems like yesterday
We were running 'round town together
This place, just ain't the same
I miss the stormy weather
I'm not okay, 3000 miles

If I could go back for the weekend
Or just for a day
To see familiar faces, that's all it would take
But it's too far

3000 miles away
Feels like it's forever
Seems like yesterday
We were running 'round town together
This place, just ain't the same
I miss the stormy weather
I'm not okay
3000 miles away

3000 miles away
Feels like it's forever
Seems like yesterday
We were running 'round town together
This place, just ain't the same
I miss the stormy weather
I'm not okay
3000 miles away
