Like walking into a dream, so unlike what
you've seen
so unsure but it seems, 'cause we've been
waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small
taste
of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back
here soon anyway
I see a distant light, but girl this can't be right
Such a surreal place to see so how did this
come to be
Arrived too early
And when I think of all the places I just don't
belong
I've come to grips with life and realize this is
going too far
I don't belong here, we gotta move on dear
escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right to move on and on
far away from here
A place of hope and no pain, perfect skies with
no rain
Can leave this place but ain, 'cause we've
been waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small
taste
of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back
here soon anyway
This peace on earth's not right (with my back
against the wall)
No pain or sign of time (I'm much too young to
fall)
So out of place don't wanna stay, I feel wrong
and that's my sign
I've made up my mind
Give me your hand but realize I just wanna say
goodbye
Please understand I have to leave and carry on
my own life
I don't belong here, I gotta move on dear
escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right to move on and on
far away from here
Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light, and I'd hope
you might
take me back inside when the time is right
Loved ones back home all crying 'cause they're
already missing me
I pray by the grace of God that there's
somebody listening
Give me a chance to be that person I wanna be
(Who are you?; I am unbroken; I'm choking on
this ecstasy)
Oh Lord I'll try so hard but you gotta let go of
(Unbreak me, unchain me, I need another
chance to live)
I don't belong here, I gotta move on dear
escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right to move on and on
far away from here
Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light, and I'd hope
you might
take me back inside when the time is right
