I feel, feel like a cokehead
I feel, feel like I can't get drunk no more
'Cause I'm on the floor
Looking for some matches just to cook up a score

I feel, feel like shooting up
I feel, feel like giving up on my skateboard
'Cause I'm fucking bored
I wanna perfect left and a sunset shore WOOOO

I feel, feel like a crackhead
I feel, feel like I'm not gonna make it no more
'Cause I'm on the floor
Just pick me up and give me some more

I feel, feel like I'm a grandpa
I feel, feel like I'm already 80 years old
And it's getting so cold
I need a new body and I need a new soul

I feel, feel like getting drunk
I feel, feel like fucking up my life
Again with all my friends
I hope we'll make it to the end

I feel, feel like shooting up
I feel, feel like I can't get laid no more
'Cause I'm on the floor
Just looking for some matches just to cook up a score WOOOOO
