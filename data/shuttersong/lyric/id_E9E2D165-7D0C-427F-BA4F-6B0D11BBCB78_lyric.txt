2AM Club - Worry About You
For as long  long as I can remember
It's been December
No sun  no summertime to treasure
We weren't grown
And every time that they told us surrender
"It will be better"
We'd just go holding on till forever
To what we know
Broken lover  yes I made you
Believe that I would be the one to heal you
And if you go now
Out that doorway
I won't say you're wrong
But you know that I'll worry about you
For as long  long as she can remember
She wanted better
No home  no one there to protect her
All alone
And so she told me  I was her center
Nothing would tempt her
I still roamed
Just like her father left her
Oohh he left her
Broken lover  yes I made you
Believe that I would be the one to heal you
And if you go now
Out that doorway
I won't say you're wrong
But you know that I'll worry about you
Isn't it bad you've been a good victim
You thought I was worth it you act like I would listen
And maybe you were right at one point someday
I used to watch you treat the streets like a runway
I used to write with tears on your pretty painted face
Sign language on your back from the first taste
So when he whispers in your ear and you think of me
You wish I would've treated you like you treated me
When you wake up from your dreams to the hallway
Sleepwalking through the streets dressed in all gray
Blinking streetlamps in the window pane
I worried from the second that I learned your name
Everything in love is light
But where was I last night
And why don't you feel right
Broken lover yes I made you
Believe that I would be the one to heal you
And if you go now
Out that doorway
I won't say you're wrong
But you know that I'll worry about you
Broken lover yes I made you
Believe that I would be the one to heal you
And if you go now
Out that doorway
I won't say you're wrong
But you know that I'll worry about you
