I used to think
I had the answers to everything
But now I know
Life doesn't always
Go my way, yeah
Feels like I'm caught in the middle
That's when I realize

I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
All I need is time
A moment that is mine

While I'm in between

I'm not a girl
There is no need to protect me
Its time that I
Learn to face up to this on my own

I've seen so much more than u know now
Don't tell me to shut my eyes

I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman

All I need is time
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between

I'm not a girl

But if u look at me closely
You will see it my eyes
This girl will always find
Her way

I'm not a girl
(I'm not a girl don't tell me what to believe)

Not Yet a woman
(I'm just tryin to find the woman in me, yeah)
All I need is time (All I need)
A moment that is mine (That is mine)
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
All I need is time (is All I need)
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman.
