Where you off to with that head of yours?
Is there somewhere you should be?
Was it something that I said the time I held you down
And told you it's not you, it's only me? Maybe

Don't take what I don't need
(Give me back my piece of mind)
Don't say what I don't mean
(Give me back my precious time)
No way you'll silence me, you'll see

What you up to now your mirror's gone?
Is there someone you should be?
Did you think I was just fooling 'round with you?
But honestly,
But honestly,
But honestly

Don't take what I don't need
(Give me back my piece of mind)
Don't say what I don't mean
(Give me back my precious time)
No way you'll silence me
(Give me back my piece of mind)
Nowhere to hide from me, you'll see

And tonight I thank the stars
As I count my lucky scars
For everything you've given me

And all the words I gave to you
Something borrowed, something blue
If you want them back

I'll give it to you, give it to you
Give it to you, I'll give it to you
Give it to you, give it to you
Give it to you, I'll give it to you

I'll give it to you, give it to you
Give it to you, I'll give it to you
I'll give it to you, give it to you
I'll give it to you, give it to you

I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
