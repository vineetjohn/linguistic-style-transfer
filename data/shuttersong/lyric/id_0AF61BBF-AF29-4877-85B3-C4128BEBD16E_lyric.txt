Sugar pie, honey bunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else

In and out my life
You come and you go
Leaving just your picture behind
And I kissed it a thousand times

When you snap your finger or wink your eye
I come a-running to you
I'm tied to your apron strings
And there's nothing that I can do

Can't help myself
No, I cant help myself

Sugar pie, honey bunch
I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself
I'm a fool in love you see

Wanna tell you I don't love you
Tell you that we're through
And I've tried but every time I see your face
I get all choked up inside

When I call your name
Girl, it starts the flame
Burning in my heart, tearing it all apart
No matter how I try, my love I cannot hide

'Cause sugar pie, honey bunch
You know that I'm weak for you
Can't help myself
I love you and nobody else

Sugar pie, honey bunch
Do anything you ask me to
Can't help myself
I want you and nobody else

Sugar pie, honey bunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
