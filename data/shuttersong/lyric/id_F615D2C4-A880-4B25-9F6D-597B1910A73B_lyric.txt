Nothing but a tear, that's all for breakfast
Watching you pretend you're unaffected
You're pulling our connections, expecting me to let you go
But I won't

I know you don't need my protection
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction, hoping that the message goes

Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close if they hurt you, you wouldn't find out
Just say now, I'm coming right now, very close to you

Said you let it go, you kept it
Working hard to perfect it
But now your fear is reckless, and it's out of your control
Well just let it go

I know you don't need my protection
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction, hoping that the message goes

Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close, if they hurt you, you wouldn't find out
If you let me, I'd be there by now
Close to you
