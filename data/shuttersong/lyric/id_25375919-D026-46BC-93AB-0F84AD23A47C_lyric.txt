Marry You - Bruno Mars
It's a beautiful night we're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes or is it this dancing juice
Who cares baby I think I wanna marry you
Well I know this little chapel on the boulevard
We can go whoa whoa
No one will know whoa
Oh come on girl
Who cares if we're trashed
Got a pocket full of cash we can blow whoa whoa
Shots of patron whoa whoa
And it's on girl
Don't say no no no no no
Just say yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
And we'll go go go go go
If you're ready like I'm ready
Cause it's a beautiful night we're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes or is it this dancing juice
Who cares baby I think I wanna marry you
Oh
I'll go get the ring
Let the choir bell sing like ooh ooh ooh
So what you wanna do ooh ooh
Let's just run girl
If we wake up and you wanna break up
That's cool ooh ooh
No I won't blame you ooh ooh
It was fun girl
Don't say no no no no no
Just say yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
And we'll go go go go go
If you're ready like I'm ready
Cause it's a beautiful night we're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes or is it this dancing juice
Who cares baby I think I wanna marry you
Just say I do ooh ooh ooh
Tell me right now baby
Tell me right now baby baby
Just say I do ooh ooh ooh
Tell me right now baby
Tell me right now baby baby
Oh
It's a beautiful night we're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes or is it this dancing juice
Who cares baby I think I wanna marry you
