Oh  it's a strange day
In such a lonely way
I saw some children dance
I watched my life in a trance
And the people around me
Seemed so glad to be here
Will my time pass so slowly
On the day that I fear 
And the noise that surrounds me
Pulls so loud in my head
From the promise that healed us
To the lies that I said
Oh  it's a strange day
In such a lonely way
Some people look down on me 
I know they like what they see
Strange day 
Such a strange day
Such a strange day
END
