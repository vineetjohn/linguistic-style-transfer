Viceroy, early in the morning
Just trying to let the sun in
And open up my eyes

Viceroy, as it's getting later
Heading for the corner
Already running dry

And oh don't let me see you crying
'Cause oh honey i'll smoke you 'til i'm dying

Viceroy, don't take me for a fool now
I'm only trying to calm down
Just trying to keep it cool

Viceroy, as it's getting later
Heading for the corner
I'm leaving it to you
And oh don't let me see you crying
'Cause oh honey i'll smoke you 'til i'm dying
