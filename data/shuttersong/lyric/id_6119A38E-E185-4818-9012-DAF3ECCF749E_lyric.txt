It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
A kind of magic
One dream, one soul, one prize, one goal
One golden glance of what should be (it's a kind of magic)
One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day (it's a kind of magic)
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time (it's a kind of magic)
The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity
Is this a kind of magic? (it's a kind of magic)
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done
This flame that burns inside of me

I'm hearing secret harmonies (it's a kind of magic)
The bell that rings inside your mind

Is challenging the doors of time
It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be, will soon be, will soon be done
This is (this is) a kind (a kind) of magic (yeah)
There can be only one (one one one)
This rage that lasts a thousand years

Will soon be done (done)
Magic (it's a kind of magic)
It's a kind of magic
Magic magic magic magic
Ha ha ha haa - it's magic

Ha haa
Yeah yeah
Wooh
It's a kind of magic mati
