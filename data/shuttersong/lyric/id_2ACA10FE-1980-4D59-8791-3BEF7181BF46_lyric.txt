Ay, ah what the fuck you think?
A record by Pussycat Dolls
Featuring Busta Rhymes is gonna sound like
Ok-ok-ok-ok (ah)
Yeah-yeah... (ah)
Oh, we about to get it just a lil' hot and sweaty in this muh'fucka (ooh baby)
Ladies let's go (uh)
Soldiers let's go (dolls)
Let me talk to y'all and just you know give you a little situation
Listen-listen... (fellas)

You see this shit get hot
Every time I come through when I step up in the spot
(Are you ready?)
Make the place sizzle like a summertime cookout
Prowl for the best chick
Yes I'm on the lookout
(Let's dance)

Slow bangin' shorty like a belly dancer with it
Smell good pretty skin so gangsta with it (Ooh baby)
No tricks only diamonds under my sleeve
Gimme the number
But make sure you call before you leave

I know you like me
(I know you like me)
I know you do (I know you do)
That's why whenever I come around she's all over you
And I know you want it
(I know you want it)
It's easy to see
(it's easy to see)
And in the back of your mind I know you should be fuckin' with me
(h-a-a-a...) Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?
Don't cha?

Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me?
Don't cha?

Fight the feeling
(fight the feeling)
Leave it alone
(leave it alone)
¡®Cause if it ain't love it just ain't enough to leave a happy home
(uh-uh uh-uh)

Let's keep it friendly
(let's keep it friendly)
You have to play fair
(you have to play fair)
See I don't care
But I know she ain't gonna wanna share
(uh-uh uh-uh)
M-m-m-m... m-m-m-m...

Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
(Oh) Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me? (Like me)

Well let me get straight to it
Every broad wan watch a nigga when I come through it
It's the God Almighty lookin' all brand new
Shorty wanna jump in my ass then vanjewish

Lookin' at me all like she really wanna do it
Tryna put it on me 'til my balls black an' blueish
Ya wanna play wit a playa girl then play on
Strip out the Chanel and leave the lingerie on

Watch me and I'm a watch you at the same time
Lookin' at ya wan break my back
You the very reason why I keep a pack uh the Magnum
An' wit the wagon hit chu in the back uh the Magnum

For the record don't think it was somethin' you did
Shorty ya all on me ¡®cuz it's hard to resist the kid
I got a idea that's dope for y'all
As y'all could get so I could hit the both of y'all
I know she loves you
(I know she loves you)
I understand
(I understand)
I probably be just as crazy about you if you were my old man
Maybe next lifetime
(maybe next lifetime)
Possibly (possibly)
Until then old friend your secret is safe with me
(h-a-a-a...) Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
(Oh) Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me? (Like me)
