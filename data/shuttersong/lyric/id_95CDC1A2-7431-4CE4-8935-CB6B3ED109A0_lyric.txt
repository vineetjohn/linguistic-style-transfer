Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say...

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile

The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl you're amazing just the way you are
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me

Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Oh, you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say...

'Cause girl you're amazing just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl you're amazing just the way you are

The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl you're amazing just the way you are... yeah...
