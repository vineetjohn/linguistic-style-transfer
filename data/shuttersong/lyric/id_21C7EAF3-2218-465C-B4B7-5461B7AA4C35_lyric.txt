Nothing can separate
Even if I run away
Your love never fails
I know I'll still make mistakes
You have new mercy for me every day
Cause Your love never fails

You stay the same through the ages
Your love never changes
There may be pain in the night
But joy comes in the morning
And when the oceans rage
I don't have to be afraid
Because I know that You love me
Your love never fails
Oh no, no, no

When the storm and the water's deep
I'm not alone here in these open seas
Cause Your love never fails
The chasm is far too wide
I never thought I'd reach the other side
Your love never fails
Oh no, oh no

Yeah, You stay the same through the ages
Your love never changes
There may be pain in the night
But joy comes in the morning
And when the oceans rage
I don't have to be afraid
Because I know that You love me
Your love never fails

You make all things
Work together for my good
(God, You never fail me)
You make all things
Work together for my good
(no You never fail me)

You make all things
Work together for my good
(God, You never fail me)
You make all things
Work together for my good
(no You never fail me)

You make all things
Work together for my good
(God, You never fail me)
You make all things
Work together for my good
(no You never fail me)

You stay the same through the ages
Your love never changes
There may be pain in the night
But joy comes in the morning
And when the oceans rage
I don't have to be afraid
Because I know that You love me
Your love never fails
Cause Your love never fails
