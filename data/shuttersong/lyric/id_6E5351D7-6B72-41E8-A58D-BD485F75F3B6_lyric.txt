Moment of honesty,
Someones gotta take the lead tonight
Whose it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here and tell u while it comes to me
If u have something to say
You should say it right now
(You should say it right now)

You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
Its become something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable will it make us look crazy
If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready)

I know u said to me
This is exactly how it should feel when its meant to be
Time is only wasting so why wait for eventually
If we gonna do something about it
We should do it right now
(We should do it right now)

You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
Its become something that's impossible to ignore
Its what we make it

I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable
Will it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful
Either way I'm sayin
If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready)

Sayin
I give up before we try
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away (fly away)
I can't say I can't compare
I'm suspended it the air
Won't u come be in the sky with me
