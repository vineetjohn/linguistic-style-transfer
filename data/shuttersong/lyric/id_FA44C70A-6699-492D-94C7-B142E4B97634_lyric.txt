Merrily we fall out of line, out of line.
I'd fall anywhere with you
I'm by your side.

Swinging in the rain
Humming melodies.
We're not going anywhere until we freeze.

I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid.

Forever is a long time
But I wouldn't mind spending it by your side.

Carefully we'll place for our destiny.
You came and you took this heart
And set it free.
Every word you write and sing is so warm to me
So warm to me.
I'm torn, I'm torn.
To be right where you are.

I'm not afraid anymore.
I'm not afraid.

Forever is a long time.
But I wouldn't mind spending it by your side.
Tell me everyday
I get to wake up to that smile.
I wouldn't mind it at all.
I wouldn't mind it at all.

You so know me.
Pinch me gently.
I can hardly breathe.
Forever is a long, long time.
But I wouldn't mind spending it by your side.
Tell me, everyday I get to wake up to that smile.
I wouldn't mind it at all
I wouldn't mind it at all
