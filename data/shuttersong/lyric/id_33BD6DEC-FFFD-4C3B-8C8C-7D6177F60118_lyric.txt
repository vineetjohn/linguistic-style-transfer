"All I Want Is You"

Sitting here, all alone
Watching the snow fall
Looking back at the days
We threw them snow balls
I can't believe
I'm putting the tree up by myself
I need you
And nobody else

And I'm sorry
If I pushed you away
Cause I need you here
And I want for you to know

And I don't care, if I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you
This christmas, this christmas, this christmas
All I want is you
This christmas (I'm sorry),
This christmas (if I hurt you),
This christmas (but I know that),
All I want is you this christmas

And I never wanna do this alone
Baby I just need you to be here
Here through the holidays
I just wanna know if you feel same way
Because I'm lonely baby
Want you to hold me baby

And I'm sorry
If I pushed you away
I just want you to know I miss you
And I want you to stay

And I don't care, if I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you
This christmas, this christmas, this christmas
All I want is you
This christmas (I'm sorry),
This christmas (if I hurt you),
This christmas (but I know that),
All I want is you this christmas

Wrapping gifts without you babe
Is like mid-December and there's no cold
I can't do this on my own
I've changed my ways
Keep running back and forth again
I'm here to stay

And I don't care, if I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you
This christmas, this christmas, this christmas
All I want is you
This christmas (I'm sorry),
This christmas (if I hurt you),
This christmas (but I know that),
All I want is you this christmas
