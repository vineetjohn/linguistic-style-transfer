Kiss Me - Ed Sheeran
Settle down with me
Cover me up  cuddle me in
Lie down with me  yeah
And hold me in your arms
And your heart's against my chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes but
They don't know me yet
And with a feeling I'll forget
I'm in love now
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love  falling in love
Settle down with me
And I'll be your safety
You'll be my lady
I was made to keep your body warm
But I'm cold as the wind blows
So hold me in your arms
My heart's against your chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes
But they don't know me yet
And with this feeling I'll forget
I'm in love now
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love  falling in love
Yeah I've been feeling everything
From hate to love from love to
Lust from lust to truth
I guess that's how I know you
So hold you close to help you give it up
So kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love  falling in love
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love  falling in love
