Your love is like a studded leather headlock
Your kiss, it could put creases in the rain
You're rarer than a can of dandelion & burdock
& those other girls are just postmix lemonade

Suck it & see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me, 'cause I'm a fool for you

I poured my aching heart into a pop song
I couldn't get the hang of poetry
That's not a skirt girl, that's a sawn-off shotgun
& I can only hope, you've got it aimed at me

Suck it & see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me, 'cause I'm a fool for

Blue moon girls from once upon a Shangri-la
How I often wonder where you are
You have got that face that just says
"Baby, I was made to break your heart"

Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Go, go, go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me cause I'm a fool for you
