Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
 
The snow blows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
and it looks like I'm the Queen
 
The wind is howling
like the swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in,
Heaven knows I tried
 
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel
Don't let them know
Well, now they know
 
Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
 
And here I stand
and here I'll stay
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway
 
It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all
 
Up here in the cold thin air
I finally can breathe
I know I left a life behind
But I'm too relieved to grieve
 
Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
 
And here I stand
and here I'll stay
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway
 
Standing frozen
in the life I've chosen
You won't find me
The past is all behind me
Buried in the snow
 
Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
 
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand
and here I'll stay
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway
