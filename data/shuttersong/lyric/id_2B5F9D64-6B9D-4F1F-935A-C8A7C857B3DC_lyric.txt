I sit and wait
Does an angel contemplate my fate
And do they know
The places where we go
When we're grey and old
'Cause I've been told
That salvation lets their wings unfold
So when I'm lying in my bed
Thoughts running through my head

And I feel the love is dead
I'm loving Angels instead
And through it all
She offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me

When I come to call

She won't forsake me
I'm loving Angels instead
When I'm feeling weak
And my pain walks down a one way street
I look above
And I know I'll always be blessed with love

And as the feeling grows
She breathes flesh my bones

And I feel the love is dead
I'm loving Angels instead
And through it all
She offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me

When I come to call
She won't forsake me
I'm loving Angels instead

oh, oh, oh, oh
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
oh, oh, oh
yeah, yeah, yeah
And through it all
She offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call
She won't forsake me
I'm loving Angels instead
