Lost in the day, in a way

It's the same a the one before this

And I wish I could say

That's it's all black and white

But it's grey, it's the same

It's the same and I'm so tired

But you are what I'm coming home to

Oh and I'm thinking abouta a red wine buzz and takin' it easy

And I got you in my arms, takin' a break from crazy

And I'll say hey, you'll say baby, how's ur day

I'll say crazy, but it's all gonna be alright

You'll kiss my smile, I'll pull you closer, spend a while

Just getting to know ya, but it's gonna be all alright

I'm loving you tonight, loving you tonight

And you are there on my heart, at the start

Of my every morning and I can't deny

By the end of the day that I'm running on empty

But you make me full, steal my breath

You're so unpredictable, that's what I'm coming home to

Oh I'm dreaming about a romance, slow dancing with you

When I got you in arms, I don't care what we do

Every day is just the in-between

The hours separating you from me

I know you'll be waiting, I know you'll be waiting
