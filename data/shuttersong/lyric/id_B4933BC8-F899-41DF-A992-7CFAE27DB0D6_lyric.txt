"This Is What It Takes"

I watch your troubled eyes as you rest,
And I fall in love with every breath.
Wonder if those eyes are really shut,
And am I the one you're dreaming of?

'Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen.
And I know this 'cause I've noticed
A little bit shining through the seams.

And if this is what it takes,
Then let me be the one to bare the pain.
Ooh if this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way,
If this is what it takes.

You keep on telling me I'm wasting time,
But to call it wasting time oh that's a crime.
And you think it's crazy what I'm trying t'do.
Well baby, I'm a fool for you.

'Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen.
And I know this 'cause I've noticed
A little bit shining through the seams, yeah

And if this is what it takes,
Then let me be the one to bare the pain.
Ooh if this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way,

'Cause if you don't understand yet
Then I'll never let you forget
That you don't have to do this on your own.

I'll be your shoulder to lean on.
I'll be your right when you feel wrong.
So come on, take my hand, we're moving on.

And if this is what it takes,
Then let me be the one to bare the pain.
Ooh and if this is what it takes,
Then I'll break down these walls,
These walls that are in our way.
If this is what it takes.
