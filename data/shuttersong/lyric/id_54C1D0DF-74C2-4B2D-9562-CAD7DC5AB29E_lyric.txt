You put me on a roller coaster, fly me on a plane
You send me to another planet, get inside my brain
I knew right when I met you I would never be the same
But I let you take me over, Girl, so I'm the one to blame Oh

You…Make all my screws come….loose Got me perfectly con….fused
Always to find a way to mess me up and drive me wild
I love the way you make me lose my mind
Lose my mind
You make me crazy and I kinda like it

You show me that apple girl and I want to bite it
So crazy that I gotta have it
and I never wanna get out of this straitjacket
You…Make all my screws come….loose

Got me perfectly con….fused
Always to find a way to mess me up and drive me wild
I love the way you make me lose my…
I feel the walls closing in inside this padded room

Only good thing about it is I'm locked in here with you, yeah
I'm always watching you, wondering what you'll do next
But my favorite part about it is I always have to guess (you know i do)
You…Make all my screws come….loose
Got me perfectly con….fused

Always to find a way to mess me up and drive me wild
I love the way you make me lose my mind
Make me Lose my mind
Lose my mind
Make me lose my mind
make me lose my mind
Lose my mind
