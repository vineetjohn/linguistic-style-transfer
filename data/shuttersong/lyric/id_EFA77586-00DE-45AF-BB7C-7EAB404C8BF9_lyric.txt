Living in a city of sleepless people
Who all know the limits and won't go too far outside the lines
Cause they're out of their minds.
I wanna get out and build my own home
On a street where reality is not much different from dreams I've had
A dream is all I have...
Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming
Daydreaming into the night
Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming
Daydreaming into the night
And I'm alright
Creep past the hours like the shorter hand on the clock
Hanging on a wall of a schoolhouse somewhere
We wait for the bell
And we dream of somewhere else
Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming
Daydreaming into the night
Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming
Daydreaming into the night
And I'm alright
It's not that I won't remember where I'm from
Just don't wanna be here no more
It's not enough
(We're only half alive)
I'm gonna go
(We're only half alive)
Where the rest of the dreamers go
(We're only half alive)
Where the dreamers go
Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time ('til the sunrise)
Daydreaming
Daydreaming into the night
And I'm alright
Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time ('til the sunrise)
Daydreamer
We used to be half alive
Now I'm alright
I'm alright
I'm alright
