Black stripes, yellow paint,
Them niggas scared of it but them hoes ain't
Soon as I hit the club look at them hoes face
Hit the pedal once make the floor shake
Suede insides, my engine roarin'
It's the big boy you know what I payed for it
And I got the pedal to the metal
I got you niggas checkin' game I'm ballin' out on every level

Hear them haters talk but there's nothing you can tell 'em
Just made a million got another million on my schedule

No love for 'em nigga breakin' hearts
No keys, push to start

Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh screamin' that's nothin'

Got a call from my jeweler this just in
Them bitches love me 'cause I'm fuckin' with their best friends
Not a lesbian but she a freak though
This ain't for one night I'm shinin' all weak hoe

I'm sippin' cleeko and rockin' yellow diamonds
So many rocks up in the watch I cant tell what the time is
Got a pocket full of big faces
Throw it up 'cause every nigga that I'm with be taylor'd

Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh screamin' that's nothin'

Reppin' my town when you see me you know everything

Stay high like how I'm supposed to do
That crowd underneath them clouds,
Can't get close to you
And my car look unapproachable
Super clean but its super mean
She wanna fuck with them cats,
Smoke weed, count stacks, get fly,
Take trips and that's that
Real rap, I let her get high,
She wouldn't she feel that,
Convertible drop fill, eighty seven the top peel, back
