When I was in the 3rd grade
I thought that I was gay
'Cause I could draw, my uncle was
And I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, "Ben you've loved girls since before pre-K"
Tripping yeah
I guess she had a point, didn't she
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like
"Yeah, I'm good at little league"
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God
Ahh nah, here we go
America the brave
Still fears what we don't know
And God loves all his children it's somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written
35 hundreds years ago
I don't know

And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm


She keeps me warm

She keeps me warm

If I was gay
I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
"Man that's gay"
Gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're saying
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots
Behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate
Yet our genre still ignores it
Gay is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color
The complexion of your pigment
The same fight that lead people to walk-outs and sit-ins
Human rights for everybody
There is no difference
Live on! And be yourself!
When I was in church
They taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service
Those words aren't anointed
And that Holy Water
That you soak in
Is then poisoned
When everyone else
Is more comfortable
Remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans
That have had their rights stolen

I might not be the same

But that's not important

No freedom til we're equal
Damn right I support it

I don't know
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change

Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love

She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

We press play
Don't press pause
Progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes
We turn our back on the cause
'Till the day
That my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walkin' around the hallway
Plagued by pain in their heart
A world so hateful

Some would rather die

Than be who they are
And a certificate on paper
Isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start

No law's gonna change us

We have to change us
Whatever God you believe in
We come from the same one
Strip away the fear

Underneath it's all the same love

About time that we raised up

And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change

Even if I tried

Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
