Yeah.

Yeah.

That's how you had it, yeah,
Pretty sure.

It is, it's goes clapping a bit.

Something just in that way,
Alright, here we go.

You go up and down this time.

I'm writing the future,
I'm writing it out, loud.
We don't talk about the past,
We don't talk about the past now.

So, I'm writing the future,
I'm leaving a key here.
Something won't always be missing,
You won't always feel emptier.

Ah-ah, mm-mm,
Ah-ah-ah-ah, mm-mm.

Just think of the future,
And think of your dreams.
You'll get away from here,
You'll get away eventually.

So, just think of the future,
Think of a new life.
And don't get lost in the memories,
Keep your eyes on a new prize.

Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah,
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah,
Mm.
