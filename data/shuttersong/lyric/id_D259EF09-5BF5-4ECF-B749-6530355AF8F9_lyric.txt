So I hit the road and end up in a yardy party
Baby was moving like like a naughty shorty
Need discipline, she need discipline
Need to put her on a lockdown no visiting
Bring 'em down yea
Handcuffs maintain the connection
Dis baton is a rod of correction
Discipline, she need discipline
Need to put her on a lockdown no visiting
