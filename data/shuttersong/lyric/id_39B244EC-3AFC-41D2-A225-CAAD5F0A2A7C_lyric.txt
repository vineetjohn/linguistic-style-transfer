Bubble pop, bubble pop, bubble pop,

You make think it's strange or derange how I make it bounce
Sugar sweet just like a candy cane melting in your mouth
Cotton cover lemon drops make it hard I'll make it pop
Once I'll show you how you'll never get enough

[Chorus]
I got my bubble, hey, I got my bubble, hey hey
I got my bubble, yeah, I make my bubble pop
I got my bubble, hey, I got my bubble, hey hey
I got my bubble, yeah, I make my bubble pop

For you I'll make it pop
For you for you
I'll make it pop
For you I'll make it pop

Boy don't be afraid of the way that I captivate
Sticky if you touch it, might get lost and you can't escape
Cherry flavored? yummy yum, boy be nice I'll give you some
Of my tasty cake i know you love soo much

[Chorus]
I got my bubble, hey, I got my bubble, hey hey
I got my bubble, yeah, I make my bubble pop
I got my bubble, hey, I got my bubble, hey hey
I got my bubble, yeah, I make my bubble pop

For you I'll make it pop
For you, for you
I'll make it pop
For you I'll make it pop

Come get lost with me
I dare you to try-ey-yy-ey-yy-ey-yy
Come get lost with me
I dare you to try-ey-yy-ey-yy-ey-yy

[Chorus]
I got my bubble, hey, I got my bubble, hey hey
I got my bubble, yeah, I make my bubble pop
I got my bubble, hey, I got my bubble, hey hey
I got my bubble, yeah, I make my bubble pop

For you I'll make it pop
For you for you

For you I'll make it pop

Come get lost with me

Come get lost with me

[Chorus]
I got my bubble, hey, I got my bubble, hey hey

I got my bubble, hey, I got my bubble, hey hey
I got my bubble, yeah, I make my bubble pop

For you for you

For you I'll make it pop
