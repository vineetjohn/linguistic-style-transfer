Save my life, woah
Do you feel like a tear-drop in the ocean?
Can you feel the dark force in the air?
Is it hard when you get up, to get back in the moment?
and you're not moving anywhere
Do they tell you dreams slowly surrender?
To what is easy and in front of your face
if you're scared you're going down, and you're never getting out
then this is what you gotta say.

Saving my life, saving my life, saving my life
I'm saving my life, saving my life, saving my life
I'm saving my life, saving my life, saving my life

I'm saving my life, saving my life saving my life
I'm saving
Saving my life, saving my life, saving my life

I'm saving my life, saving my life, saving my life (Saving)
Saving my life, saving my life, saving my life
I'm saving my life, saving my life, saving my life

Are you stuck in a rat race that you won't win?
Are you scared that you'll never wake up?
Will they make you punch in, when you're there in the morning
and punch out when they've had enough?

There's a life and it's out there for the taking
You can run and you leave this behind
They'll tell you it's a trap, and they caught you in the act

ain't nothing but a state of mind.
I'm saving
Saving my life, saving my life, saving my life

I'm saving my life, saving my life, saving my life (Saving)
Saving my life, saving my life saving my life
I'm saving my life, saving my life, saving my life

I'm saving
Saving my life, saving my life, saving my life (Saving)
Saving my life, saving my life, saving my life

I'm saving my life, saving my life, saving my life
Save all of your time and
Save all you been hiding
Save all your energy

Save all you've been dreaming
Live life with some meaning
