This is to the ones who broke our hearts
This is to the ones who played a part
In making our lives a living hell
This is to the voices in our heads
This is to the ones who always said
We wouldn't amount to anything

So what if we're not perfect
And so what, we know we're worth it

Listen up, here's our song
For the young, the lost and the underdogs
We're taking over
We're taking over
We get it right and we get it wrong
But we got used to staying strong
We're taking over
We're taking over now, now, now, yeah

This is for the ones who you walk by
This if for the ones who took their lives
It gets better, give it time
This is for the girls who like chicks
And this is for the guys who like chick flicks
Baby, the world is yours and mine

So what if we're not perfect
And so what, we know we're worth it

Listen up, here's our song
For the young, the lost and the underdogs
We're taking over
We're taking over
We get it right and we get it wrong
But we got used to staying strong
We're taking over
We're taking over now, now, now, yeah

We're still standing, we're still breathing
We're still fighting, we're not leaving
Let me see you, if you hear me, sing along
We're still standing, we're still breathing
We're still fighting, we're not leaving
Let me see you, if you hear me, sing along

Listen up, here's our song
For the young, the lost and the underdogs
We're taking over
We're taking over
We get it right and we get it wrong
But we got used to staying strong
We're taking over
We're taking over now, now, now, yeah
We're taking over now, now, now, yeah
We're taking over now
