I found a love that swept me off of my feet
Found a baby, she's the finest thing this boy had ever seen

She's pick you up
And make you wanna fall hard
When I step out on the scene
They shout "Oh, my God!"

She's so unreal
She lets me take her home
Let my body love your body, baby
All night long

I wanna write a song about you now, yeah
Something that would make you wanna start
I wanna write a song about you now, yeah
Something from the bottom of my heart

I wanna take ya home
I wanna take ya home

Damn, this girl, can't find nobody like her
She is everything I want and I'd do anything for her
I'd beg, beg, and beg
Make me believe that there is no one else I need
When you satisfy me

I'll take you home
We can be alone
And let my body show you lovin' like its never ever known

I wanna write a song about you now, yeah
Something that would make you wanna start
I wanna write a song about you now, yeah
Something from the bottom of my heart

I wanna take ya home tonight, alone
Take you places you've never known
Keep you coming right back for more
Keep you coming right back for more

I wanna take ya home tonight, alone
Take you places you've never known
Keep you coming right back for more
Keep you coming right back for more, more, more, yeah

I wanna write a song about you now
Something that would make you wanna start
I wanna write a song about you now, yeah
Something from the bottom of my heart
I wanna take ya home tonight, alone
Take you places you've never known
Keep you coming right back for more
Keep you coming right back
I wanna write a song about you now, yeah
From the bottom of my heart
From the bottom of my heart
