It's been said and done
Every beautiful thought's been already sung
And I guess right now here's another one
So your melody will play on and on, with the best of them
You are beautiful, like a dream come alive, incredible
A sinful, miracle, lyrical
You've saved my life again
And I want you to know baby

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat (oh oh oh)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (oh oh oh)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (oh oh oh)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (oh oh oh)
And I keep hitting repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat

Constantly, boy you played through my mind like a symphony
There's no way to describe what you do to me
You just do to me, what you do
And it feels like I've been rescued
I've been set free
I am hypnotized by your destiny
You are magical, lyrical, beautiful
You are... And I want you to know baby

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting re-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat (oh oh)
I, I love you like a (love song baby) love song, baby (oh oh)
I, I love you like a (love song baby) love song, baby (oh oh)
I, I love you like a (I love you, I love you) love song, baby
And I keep hitting re-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat (like a love song)

No one compares
You stand alone, to ever record I own
Music to my heart that's what you are
A song that goes on and on

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
(I love you) I, I love you like a love song, baby (I love you) (like a love song)
And I keep hitting re-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat (like a love song)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (oh oh)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (oh oh)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (I love you)
I love you like a love song
