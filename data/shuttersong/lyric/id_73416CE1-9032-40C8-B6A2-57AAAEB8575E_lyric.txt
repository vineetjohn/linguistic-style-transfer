Can't let you go
Walk out the door
Can't hold you out
When I want more
When I am down
You make it right
When I am stupid
You're taking my side

And when I cry
You make me smile
When I am crazy and out of my mind
You hold me tight
Won't let me go
Oh baby this time I know for sure

This is the night, it's the night
It's tonight, it's for real
Can you tell what I'm thinking,
See what I see
Feel my pulse yeah, beating so hard
What happens tonight girl
Happens in the dark

It's the night, it's tonight can't you see
Turn the lights out, it's just you and me
Feel my pulse yeah, beating so hard
What happens tonight girl
Happens in the dark

When I'm with you
I feel secure
When I'm alone I don't feel whole
You got my heart
And that's alright
You've kept me warm
All this time

It must be love
One of a kind
I would be crazy for leaving your side
If you just stay
I'll show the way
Cause baby this time I know for sure

This is the night, it's the night
It's tonight, it's for real
Can you tell what I'm thinking,
See what I see
Feel my pulse yeah, beating so hard
What happens tonight girl
Happens in the dark

It's the night, it's tonight can't you see
Turn the lights out, it's just you and me
Feel my pulse yeah, beating so hard
What happens tonight girl
Happens in the dark

This is the night, the night
Tonight it's for real
We're so right, so right
So good can't you see
This is the night, the night
Tonight it's for real
Can you tell what I'm thinking
Tell what I'm thinking

This is the night, it's the night
It's tonight, it's for real
Can you tell what I'm thinking,
See what I see
Feel my pulse yeah, beating so hard
What happens tonight girl
Happens in the dark

It's the night, it's tonight can't you see
Turn the lights out, it's just you and me
Feel my pulse yeah, beating so hard
What happens tonight girl
Happens in the dark
What happens tonight girl
Happens in the dark
What happens tonight girl
Happens in the dark
