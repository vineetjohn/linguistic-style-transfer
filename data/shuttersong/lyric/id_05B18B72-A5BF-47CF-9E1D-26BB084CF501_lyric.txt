I can't explain but I wanna try
There's this image of you and I
And it goes dancing by in the morning and in the night time
There's all these secrets that I can't keep
Like in my heart there's that hotel suite
And you lived there so long, it's kinda strange now you're gone
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found

Has it gone for good?
Or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind?
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside
There's all those places we used to go
And I suspect you already know

But that place on memory lane you liked still looks the same, but something about
it's changed
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good?
Or is it coming back around?

Isn't it hard to make up your mind?
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside
And I thought I was yours forever
And maybe I was mistaken
But I just can't help manage to make it through the day without thinking of you lately

I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good?
Or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind?
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside
