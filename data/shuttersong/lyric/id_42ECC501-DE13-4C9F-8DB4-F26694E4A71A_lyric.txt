Extreme ways are back again
extreme places i didn't know
I broke everything new again
everything that i'd owned
I threw it out the windows, came along
extreme ways i know move apart
the colors of my sea
perfect color me

Extreme ways that that help me
help me out late at night
extreme places i had gone
but never seen any light
dirty basements, dirty noise
dirty places coming through
extreme worlds alone

did you ever like it planned

I would stand in line for this
there's always room in life for this
Oh baby, oh baby
then it fell apart, it fell apart
oh baby, oh baby
then it fell apart, it fell apart

oh baby, oh baby
then it fell apart, it fell apart
oh baby, oh baby
like it always does, always does
Extreme songs that told me
they helped me down every night
I didn't have much to say
I didn't get above the light

I closed my eyes and closed myself
and closed my world and never opened
up to anything
that could get me along
I had to close down everything
I had to close down my mind
too many things to cover me

too much can make me blind

I've seen so much in so many places
so many heartaches, so many faces
so many dirty things
you couldn't believe
I would stand in line for this
it's always good in life for this

Oh baby, oh baby
then it fell apart, it fell apart
oh baby, oh baby
then it fell apart, it fell apart
oh baby, oh baby
then it fell apart, it fell apart
oh baby, oh baby
like it always does, always does
