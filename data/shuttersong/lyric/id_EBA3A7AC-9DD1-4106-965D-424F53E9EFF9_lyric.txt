Got me ‘bout to break my neck
Tell me how you pop like that
You do it like it ain't no sweat
I never seen a bubble so fat
You do it all day in the mirror
You practise all day in the mirror
Left cheek, right cheek, all year
I'm calling you out, and I hope you hear it

Shawty right there got a ghetto booty
Shawty right there got a ghetto booty
Drop a dollar on the floor
Hope she give it to you
A ghetto booty
A ghetto booty
She got that trunk but she don't look back
She put it in reverse and I can't be mad
I can't be mad at that baby fat

That's a ghetto booty, a ghetto booty

She just wanna po po po po pop that bubblegum
she just wanna po po po po po pop that bubblegum
If she keep blinding, might explode

Never seen a girl like you before

She just wanna pop that bubblegum

Oh yeah

You do it like a professional
But you point your own schedule
Look you're so pretty in pain
Acting like a shit don't stain

You do it all day in the mirror
You practise all day in the mirror
Left cheek, right cheek, all year
I'm calling you out, and I hope you hear it

Shawty right there got a ghetto booty
Shawty right there got a ghetto booty
Drop a dollar on the floor
Hope she give it to you
A ghetto booty

A ghetto booty
She got that trunk but she don't look back
She put it in reverse and I can't be mad
I can't be mad at that baby fat
That's a ghetto booty, a ghetto booty

she just wanna po po po po po pop that bubblegum
she just wanna po po po po pop that bubblegum
If she keep blinding, might explode
Never seen a girl like you before
She just wanna pop that bubblegum

Blow it like a bubble
Bazooka, baby
Clouds on the couch
You my ah, baby
She got that senile
Make a grown man crazy
Got that senile
Make a grown man crazy
Shawty in the gym, ass-mazin
I pull up I get her, as(s) easy
It's too late to go back
She look back, I'm teasin
I'm kodak, my rolex, a moment, the history
Pussy bumb, tick-tock
Lip lock, thing pop, I'm done

T-raw, heart numb
No love, heart spun
Baby give me some yum yum
Big wheelie, surfboard
Wheelie on the jock, do your thang girl
And I need me a ride or Die and you'se a freak
I got seven different girls everyday of the week but

Shawty right there got a ghetto booty
Shawty right there got a ghetto booty

Drop a dollar on the floor
Hope she give it to you
A ghetto booty

I can't be mad at that baby fat
