I fought it for a long time now
While drowning in a river of denial
I washed up, fixed up, picked up all my broken things
'Cause you left me, police tape, chalk line
Tequila shots in the dark scene of the crime
Suburban living with a feeling that I'm giving up
Everything for you
Oh, oh, oh, how was I supposed to know
That you were oh, oh, over me
I think that I should go (GO!)
Something's telling me to leave but I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya, damned if I don't
It took a lot to take you home
One stupid call and I end up alone
You're made up, dressed up, messed up
Plans I set in stone
But you made me do when I don't like
Dancing in the alley with the street rat nightlife
Can't keep living with a feeling that I'm giving up everything for you
Oh, oh, oh, how was I supposed to know
That you were oh, oh, over me
I think that I should go (GO!)
Something's telling me to leave but I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya, damned if I don't
Make a fool of myself when you hang around
When you're gone
I'm a match that's burning out
Could have been, should've done, what I said I was going to do
But I never promised you
Oh, oh, oh, how was I supposed to know
That you were oh, oh, over me
I think that I should go (GO!)
It never took a fool to see the things that I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya, damned if I do ya
Oh, oh, oh, how was I supposed to know
That you were oh, oh, over me I think that I should go
Something's telling me to leave but I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya, damned if I d-d-d-d
Damned if I do ya, damned if I don't
