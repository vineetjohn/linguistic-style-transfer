What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Heeey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh what do you mean?
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Oh oh oh what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You're so indecisive of what I'm saying
Trying to catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy, or complaining
Don't want for us to end where do I start
First you wanna go to the left then you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, making love all night
First you up and you're down and then between
Ohh I really want to know...

What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Oh oh oh what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

When we're away we can't get enough
When we're together we only lose touch
I feel like I'm in heaven when I think of you girl
You tell me that you hate me and you know you are my world
All we do is fight from night to day
Telling me to leave then you want me to stay
I need you to be mine
Rising up and then we shine
Cause you're the one and I want you in my life
Cause I never wanna leave, I want you to be my wife
It's every time that I breathe
I have a vision of us together beautifully

What do you mean? Oooh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Heeey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh what do you mean?
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Oh oh oh what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
Oh oh oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Heeey
You don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh what do you mean?
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Oh oh oh what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
