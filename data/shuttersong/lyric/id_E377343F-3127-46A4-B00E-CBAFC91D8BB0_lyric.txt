Caribbean Blue
Roma Ryan
Eurus
Afer Ventus
So the world goes round and round
With all you ever knew
They say the sky high above
Is Caribbean blue
If every man says all he can
If every man is true
Do I believe the sky above
Is Caribbean blue
Boreas

If all you told was turned to gold
If all you dreamed were new
Imagine sky high above
In Caribbean blue
