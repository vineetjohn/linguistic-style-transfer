"I Wanna Love You"
(feat. Snoop Dogg)

[Akon:] Convict...Music...and you know we up front.

[Chorus: Akon]
I see you windin¡¯ and grindin¡¯ up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you, you already know
I wanna love you, you already know

[Snoop Dogg]
Money in the air as mo¡¯ fell
Grab you by your coattail, take you to the motel, ho sale
Don¡¯t tell, wont tell, baby say ¡°I don¡¯t talk, Dogg unless you told on me¡± - oh well
Take a picture wit me, what the flick gon¡¯ do
Baby stick to me and I¡¯ma stick on you
If you pick me then I¡¯ma pick on you
d-o-double g and I¡¯m here to put this dick on you
I'm stuck on pussy and your¡¯s is right
Rip ridin¡¯ the poles and them doors is tight
And I¡¯ma get me a shot ¡®fo the end of the night
Cause pussy is pussy and baby you¡¯re pussy for life

[Chorus: Akon]
I see you windin¡¯ and grindin¡¯ up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you, you already know
I wanna love you, you already know

[Akon]
Shorty I can see you ain¡¯t lonely
Handful of niggease and they all got cheese
See you lookin¡¯ at me now what its gon¡¯ be
Just another tease far as I can see
Tryna get you up out this club if it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwin¡¯ bout 30 stacks in the back make it rain like that cause I'm far from a scrub
And you know my pedigree, ex-deala use to move amphetamines
Girl I spend money like it don¡¯t mean nothing and besides I got a thing for you.

[Chorus: Akon]
I see you windin¡¯ and grindin¡¯ up on the floor,
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you, you already know
I wanna love you, you already know girl

[Snoop Dogg]
Mobbin' through the club and I¡¯m low pressin¡¯
I¡¯m sittin¡¯ in the back in the smoker¡¯s section (just smokin¡¯)
Birds eye, I got a clear view
You can¡¯t see me, but I can see you (baby I see you) -mm
It¡¯s cool, we jet, the mood is set, your pussy is wet
You¡¯re rubbin¡¯ your back and touchin¡¯ your neck
Your body is movin', you humpin' and jumpin'
Your titties is bouncin', you smilin' and grinnin' and lookin¡¯ at me

[Akon]
Girl and while your looking at me I¡¯m ready to hit the caddy
Right up on the patio move the patty to the caddy
Baby you got a phatty, the type I like to marry
Wantin¡¯ to just give you everything and that¡¯s kinda scary
Cause I'm loving the way you shake your ass
Bouncin', got me tippin' my glass
normally don¡¯t get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you

[Chorus: Akon]
I see you windin¡¯ and grindin¡¯ up on the floor,
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you, you already know
I wanna love you, you already know

[Chorus: Akon]
I see you windin¡¯ and grindin¡¯ up on the floor,
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you, you already know
I wanna love you, you already know

girl...
