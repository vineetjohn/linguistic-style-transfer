I caught you watching me under the light
Can I realign?
They say it's easy to leave you behind
I don't want to try

Cut cover, take that test
Hold courage to your chest
Don't wanna wait for you
Don't wanna have to lose
All that I compromised to feel another high
I've got to keep it down tonight

And oh oh oh, I was a king under your control
And oh oh oh, I want to feel like you've let me go
So let me go

Don't you remember how I used to like being on the line
I dreamed you dreamed of me, calling out my name
Is it worth the price?

Cut cover, take that test
Hold courage to your chest
Don't want to wait for you
Don't want to have to lose
All that I compromised to feel another high
I've got to keep it down tonight

And oh oh oh, I was a king under your control
And oh oh oh, I want to feel like you've let me go

I had to break myself to carry on
No longer, no admission
Take this from me tonight
Oh let's fight, oh let's fight
Oh let's fight, oh

And oh oh oh, I was a king under your control
And oh oh oh, I want to feel like you've let me go
So let me go

Let go, let go, let go of everything
Let go, let go, let go of everything
Let go, let go, let go of everything
Let go, let go, let go of everything
