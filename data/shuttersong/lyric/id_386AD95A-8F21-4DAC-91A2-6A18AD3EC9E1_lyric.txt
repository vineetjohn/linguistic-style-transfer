Stone cold
Stone cold
You see me standing
But I'm dying on the floor
Stone cold
Stone cold
Maybe if I don't cry
I won't feel anymore
Stone cold, baby
God knows I tried to feel
Happy for you

Know that I am
Even if I can't understand
I'll take the pain
Give me the truth
Me and my heart we'll make it through
If happy is her
I'm happy for you

Hmmm Hmm

Stone cold
Stone cold
You're dancing with her
While I'm staring at my phone
Stone cold
Stone cold
I was your amber
But now she's your shade of gold
Stone Cold, baby
God knows I tried to feel
Happy for you

Know that I am
Even if I can't understand
I'll take the pain
Give me the truth
Me and my heart will make it through
If happy is her
I'm happy for you

Don't wanna be stone cold, stone
I wish I could mean this but here's my goodbye

Oh, I'm happy for you
Know that I am
Even if I can't understand
If happy is her
If happy is her
I'm happy for you
