Fell from the sky
Fell from the sky and started walking
Leaving our foot prints on the ground

It might be a prayer
Or maybe a piece of conversation
Wherever we go we make a sound

So I call your name, the only thing I know
Is I need you here or you'll be gone forever

All that I know, all that I know
Is we're here tonight

Turn up the lights
Let go for tonight baby
Let love in your life and be strong (turn up the lights)
Let go for tonight baby
Who needs sleep tonight? 
I need to let go, let go
Let go, let go
Turn up the lights
Let love in your life baby
Who needs sleep tonight?

I wanna drive
I wanna drive into the open
Looking for reasons I can't find

So I call your name, the only thing I know
Is I need you here or you'll be gone forever

All that I know, all that I know is we're here tonight

Turn up the lights
Let go for tonight baby
Let love in your life and be strong (turn up the lights)
Let go for tonight baby
Who needs sleep tonight? 
I need to let go, let go
Let go, let go
Turn up the lights
Let love in your life baby
Who needs sleep tonight?

I need to let go, let go
Let go, let go
I need to let go, let go
Before we're gone, gone, gone

So I call your name, the only thing I know
Is I need you here or you'll be gone forever
All that I know, all that I know
Is I need you here or you'll be gone forever

Turn up the lights

Turn up the lights
Let go for tonight baby
Let love in your life and be strong (turn up the lights)
Let go for tonight baby
Who needs sleep tonight? 
I need to let go, let go
Let go, let go
Turn up the lights
Let love in your life baby
Who needs sleep tonight?

Let go, let go
Let go, let go
I need to let go, let go
Before we're gone, gone, gone

Fell from the sky
Fell from the sky and started walking
Leaving our foot prints on the ground
