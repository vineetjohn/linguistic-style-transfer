She sees them walking in a straight line
That's not really her style
And they all got the same heartbeat
But hers is falling behind
Nothing in this world
Could ever bring them down
Yeah they're invincible
And she's just in the background
And she says
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids
They seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
He sees them talking with a big smile
But they haven't got a clue
Yeah they're living the good life
Can't see what he is going through
They're driving fast cars
But they don't know
Where they're going
In the fast lane
Living life without knowing
And he says
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids
They seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
She sees them walking in a straight line
That's not really her style
And they all got the same heartbeat
But hers is falling behind
Nothing in this world could
Ever bring them down
Yeah they're invincible
And she's just in the background
Like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids
They seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
