He could be a sinner, or a gentleman
He could be your preacher, when your soul is damned
He could be your lawyer on a witness stand, but
He'll never love you like I can, can

He could be a stranger, you gave a second glance
He could be a trophy, of a one night stand
He could have your humour, but I don't understand 'cause
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

Why are you looking down on the wrong road
Mine is the heart, and the soul of this song
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can

A chance encounter of circumstance
maybe, he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced
He could be a science in this mayhem, but then again
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

Why are you looking down on the wrong road
Mine is the heart, and the soul of this song
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

He'll never love you like I can, can, can

We both have demons, that we can't stand
I love your demons, like devils can
If you're still seeking an honest man
Stop deceiving, Lord, please
Why are you looking down on the wrong road
Mine is the heart, and the soul of this song
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
