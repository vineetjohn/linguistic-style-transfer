Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today. Yeah

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long

Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands

From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights

Knock me down and back up again
You're in my blood
I'm not a lonely man

There's no load I can't hold
Road so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long
(all night long)
Gimme gimme gimme gimme yeah
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
(Oooo, yeah)
If you're going my way
(if you're going my way)
I wanna drive it all night long
(all night long)

There was a distance between you and I (between you & I)
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye
Ooooo Yeah!

There ain't no load that I can't hold
Road so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Tell 'em we're survivors
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
(all night long, yeah)
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long
Gimme gimme gimme gimme

Life is a highway (life is a highway)
