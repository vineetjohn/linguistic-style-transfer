I hear them calling for you
(Ooh)
I hear them calling for you

I feel the waves getting started
It's a rush inside I can't control
Your eyes keep pulling me in
I know, I know, I know

Your friends all talking 'bout me
They say I got no chance at all
Your fire is burning deep
In my soul, my soul, my soul

I ain't up for debating
Ain't enough for the taking
You got the world shaking

In the middle of the night
When the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart
Like a bullet in the dark

One by one
I gotta take them down
We can run and hide
Ain't goin' down without a fight

(Ooh)
I hear them calling for you
(Ooh)
I hear them calling

In the middle of the night
When the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart
They come straight for your heart

(Ooh)
I hear them calling for you
(Ooh)
I hear them calling for you

I keep on holding tight now
'Cause your body's telling me don't let go
We're gonna be starting up trouble
I know, I know, I know

It's bringing my demons out
More than ever down
Your beauty could start a war
As you walk in the door

I ain't up for debating
Ain't enough for the taking
We got the world shaking

In the middle of the night
When the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart
Like a bullet in the dark

One by one
I gotta take them down
We can run and hide
Ain't goin' down without a fight

(Ooh)
I hear them calling for you
(Ooh)
I hear them calling

In the middle of the night
When the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart
They come straight for your heart

(Ooh)
I hear them calling for you
(Ooh)
I hear them calling for you

I wish it wasn't true
But the whole world's tryna get a piece of you
And my heart keeps fighting in this battle of fools
Gotta make it through, gotta make it through

In the middle of the night
When the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart
Like a bullet in the dark

One by one
I tryna take them down
We can run and hide
Ain't goin' down without a fight

(Ooh)
I hear them calling for you
(Ooh)
I hear them calling

In the middle of the night
When the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart
They come straight for your heart

(Ooh)
I hear them calling for you
(Ooh)
I hear them calling for you
