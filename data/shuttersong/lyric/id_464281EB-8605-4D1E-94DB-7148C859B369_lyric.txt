
Do you feel better?

I grew up with a lot of green

Nice things round me
I was safe, I was fine
Grew up with a lot of dreams
Plans who to be
None of them, none were mine

I love freaks, I don't care if you're a wild one
I love freaks, I don't care if you're a wild one
And me...

I, I'm not the prettiest you've ever seen
But I have my moments, I have my moments
Not the flawless one I've never been
But I have my moments, I have my moments
I can get a little drunk, I get into all the dont's
But on good days I am charming as fuck
I can get a little drunk, I get into all the dont's

But on good days I am charming as fuck
I can be the perfect one, but I'll make you cum
And I'm locked in your mind
You can say I don't belong

That I'm so wrong
I can tell, tell you lie
I love freaks, I don't care if you're a wild one
I love freaks, I don't care if you're a wild one
And...
I, I'm not the prettiest you've ever seen
But I have my moments, I have my moments
Not the flawless one I've never been
But I have my moments, I have my moments
I can get a little drunk, I get into all the dont's
But on good days I am charming as fuck
I can get a little drunk, I get into all the dont's
But on good days I am charming as fuck
Rough around the edges, memories and baggage
You know me
Never play a safe card, when I go, I go hard
And now you know
I, I'm not the prettiest you've ever seen
But I have my moments, I have my moments
Not the flawless one I've never been
But I have my moments, I have my moments
I can get a little drunk, I get into all the dont's
But on good days I am charming as fuck
I can get a little drunk, I get into all the dont's
But on good days I am charming as fuck
