I'm fly like a pelican, hittin' your chick, you thinkin' she celibate
She know I'm the better man, you know I am too, you're feelin' irrelevant
Her body look so delicate, stomach is flat, her booty look pregnant
Her booty look pregnant, I hop on that ass like I'm ridin' an elephant
I think it soo evident, I skeet in your sheets, I'm leavin' the evidence
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, just look at the gelatin
When she walk like Nicki Minaj, beauty and elegance
Go hard for what I want never no settlin'
Pull up in the Porsche on you like skrut, I'm sick, I need medicine
I go crazy for the lady that I like though, American beauty and american psycho

I wish I dreamt in the shape of your mouth
But it's your thread count I really care about
Stay up 'til the lights go out
Stay up, stay up
You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
And as we're drifting off to sleep
All those dirty thoughts of me
They were never yours to keep, keep, whoa

Altar boys, altered boys
We¡¯re the things that love destroys
(I'm an American...I'm an American)
You, me, us, them
We¡¯re just resurrection men
(I'm an American...I'm an American)
Us, we were only meant, to make you live again
(I'm an American...I'm an American)
Us, we were pity sex, nothing more and nothing less
(I'm an American)
