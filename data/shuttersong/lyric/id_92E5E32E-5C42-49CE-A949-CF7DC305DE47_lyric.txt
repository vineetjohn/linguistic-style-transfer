These four lonely walls have changed the way I feel
The way I feel, I'm standing still
And nothing else matters now, you're not here
So where are you? This empty room is missing you

Where else can I go? Where else can I go?
Chasing you, chasing you
Memories turn to dust, please don't bury us
I got you, I got you

Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
Together we'll win it all
I ain't runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
We'll face it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all

I've outrun the fears that chased, they're standing still
I'm running still, I'm running still
And every voice that cries inside my head, forever drives
Forever drives, into lights

Where else can I go? Where else can I go?
Chasing you, chasing you

Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
Together we'll win it all
I ain't runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
We'll face it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all
If I, if I lose myself, I lose it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all
