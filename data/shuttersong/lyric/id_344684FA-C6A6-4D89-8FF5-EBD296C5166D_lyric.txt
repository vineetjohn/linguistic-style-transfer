There might have been things I missed
But don't be unkind
It don't mean I'm blind
Perhaps there's a thing or two

I think of lying in bed
I shouldn't have said
But there it is

You see it's all clear
You were meant to be here
From the beginning

Maybe I might have changed
And not been so cruel
Not been such a fool
Whatever was done is done
I just can't recall
It doesn't matter at all

You see it's all clear
You were meant to be here
From the beginning
