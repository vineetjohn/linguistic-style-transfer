And I know some things you don't
It comes and goes,
Like the strength in your bones whoa,
So keep your mind,
At a rest, i'll never let,
The two of us be friends,
Does it hurt?

Underdog,
Just look at the mess you've made,
It's such a shame, a shame,
We had to find out this way.

You must have, the must have,
Moment in your hands,
And its sad, take a bet,
This season, i'm gonna change,
Just not face to face,
It ain't broke,
So don't fix it.

Underdog,
Just look at the mess you've made,
It's such a shame, a shame,
We had to find out this way.

Revenge loves company,
Three makes it a crowd,
So watch your mouth,
Sit this one out.

And i'm down, down,
With everything else,
(With everything else)
Yeah, why did you call me again?
I bet, I bet we don't make it,
(I bet we don't make it)
Cause, I never say goodbye to my,
Friends in very high places,
They're only making bets with themselves, selves,
They're very, very selfish,
Well keep your mind in the air.

Underdog,
Just look at the mess you've made,
It's such a shame, a shame,
