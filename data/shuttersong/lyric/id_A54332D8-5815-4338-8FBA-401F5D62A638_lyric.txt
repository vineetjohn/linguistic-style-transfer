Go ahead, drop your guns
Draw a line and we'll cross so fun
Let's go
Yeah, one buy, one they fall
Taking out, buy alcohol
Poor souls

On a night like this I remember
How I miss my window
And I know this
We better live our lives up to the fullest
Till we're the only ones left standing

Wild hearts run, your time has just begun
Keep chasing for the sun, don't slow it down
Wild hearts run, we're all animals inside
Go brave into the night
Don't slow, slow, slow it down

Been down this road before
Hit the wall, kick down the door
Let's go
Mmm, Money, power, want a taste
I pray to God it don't go to waste
Don't know

On a night like this I remember
How I miss my window
And I know this
We better live our lives up to the fullest
Till we're the only ones left standing

Wild hearts run, your time has just begun
Keep chasing for the sun, don't slow it down
Wild hearts run, we're all animals inside
Go brave into the night
Don't slow, slow, slow it down

And I know this
We better live our lives up to the fullest
Till we're the only ones left standing

Wild hearts run, your time has just begun
Keep chasing for the sun, don't slow it down
Wild hearts run, we're all animals inside
Go brave into the night
Don't slow, slow, slow it down
(Wild hearts run, your time has just begun
Keep chasing for the sun, don't slow it down
Wild hearts run, we're all animals inside
Go brave into the night
Don't slow, slow, slow it down)
