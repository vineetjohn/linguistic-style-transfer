Your arms around me, come undone
Makes my heartbeat like a drum
See the panic in my eyes
Kiss me only when I cry
'Cause you always want what you're running from
And you know this is more than you can take

Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us
Baby please don't look away
When the morning breaks us
Oh, your touch so bittersweet
Aahhh, ah aaha
Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us

Your cheek is softly by the sun
Makes my heartbeat like a drum
I know it hurts you
I know it burns you
Hot and cold in a lonely hotel room
Look into me, tell me why you're crying
I need to know

'Cause you always want what you're running from
And it's always been that way
Oh

Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us
Baby please don't look away
When the morning breaks us
Oh, your touch so bittersweet
Aahhh, ah aaha
Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us

'Cause you always want what you're running from

Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us
Baby please don't look away
When the morning breaks us
Oh, your touch so bittersweet
Aahhh, ah aaha
Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us
