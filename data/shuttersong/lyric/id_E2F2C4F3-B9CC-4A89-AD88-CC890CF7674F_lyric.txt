Human - Christina Perri
I can hold my breath
I can bite my tongue
I can stay awake for days
If that's what you want
Be your number one
I can fake a smile
I can force a laugh
I can dance and play the part
If that's what you ask
Give you all I am
I can do it
I can do it
I can do it
But I'm only human
And I bleed when I fall down
I'm only human
And I crash and I break down
Your words in my head  knives in my heart
You build me up and then I fall apart
Cuz I'm only human
I can turn it on
Be a good machine
I can hold the weight of worlds
If that's what you need
Be your everything
I can do it
I can do it
I can do it
But I'm only human
And I bleed when I fall down
I'm only human
And I crash and I break down
Your words in my head  knives in my heart
You build me up and then I fall apart
Cuz I'm only human
I'm only human
I'm only human
Just a little human
I can take so much
Until I've had enough
?Cause I'm only human
And I bleed when I fall down
I'm only human
And I crash and I break down
Your words in my head  knives in my heart
You build me up and then I fall apart
?Cause I'm only human  yeah
