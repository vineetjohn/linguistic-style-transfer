Yeah
I wish
I was

free of this

I see her in my dreams
Wish that she wasn't there
But she still haunts me as I

Still feel her breath on me

Still want to taste her skin
But I know that would kill me

No!
Damn her, still I choke on her lies

Still Reeling from her last caress her goodbye

Oh how this sickens me
This wretched fools affair
I can't erase this from me

And now it permeates

And every thought I feel
The anger writhes in my soul

No!

Damn her, still I feel my stomach turn
Choke back hold my head high, I'm strong

No!
Damn her, still I choke on her lies
Not reeling I'm strong
Damn her, still I feel my stomach turn
Choke back hold my head high, I'm strong
No!
Damn her, still I choke on her lies
Not reeling I'm strong
yeah!
I wish
I was
free of this
