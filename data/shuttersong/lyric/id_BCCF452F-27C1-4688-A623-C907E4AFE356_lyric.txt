Well I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
I feel there's nothing I can do

yeah

I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
After all I knew it had to be something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end

If I go crazy then will you still call me superman
If I'm alive then well will you be there to hold my hand
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite

You call me strong, you call me weak but still your secrets I will keep
You took for granite all the times I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head, If not for me then you'd be dead
I'll get you up and put you back on solid ground
If I go crazy then will you still call me superman
If I'm alive then will you be there holding my hand
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite
oh whoa whoa
If I go crazy then will you still call me superman
If I'm alive then well will you be there holding my hand
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite
If I go crazy then will you still call me superman
If I'm alive then well will you be there holding my hand
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite
oh whoa whoa
oh whoa whoa
oh whoa whoa
