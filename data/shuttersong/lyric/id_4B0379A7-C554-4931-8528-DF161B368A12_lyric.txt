Thinkin' back, thinkin' of you
Summertime, think it was June
Yeah, think it was June

Laying back, head on the grass
Chewing gum, having some laughs
Yeah, having some laughs

You made me feel like the one
Made me feel like the one
The one

You made me feel like the one
Made me feel like the one
The one

Drinking back, drinking for two
Drinking with you
When drinking was new

Sleeping in the back of my car
We never went far
Didn't need to go far

You made me feel like the one
You made me feel like the one
The one

You made me feel like the one
You made me feel like the one
The one

I don't know where we are going now
I don't know where we are going now

Wake up call, coffee and juice
Rememberin' you
What happened to you?

I wonder if we we'll meet again
Talk about life since then
Talk about why did it end

You made me feel like the one
You made me feel like the one
The one

You made me feel like the one
You made me feel like the one
The one

I don't know where we are going now
I don't know where we are going now

So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now 
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now 
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now 
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now

So take a look at me now, now
