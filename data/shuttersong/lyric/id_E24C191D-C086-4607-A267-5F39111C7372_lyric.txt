We hit the elevator right up to the rooftop
The bass is pumping make me wanna screw the top off
Yeah, we'll be drinking and nobody's gonna stop us
And we'll be kissing anybody that's around us

I just wanna have fun tonight (blow up this shit tonight)
Put me under the flashing light
Ohhhhh, let me blow up this house tonight
(Gonna blow up!)

We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na nana na na na
We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Bitch, I'm Madonna
(Bitch bitch, I'm Madonna)
(Bitch bitch, I'm Madonna)

We're jumping in the pool and swimmin' with our clothes on
I poured a beer into my shoe and got my freak on
The neighbor's pissed and says he's gonna call the Five-O
If they show up then we are gonna give a good show

I just wanna go out tonight
Put me under the flashing light
Ohhhhh, let me blow up this house tonight
(Gonna blow up!)

(B-b-bitch move)

We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na nana na na na
We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Bitch, I'm Madonna
(Bitch, I'm Madonna)
(Bitch bitch, I'm Madonna)
(Bitch, I'm Madonna)

Who do you think you are?
You can't mess with this lucky star
Ohhhhh, who do you think you are?

Uh!
Poured up with my nose up
And that rosé up in that thinga
I'm froze up with my stove up
Cuz he eatin' like it's his dinner
I run shit, I don't fall back
Cuz I'm on track, I'm a sprinter
I'm bossed up, I got 'em awestruck
It's not a toss up, I'm the winner
Be-b-b-beep-beep, bitch, move
Before I bang-bang with that uzz
That's Miu Miu on my shoes
Ain't got a thing left for me to prove
It's that bottle service all night
It's that pop and urban just right
It's that \
