Where the boys are, someone waits for me
A smilin' face, a warm embrace, two arms to hold me tenderly

Where the boys are, my true love will be
He's walkin' down some street in town and I know he's lookin' there for me

In the crowd of a million people I'll find my valentine
And then I'll climb to the highest steeple and tell the world he's mine

Till he holds me I'll wait impatiently
Where the boys are, where the boys are
Where the boys are, someone waits for me
Till he holds me I'll wait impatiently
Where the boys are, where the boys are
Where the boys are, someone waits for me
