Born in this world
I say it's No Money No Love
No Money No Love
Yeah yeah yeah
In case you wanna hear it again
It's No Money No Love
No Money No Love
Yeah yeah yeah
It's sure you love me now as the world is in my fever
Watch me while I disappear
No Money No Love
(yeah yeah yeah)
I get my heart scarred
From all my sins
Was payback to never feel all again
Do you see the scars bruising my skin
Oh I wish I could erase them and start all over again
Maybe I should get down on my knees and I'll still be forgiven
For what I've done
Born in this world
I say it's No Money No Love
No Money No Love
Yeah yeah yeah
In case you wanna hear it again
It's No Money No Love
No Money No Love
Yeah yeah yeah
It's sure you love me now as the world is in my fever
Watch me while I disappear
No Money No Love
(yeah yeah yeah)
Vodoo I call when the world is closing in
Is it too late for me to be death
I give my last to be loved again
I cross my arms and clap for night
Can you say this dealer, have some mercy
Maybe I should get down on my knees and I'll still be forgiven
For what I've done
Born in this world
I say it's No Money No Love
No Money No Love
Yeah yeah yeah
In case you wanna hear it again
It's No Money No Love
No Money No Love
Yeah yeah yeah
It's sure you love me now as the world is in my fever
Watch me while I disappear
No Money No Love
