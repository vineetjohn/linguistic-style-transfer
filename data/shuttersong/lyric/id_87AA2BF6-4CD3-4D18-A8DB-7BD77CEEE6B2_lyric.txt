My secrets are burning a hole through my heart
And my bones catch a fever
When it cuts you this deep
It's hard to find a way to breathe

But your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper
Shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe

Time stood still
The way it did before I
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking

I'm at the edge of the world
Where do I go from here?
Do I disappear?
The edge of the world
Do I sink or swim?
Or simply disappear?

But your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper
Shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe

Time stood still

The way it did before I
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Wake up!

Take my hand
Give me a reason to start again
Wake up!
Take my hand
Give me a reason to start again
Cause your eyes are swallowing me

Mirrors start to whisper
Shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe
Time stood still
The way it did before I
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking
