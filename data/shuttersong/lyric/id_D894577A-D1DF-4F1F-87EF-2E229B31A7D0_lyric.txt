Well you ask me 'bout the clothes I wear
And you ask me why I grow my hair
And you ask me why I'm in a band
I dig doin' one night stands
And you wanna see me doin' my thing
All you gotta do is plug me into high
I said high

High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage, High voltage
High voltage rock 'n' roll

Well you ask me why I like to dance
And you ask me why I like to sing
And you ask me why I like to play
I got to get my kicks some way
And you ask me what I'm all about
Come on let me hear you shout high
I said high

High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage, High voltage
High voltage rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll

I said high, I get it high
Whaaaah!

High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage, High voltage
High voltage rock 'n' roll

Stars, falling on the ground
spotlights, footlights, turn me on
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage rock 'n' roll
Wine, women and song
High voltage, High voltage
Plug me in, turn me on, I'm a sparklin' man/
High voltage rock 'n' roll
