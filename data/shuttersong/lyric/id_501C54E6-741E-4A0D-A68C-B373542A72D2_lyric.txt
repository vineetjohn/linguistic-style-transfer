This song is dedicated
to all the lovers who cant be together
separated by distance and time

You were always on my mind
All I do is count the days

Where are you now?
Know I never let you down
I will never go away

I really wish that you would stay but what would we do
All the days that you've been gone I dream about you
And I anticipate the day that you will come home, home, home
No matter how far you are

No matter how long it takes him
Through distance and time
I'll be waiting

And if you have to walk a million miles
I'll wait a million days to see you smile
Distance and time, I'll be waiting
Distance and time, I'll be waiting
Will you take a train, to meet me where I am

Are you on your way?
And I will never do anything to hurt you
I'll never live without you

I really wish that you would stay but what would we do
All the days that you've been gone I dreamed about you
And I anticipate the day that you will come home, home, home
No matter how far you are
No matter how long it takes him
Distance and time, I'll be waiting
And if you have to walk a million miles

I'll wait a million days to see you smile
Distance and time
I'll be waiting
No matter how far you are
No matter how long it takes him
Through distance and time, I'll be waiting

And you can walk a million miles
I'll wait a million days to see you smile
Through distance and time, I'll be waiting

Oh oh oh, oh
Oh oh oh, hey
Oh oh oh oh
I'll be waiting
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Through distance and time
I'll be waiting
You are always on my mind
All I do is count the days
Where are you now?
