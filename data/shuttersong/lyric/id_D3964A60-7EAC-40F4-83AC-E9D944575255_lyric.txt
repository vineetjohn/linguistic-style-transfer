I been livi'n for the weekend
But, no, not anymore
Cuz here comes that familiar feelin'
That Fridays famous for

Yeah I'm lookin' for some action
And it's out there somewhere
You can feel the electricity
All in the evening air

And it may just be more of the same
But sometimes you wanna go where everyone knows your name
So I guess I'll have to wait and see
But I'm just gonna let something brand new happen to me

And it's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

It's alright
It's alright
Bright lights and the big city
It belongs to us tonight

Now Friday's cool
But there's somethin' about Saturday night
You can't say what you want to
Cuz you know that you just might

I'm alive this evening
It was love at first sight

This Saturday
And every Saturday for the rest of my life
And everyone's standin' in line
Yeah lookin' good and lookin for a real good time

So I'll never have to wonder if
I'll have someone to share all of this with
And it's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
Bright lights and the big city
It belongs to us tonight
Yes I need it
Everybody does
Cocktails and conversation
Music and making love
And it's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
Bright lights and the big city
It belongs to us tonight
Bright lights
Bright lights
Bright lights and the big city
It belongs to us tonight
Tonight
