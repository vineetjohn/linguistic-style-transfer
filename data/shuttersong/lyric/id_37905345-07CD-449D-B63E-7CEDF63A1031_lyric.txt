Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they¡¯re not shinin¡¯
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin¡¯
She¡¯s so beautiful
And I tell her everyday

Yeah...
I know, I know when I compliment her, she won¡¯t believe me
And it¡¯s so, it¡¯s so sad to think that she don¡¯t see what I see
But every time she asks me do I look okay?
I say

When I see your face
There¡¯s not a thing that I would change
¡®Cause you¡¯re amazing
Just the way you are

And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
¡®Cause girl, you¡¯re amazing
Just the way you are

Yeah
Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she¡¯d let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates but I think it¡¯s so sexy
She¡¯s so beautiful
And I tell her everyday

Oh, you know, you know, you know I¡¯d never ask you to change
If perfect¡¯s what you¡¯re searching for, then just stay the same
So don¡¯t even bother asking if you look okay
You know I¡¯ll say

When I see your face
There¡¯s not a thing that I would change
¡®Cause you¡¯re amazing
Just the way you are

And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
¡®Cause girl, you¡¯re amazing
Just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you¡¯re amazing
Just the way you are

When I see your face
There¡¯s not a thing that I would change
¡®Cause you¡¯re amazing
Just the way you are

And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
¡®Cause girl, you¡¯re amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah
