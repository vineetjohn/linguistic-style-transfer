American Girl - Bonnie McKee
I fell in love in a 7/11 parking lot
Sat on the curb drinking slurpees
We mixed with alcohol
We talked about all our dreams
And how we would show 'em all
(whoa oh oh oh)
I told him I got a plan
And I'm gonna dominate
And I don't need any man
To be getting in my way
But if you talk with your hands
Then we can negotiate (whoa oh oh oh)
I just keep moving my body (yeah)
I'm always ready to party (yeah)
No I don't listen to mommy (yeah)
And I'll never say that I'm sorry
Oh I'm an American girl
Hot blooded and I'm ready to go
I'm loving taking over the world
Hot blooded  all american girl (Whoa)
I was raised by a television
Every day is a competition
Put the key in my ignition (Oh-way-oh)
I wanna see all the stars
And everything in between
I wanna buy a new heart
Out of a vending machine
Cause It's a free country
So baby we can do anything (Whoa)
I just keep moving my body (yeah)
I'm always ready to party (yeah)
No I don't listen to mommy (yeah)
And I'll never say that I'm sorry
Oh I'm an American girl Hot blooded
And I'm ready to go I'm loving taking over the world
Hot blooded  all American girl (Whoa)
I was raised by a television
Every day is a competition
Put the key in my ignition (Oh-way-oh)
You know we're gonna shine so bright
(Oh we're gonna shine so bright   )
Oh baby gonna go all night (Oh we're gonna go all night)
You know we're gonna shine so bright
(Oh we're gonna shine so bright   )
Oh baby gonna go all night
Oh I'm an american girl
Hot blooded and I'm ready to go
I'm loving taking over the world
Hot blooded  all american girl (Whoa)
I was raised by a television
Every day is a competition
Put the key into my ignition (Oh-way-oh)
Oh I'm an american girl
Hot blooded and I'm ready to go
I'm loving taking over the world
I'm an American girl
