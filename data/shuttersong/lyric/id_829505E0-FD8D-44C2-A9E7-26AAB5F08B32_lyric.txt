Solo cup when brought to the public
Balmain's clean as a whistle, green ain't the issue
Lil bit of money make a difference, nothin' is somethin'
It's so hard to function with all of these hoes in the house
Fuck y'all assumption, my blood still rushin', my heart still thumpin'
Up like Trump, kickin' like Ike, got a bitch twerkin' on Skype
MGM every night, Sremm at the door, king of the swipe
Motherfuckers worry 'bout likes on they pictures
They ain't got a single dollar, or a nickel
They ain't even got a penny, for the strippers
And they wanna pop bottles, like winners
Check my pedigree I always been a money fiend
All these fuckin' rings, I'm shinin', like a fuckin' king
Breakin' down the kush, don't it look so plush?
Take a couple puffs, I'm like Donald Trump!
