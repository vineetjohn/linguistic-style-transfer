Well, she lives in a fairy tale
Somewhere too far for us to find
Forgotten the taste and smell
Of the world that she's left behind

It's all about the exposure
The lens I told her
The angles were all wrong now
She's ripping wings off of butterflies

Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds

Well, go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle

Para, pa, para, pa, para!

Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle

So one day he found her crying
Coiled up on the dirty ground
Her prince finally came to save her
And the rest you can figure out

But it was a trick and the clock struck twelve
Well, make sure to build your heart
Brick by boring brick
Or the wolf's gonna blow it down

Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds

Well, go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle

Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
And we'll bury the castle, bury the castle

Well, you built up a world of magic
Because your real life is tragic
Yeah, you built up a world of magic

If it's not real
You can't hold it in your hand
You can't feel it with your heart
And I won't believe it
But if it's true
You can see it with your eyes
Oh, even in the dark
And that's where I want to be, yeah
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle
