There was truth, there was consequence, against you
A weak defense, then there's me
I'm 17, and looking for a fight
All my life, I was never there just a ghost, running scared
Here our dreams aren't made, they're won

Lost in the city of angels
Down in the comfort of strangers, I
Found myself in the fire burnt hills
In the land of a billion lights

Bought my fate, straight from hell
A second sight has paid off well
For a mother, a brother and me
The silver of the lake at night
The hills of Hollywood on fire
A boulevard of hope and dreams
And streets made of desire

Lost in the city of angels
Down in the comfort of strangers, I
Found myself in the fire burnt hills
In the land of a billion lights

I found myself in the fire burnt hills
In the land of a billion lights
(Angels)
(Angels)

I am home, home, home, home

Lost in the city of angels
Down in the comfort of strangers, I
Found myself in the fire burnt hills
In the land of a billion lights

One life, one love, live
One life, one love, live
One life, one love, live
One life, one love
The city of angels
The city of angels
The city of angels
The city of angels
