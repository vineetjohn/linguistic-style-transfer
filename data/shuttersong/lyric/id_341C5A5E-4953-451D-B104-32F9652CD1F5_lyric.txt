God save our gracious Queen
Long live our noble Queen
God save the Queen:
Send her victorious
Happy and glorious
Long to reign over us

God save the Queen!
O Lord, Our God arise
Scatter her enemies
And make them fall!
Confound their politics
Frustrate their knavish tricks
On thee our hopes we fix:

God save us all.
Thy choicest gifts in store
On her be pleased to pour
Long may she reign
May she defend our laws
And ever give us cause
To sing with heart and voice
God save our Queen!
