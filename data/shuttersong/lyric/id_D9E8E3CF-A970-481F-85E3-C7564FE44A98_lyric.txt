Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Cast out to sea
Drifting with the tide
Aint no way of finding me
Now that I'm free
Nothing but blue skies
Paradise in front of me

Awake from this dream

I hold my breath and just believe
Tired of all the troubles
They've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight
Gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith
Now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning
Gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over
Get it right this time
Life gives you pennies
Turn them into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over

I'm in the middle of starting over

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Alone, in a room
Tearing down the walls
Painting over scars and bruises
Now this is home

Fill it up with love
And make the best of something new, yeah

As hard as it seems
I'll hold my breath and just believe

Tired of all the troubles
They've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight
Gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith
Now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning
Gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over
Get it right this time

Life gives you pennies
Turn them into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over

The colors and the stars

Seem a little brighter
Tomorrow isn't far away (not far away)
Through the hardest part
I'm working towards a happy ending

Tired of all the troubles
They've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight
Gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith
Now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning
Gonna hit rewind

Chance to do it over
Get it right this time
Life gives you pennies
Turn them into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over

Tired of all the troubles
They've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight
Gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith
Now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning
Gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over
Get it right this time
Life gives you pennies
Turn them into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over
I'm in the middle of starting over
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
