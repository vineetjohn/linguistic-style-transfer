God knows what is hiding in those weak and drunken hearts
I guess you kissed the girls and made them cry those
Hard faced Queens of misadventure

God knows what is hiding in those weak and sunken eyes
Fiery throngs of muted angels
Giving love and getting nothing back

People help the people
And if you're homesick
Give me your hand and I'll hold it
People help the people
Nothing will drag you down
Oh and if I had a brain
Oh and if I had a brain
I'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool
That turned, all those good hearts away

God knows what is hiding, in this world of little consequence
Behind the tears, inside the lies
A thousand slowly dying sunsets
God knows what is hiding in those weak and drunken hearts
I guess the loneliness came knocking
No one needs to be alone, oh save me

People help the people
And if you're homesick, give me your hand and I'll hold it
People help the people
Nothing will drag you down
Oh and if I had a brain,
Oh and if I had a brain,
I'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool
That turned, all those good hearts away
People help the people
And if you're homesick, give me your hand and I'll hold it
People help the people
Nothing will drag you down
Oh and if I had a brain, Oh and if I had a brain
I'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool
That turned, all those good hearts away
