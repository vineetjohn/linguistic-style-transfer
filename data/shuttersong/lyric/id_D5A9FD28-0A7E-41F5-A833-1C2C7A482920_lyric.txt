Seems like your heart stops working
The minute they close the curtain
And take off your mask
And take off your costume
And if anyone asks you're taking a smoke break
Drinking some coffee
But everyone knows what you're doing
Seems like the bus moves slower
Just cause you got somewhere to go
So you take a few pills in Beverly Hills
But if anyone asks you've got a prescription
You got an addiction
Who do you think that you're fooling

John Doe, I just want the John I know
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home
John Doe, ooh oh oh oooh
Oooh oh oh ohooh oooh
Oooh oh oh ohooh oooh

Errybody's addicted to something
Errybody gotta grip onto something
Even if it's just to feel the response of appeal
Maybe once, maybe twice
Maybe hundreds of times, hundreds of times
Without it, it's just harder to function at times
You race to the bottom of every single bottle
As if there was someone or something to find
You're struggling in your mind
And you tell yourself lie after lie
'Til you get to the point where it's no longer private
That people that you work with noticed the signs
When you walk in the room
It gets noticeably quiet
So you break up the silence, you say you've been at the gym
But the way look, can't blame on the diet
So what you hiding?

Yeah, I've probably had too many things
Smashed too many freaks
Had too much to dro...(I mean)
Had too much to drink
Left the club, ended up in custody
Random drug test, passed it luckily
My girl broke up wit' me cause she walked in suddenly
With a woman up under me
I told her "Wait!
It ain't what it look like!
I must've slip and fell, clumsy me!"
Well, at least I admit it, cause the worst you could do
Is to do it and not be man enough to say that you did it
That's just how you prevent it, well I ain't no different
I love all the money, the fame
And the parties with beautiful women
I spend so much time as an underground artist
Cause I was afraid to succumb to the business
And what I'd become
But that what you'd judge I become
The path with the greatest resistance
That's how the tables can turn when they pivot
And change you perspective and flip your entire position
My whole life I've been dying to wish and to live and experience
Everything possible
When I told 'em my dreams, they just said they ain't logical
Now, I can see it - it's optical (optical)

Ooh oh oh oooh
Oooh oh oh ohooh oooh
Oooh oh oh ohooh oooh
John Doe, I just want the John I know
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home
John Doe...
