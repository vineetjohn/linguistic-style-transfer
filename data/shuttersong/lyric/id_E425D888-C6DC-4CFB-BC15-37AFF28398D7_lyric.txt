Yeah you!
Yeah you!

I used to wanna be
Living like there's only me
And now I spend my time
Thinking 'bout a way to get you off my mind
(Yeah you!)
I used to be so tough
Never really gave enough
And then you caught my eye
Giving me the feeling of a lightning strike
(Yeah you!)

Look at me now, I'm falling
I can't even talk, st-stuttering
This cloud I'm on, it keeps shaking
Oh oh oh, now!

All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you

Everybody's trying to be a billionaire
But every time I look at you I just don't care
Cause all I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
(Yeah you!)

I used to run around
I didn't wanna settle down
But now I wake each day
Looking for a way that I can see your face
(Yeah you!)
I've got your photograph
But baby I need more than that
I need to know your lips
Nothing ever mattered to me more than this
(Yeah you!)

Look at me now, I'm falling
I can't even talk, st-stuttering
This cloud I'm on, it keeps shaking
Oh oh oh, now!

All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you

Everybody's trying to be a billionaire
But every time I look at you I just don't care
Cause all I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
(Yeah you!)

Look at me now, I'm falling
I can't even talk, st-stuttering
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah you!)

All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
(Yeah you!)

All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
(Yeah you!)

But every time I look at you I just don't care
Cause all I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
