 She got,  she got,  she got
 Her  own  reasons
For talking to me
 She don't,  she don't,  she don't
Give a fuck
About what I need
And I can't tell you why
Because my brain can't equate it
Tell me your lies
Because I just can't face it
It's you, it's you
It's you
It's you, it's you
It's you
I won't, I won't, I won't
Cover the scars
I'll let 'em bleed
So my silence
So my silence won't
Be mistaken for peace
Am I wrong for wanting us to make it?
Tell me your lies
Because I just can't face it
It's you, it's you
It's you
It's you, it's you
It's you
Could it be that it's a lesson
That I never had to learn?
I looked at it like a blessing
And now it's just a curse
I don't know why
I don't know why
It's you, it's you
It's you, it's you
It's you
