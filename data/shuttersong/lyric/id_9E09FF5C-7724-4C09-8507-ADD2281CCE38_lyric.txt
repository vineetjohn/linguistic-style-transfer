Every breaking wave on the shore
Tells the next one there'll be one more
And every gambler knows that to lose
Is what you're really there for
Summer I was fearless
Now I speak into an answer phone
Like every falling leaf on the breeze
Winter wouldn't leave it alone
Alone

If you go?
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so?
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing

Every breaking wave

...
Every sailor knows that the sea
Is a friend made enemy
And every shipwrecked soul, knows what it is
To live without intimacy
...

I thought I heard the captain's voice
It's hard to listen while you preach

Like every broken wave on the shore
...
This is as far as I could reach
...
If you go?
If you go your way and I go mine

Are we so?
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby every dog on the street

Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing

Every breaking wave?
...
The sea knows where are the rocks
And drowning is no sin

You know where my heart is
The same place that yours has been
We know that we fear to win
And so we end before we begin
Before we begin
...
If you go?
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so?
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
...
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave
