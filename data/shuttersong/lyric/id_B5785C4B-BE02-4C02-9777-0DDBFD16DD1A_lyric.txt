Unforgettable
That's what you are,
Unforgettable
Tho' near or far.

Like a song of love that clings to me,
How the thought of you does things to me.
Never before
Has someone been more

Unforgettable
In every way,
And forever more
That's how you'll stay

That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am
Unforgettable, too

Unforgettable
In every way
And forever more
That's how you'll stay.

That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too
