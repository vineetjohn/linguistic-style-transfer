Its the strangest feeling
Feeling this way for you
There's something in the way you move
Something in the way you move
With you I'm never healing
It's heartache through and through
There's something in the way you move
I don't know what it is you do
Not one bone in your body good enough for me
But this heart is open, bloodstain on my sleeve
When our eyes meet, I can only see the end
But tonight I'm here yours again

But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire
I was the first of all
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill is what you waiting for?

Something in the way you move
It's something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
Something in the way you move
It's something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

There's an evil nightmare
The stars don't shine tonight, no
It's something in the way you do
It's something in the way you
Push me closer, further
Bring me yours enough
Your lies always seem so true
There's nothing left for me to lose
There's not one thing I can do to change your ways
But I can't sit back and take the lonely days
When our eyes meet, I can only see the end
And tonight the rain yours again

But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire, I was the first of all
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill is what you waiting for?

Something in the way you move
It's something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
Something in the way you move
It's something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire, I was the first of all
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill it, what you waiting for?

Something in the way you move
It's something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
Something in the way you move
It's something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh

Something in the way you move
It's something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
Something in the way you move
It's something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
