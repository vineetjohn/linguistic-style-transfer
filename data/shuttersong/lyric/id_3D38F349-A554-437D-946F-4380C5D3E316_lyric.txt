You know what it is when you hear that, haaaaan?
Double OT
Post Malone
I'm a new breed
Montana! Montana, haaan

[Verse 1 - French Montana:]
I'm surfin', surfin', I'm surfin' on you
Wavy, I'm wavy, I'm wavy on you
Started from the block, yeah I was broke, I
Didn't give me no choice but slingin' that coca
Dealt with the hand I was dealt like poker
Came back with the 4, 5 like Michael Jordan, like Jordan
Started rappin', they was laughin'
Bought a spaceship, bought a mansion, with J-Lo in the Hamptons
Now I'm dancin', I bought me a crib with a lake
Purple drank like grape, bitch jump off like Blake
Diamonds lookin' like steak
They ain't gettin' real money, since I was so young
Montana!

[Hook - Post Malone:]
Saucin', saucin', I'm saucin' on you
I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin' oh ooh
I'm ballin', I'm ballin', Iverson on you
Watch out, watch out, watch out, yeah
That's my shot, that's my shot, that's my shot, yeah
Spendin', I'm spendin' all my fuckin' pay

[Verse 2 - Post Malone:]
Cigarettes and a headband
Commas, commas in my head, man
Slumped over like a dead man
Red and black, 'bout my bread, man
I'm the answer, never question
Lace up, learn a lesson
Bitch I'm saucin', I do this often, don't do no talkin'
My options right when I walk in, jump all them Jordans
I'm ballin', money jumpin'
Like I'm Davis from New Orleans
Or bitch I'm Harden, I don't miss nothin'
Fuck practice, this shit just happens, know y'all can't stand it
I have it, I'll never pass it, I work my magic
High average, ball on these bastards, it makes me happy
It's tragic, I make it happen, and all y'all Shaqtin'

[Pre-Hook - Post Malone:]
White Iverson
When I started ballin' I was young
You gon' think about me when I'm gone
I need that money like the ring I never won, I won

[Hook - Post Malone:]
Saucin', saucin', I'm saucin' on you
I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin' oh ooh
I'm ballin', I'm ballin', Iverson on you
Watch out, watch out, watch out, yeah
That's my shot, that's my shot, that's my shot, yeah
Spendin', I'm spendin' all my fuckin' pay

[Verse 3 - Slim Jxmmi:]
Yeah, Slim Jxmmi
I spend it as I get it, I'm ballin' with no limits
Fuck practice, I'm the illest livin'
Ain't no games or gimmicks, I'm defyin' physics
Flyin' through the air, saucin' with the hair, SKRRT SKRRT
Matte black Range, big diamond earrings
Keep a nigga on his game, I'm ballin' like AI
Somewhere in LA, high, secret Sunday, I
Blowin' all the bank
Young, Iverson
When I started ballin' I was young
I need that money like them rings I never won
I need that money for them rings I never won
SremmLife!
