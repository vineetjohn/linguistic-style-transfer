The way you move is like a fall on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me runnin'
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of
Drop everything now

Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain 'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes
baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around 'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
My mind forgets to remind me You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really
something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would...
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain

Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain 'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around 'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow? I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show.
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain 'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes baby, as the lights go down

Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around 'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
And the sparks fly...
Oh, baby, smile...
And the sparks fly...
