We were both headed different ways
Both in a rush, trying to get away
I ran into you-ou-ou

Like a crash of thunder
Out in the rain waiting for the bus
We started talking 'bout different stuff

And it's true-ue-ue
There's an eight world wonder
And from now on
You're not as lonely as you think you are

I'm trying to tell you
Anything you want boy
I can make it happen
We could fall in love and I could be your sweetie
Anytime of day boy
I'll be your distraction

We can make it happen
I could be your sweetie, sweetie
You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you

Anything you want boy
I can make it happen
We could fall in love and I could be your sweetie, sweetie
A dinner date and a glass of wine

We stayed up late and lost track of time
When I'm with you-ou-ou
I feel a different hunger
You held my hand and you didn't let go

I'm gonna kiss you now
I thought you should know
And it's true-ue-ue
There's an eighth world wonder
And from now on
You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you
Anything you want boy
I can make it happen
We could fall in love and I could be your sweetie

Anytime of day boy
I'll be your distraction
We can make it happen
I could be your sweetie, sweetie
You're not as lonely as you think you are

I'm trying to tell you
Anything you want boy
I can make it happen
We could fall in love and I could be your sweetie
Anything you want boy
Anything you need
Anything you want boy
Anything you need
Anything you want boy
I can make it happen

We could fall in love and I could be your sweetie
Anytime of day boy
I'll be your distraction
We can make it happen
I could be your sweetie, sweetie
You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you
Anything you want boy
I can make it happen
We could fall in love and I could be your sweetie
Anytime of day boy
I'll be your distraction
We can make it happen
I could be your sweetie, sweetie
You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you
That all I wanna do, is just be true to you
And give you satisfaction
Sweetie, sweetie
Yea
