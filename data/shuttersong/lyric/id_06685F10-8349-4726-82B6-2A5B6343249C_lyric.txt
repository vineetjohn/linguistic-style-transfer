I see you and me riding like Bonnie and Clyde
Goin ninety five burning down one twenty nine yeah
Looking for the law, while I push my luck
She's ridin shot gun like it ain't no thing
Turn the radio up so the girl can sing right
Pull into the party like, "Y'all wassup"

Tonight is bottoms up
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet, little country town
Get up
Drop a tailgate on ya truck
Find a keg and fill ya cup up
Kick it on back
Pretty little mama lookin at ya like that
Make ya wanna slide on in like, "Girl, what's up"
Yeah tonight is bottoms up
Get em up
Tonight is bottoms up
Get em up
Damn

Girl I gotta tip my hat
Never thought a country song would make you move like that, yeah
And she's doing it in daisy dukes
Girl she's got ya tappin on a boys shoulder
Hey dog check this out
Man, it's how them girls do it in the dirty south, yeah
She'll have you on your knee, "Can I marry you?"

Yeah tonight is bottoms up
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet, little country town
Get up
Drop a tailgate on ya truck
Find a keg and fill ya cup up
