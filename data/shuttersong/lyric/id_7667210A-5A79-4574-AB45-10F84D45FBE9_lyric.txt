I'm slippin' down a chain reaction
And here I go here I go here I go go
And once again I'm yours in fractions
It takes me down pulls me down pulls me down low
Honey it's raining tonight
But storms always have an eye have an eye
Tell me you're covered tonight
Or tell me lies tell me lies lies
I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light
I want you to know that I'm all yours
You and me we're the same force
I want you to know that it's our time
I'm better under your reflection
But did you know did you know did you know know
That's anybody else that's met ya
It's all the same all the same all the same glow
Honey it's raining tonight
But storms always have an eye have an eye eye
Tell me you're covered tonight
Or tell me lies tell me lies lies
I want you to know that it's our time
I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light
I want you to know that I'm all yours
You and me we're the same force
I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light
I want you to know that I'm all yours
You and me run the same course
