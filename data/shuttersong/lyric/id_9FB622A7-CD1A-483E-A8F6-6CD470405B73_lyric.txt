Robert's got a quick hand.
He'll look around the room he won't tell you his plan.
He's got a rolled cigarette hanging out his mouth he's a cowboy kid.
Yeah he found a six shooter gun.
In his dads closet hidden in a box of fun things and I don't even know what.
But he's coming for you yeah he's coming for you.

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you'd better run better run outrun my gun.
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you'd better run better run faster than my bullet.

Daddy works a long day.
He be coming home late yeah he's coming home late.
And he's bringing me a surprise.
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice.
I've waited for a long time.
Yeah the slight of my hand is now a quick pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
And say your hair's on fire you must have lost your wits yeah.

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you'd better run better run outrun my gun.
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you'd better run better run faster than my bullet.
