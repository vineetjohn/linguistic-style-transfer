 You know my river won't evaporate
This world we still appreciate
 You could be  my luck
Even in a hurricane of frowns
I  know that we 'll be safe and sound
I could show  you love
In a tidal wave of mystery
 You 'll still be standing next to me
 You could be  my luck
Even if we're six feet underground
I  know that we 'll be safe and sound
I could lift  you up
I could show  you what  you want to see
and take  you where  you want to be
 You could be  my luck
Even if the sky is falling down
I  know that we 'll be safe and sound
I could lift  you up
I could show  you what  you want to see
and take  you where  you want to be
 You could be  my luck
Even if the sky is falling down
I  know that we 'll be safe and sound
