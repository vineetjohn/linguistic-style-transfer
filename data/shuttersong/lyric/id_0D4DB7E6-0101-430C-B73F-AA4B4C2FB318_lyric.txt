I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)

Then you come around again and say, "Baby
I miss you, and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you" We break up, you call me, "I love you"

Ooh, we called it off again last night, but ooh
This time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

Like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights and me
Falling for it screaming that I'm right and you
Would hide away and find your peace of mind with some
Indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight, but ooh
This time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say, "Never say never"
¡°

Uh, so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you"
I'm like, "I just, I mean this is exhausting
You know, like we are never getting back together"
"Like, ever" (No!)

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

We ¨C getting back together
We ¨C getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
