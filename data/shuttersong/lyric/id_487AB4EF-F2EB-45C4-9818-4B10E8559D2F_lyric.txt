Declare this an emergency
Come on and spread a sense of urgency
And pull us through
And pull us through
And this is the end
This is the end

Of the world
And it's time we saw a miracle
Come on, it's time for something biblical
To pull us through
And pull us through

And this is the end

This is the end
Of the world
Proclaim eternal victory
Come on and change the course of history
And pull us through
And pull us through
And this is the end
This is the end
Of the world
