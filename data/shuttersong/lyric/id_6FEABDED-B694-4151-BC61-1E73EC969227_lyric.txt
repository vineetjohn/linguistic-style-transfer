Sitting here all alone watching the snow fall
Looking back at the days when we threw them snowballs
I can't believe I'm putting the tree up by myself
I need you and nobody else
I'm sorry if I pushed you away
'Cause I need you here and I want for you to know

And I don't care if I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you this Christmas
This Christmas This Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas
This Christmas This Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas
And I never wanna do this alone
Baby I just need you to be here

Here through the holidays, yeah
I just wanna know if you feel the same way
Because I'm lonely baby, want you to hold me baby
And I'm sorry if I pushed you away
I just want you to know I miss you

And I want you to stay
And I don't care if I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now

And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you this Christmas
This Christmas This Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas
This Christmas This Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas
Wrapping gifts without you baby
Is like mid December and there's no cold
I can't do this on my own (oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
I've changed my ways

We keep running back and forth again
I'm here to stay
And I don't care if I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you this Christmas

This Christmas
This Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas
This Christmas
This Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas
