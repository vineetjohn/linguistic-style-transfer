 I've been walking
 In  the  same  way as  I did
Missing out
 The cracks  in  the pavement
And tutting my heel
And strutting my feet
Is there anything
 I can do for you dear?
Is there anyone  I could call?
No and thank you, please Madam
 I ain't lost, just wandering
Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh,  the people  I 've met
Are  the wonders of my world
Are  the wonders of my world
Are  the wonders of this world
Are  the wonders of my world
 I like it  in  the city
When  the air
Is so thick and opaque
 I love to see everybody
 In short skirts
Shorts and shades
 I like it  in  the city
When two worlds collide
You get  the people
And  the government
Everybody taking
Different sides
Shows that
We ain't gonna stand shit
Shows
That we are united
Shows
That we ain't gonna take it
Shows
That we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh  the people  I 've met
Are  the wonders of my world
Are  the wonders of my world
Are  the wonders of this world
Are  the wonders of my world~~
