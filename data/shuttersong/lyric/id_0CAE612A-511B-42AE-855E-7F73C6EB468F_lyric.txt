I was a liar, I gave into the fire
I know I should've fought it at least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure, cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better cause you don't want a liar

And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything, but boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything, but I got nothing here without you

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute, I'll swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me? At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault, I should have been more careful

And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything, but boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything, but I got nothing here without you

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
