It's been the longest winter without you

I didn't know where to turn to

See somehow I can't forget you
After all that we've been through
Go in come in thought I heard a knock
Who's there no one

Thinking that I deserve it
Now I realize that I really didn't know
you didn't notice you mean everything
Quickly I'm learning to love again
All I know is Imma be OK
Thought I couldn't live without you

It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to

It'll all get better in time
I couldn't turn on the TV
Without something there to remind me
Was it all that easy
To just put aside your feelings
If I'm dreaming don't wanna laugh

Hurt my feelings but that's the path
I believe in
And I know that time will heal it
If you didn't notice boy you meant everything

Quickly I'm learning to love again
All I know is I'm gonna be OK
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too

It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

Since there's no more you and me
It's time I let you go
So I can be free
And live my life how it should be
No matter how hard it is I'll be fine without you
Yes I will

Thought I couldn't live without you

It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time
