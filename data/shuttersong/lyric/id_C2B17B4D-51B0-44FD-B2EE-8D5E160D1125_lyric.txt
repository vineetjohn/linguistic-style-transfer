Got this flight to London
I ain't pop no Xans for it
 I'm tryna keep my head strong, but  my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're driftin' off, driftin' off?
 I know you think that it's  my fault for fallin' off
All this hope and disregard, driftin' off
 I know you think there ain't no fault,  I fall apart
And now  I 'm missin' your love
 I blame it on the distance
Why  I 'm fuckin' with these bitches
These numbers in  my phone
A text pops up, she's like, "Who is this?"
You probably got a mistress
Probably every week it switches
Now is this cause for concern?
And should  I be suspicious?
 I 'm overseas trippin', a million miles away
And she's still in L.A.,  my mom's out in the Bay
And these overseas minutes add up, that's a lot to pay
 I can pay it, yeah  I know, but it's the excuse  I say
She's been  tryna track me down
 I feel like  I 'm cattin' now
Dodgin' her when she's the one
 I 'm out here trippin', actin' wild
Start to wonder if  I've changed
 I 'm like how could that be now?
Would these bitches be here really
If  I wasn't rappin' now? Now tell me now
 I 'm faded once again,  I don¡¯t know where  I  am
But  I just know  I 'm driftin' far from you
 I 'm  tryna  keep  my  head  strong, but  my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're driftin' off, driftin' off?
 I know you think that it's  my fault for fallin' off
All this hope and disregard, driftin' off
 I know you think there ain't no fault, that fall apart
And now  I 'm missin' your love
 I 'm just so conflicted
It's been so long since we've kicked it
And  I can't lie,  I've missed it
But somewhere the current shifted
And now  I 'm somewhere else
Far away, feel like we drifted
Hard to face the facts
 I 'm drinkin' to escape 'em, then get lifted
Get swept under a rug, 'till  I 'm trippin' on a pile
Get a change, somethin' different for a while
Yeah we grew apart with time
We ain't kicked it in a while
But  I still think about you now
Without you, see there's differences now
But shit happens, how could we have known?
Nothin' can prepare us
From sleepin' at your parents, now to sold out shows in Paris
To parties at  my hotel ashin' blunts up off  my terrace
Tell me, how'd we ever come to live this careless?Tell me now
 I 'm faded once again,  I don¡¯t know where  I  am
But  I just know  I 'm driftin' far from you
 I 'm  tryna  keep  my  head  strong, but  my heart won't
Just let me grow away from you
