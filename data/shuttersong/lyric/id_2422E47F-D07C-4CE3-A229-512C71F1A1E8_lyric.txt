Sunday morning, rain is falling

Steal some covers, share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy
Living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you
That may be all I need

In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
Fingers trace your every outline

Paint a picture with my hands
And back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather still together when it ends
That may be all I need

In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
Yeah

Oh yeah

But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing someday it'll bring me back to you, yeah
Find a way to bring myself back home to you
You may not know

That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning, driving slow
oh yeah yeah oh yeah yeah oh yeah yeah
I'm a flower in your hair
yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Get back here
Get back here
Yeah
