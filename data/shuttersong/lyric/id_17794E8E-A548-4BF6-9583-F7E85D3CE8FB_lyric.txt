There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbeque
Is this a hickey or a bruise?

Pictures of last night

Ended up online

I'm screwed
Oh well...
It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure
It ruled
Damn
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar

So we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night

We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark

Then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna sto-op

Whoa!
But this Friday night

Do it all again
This Friday night

Do it all again
Trying to connect the dots

Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail
