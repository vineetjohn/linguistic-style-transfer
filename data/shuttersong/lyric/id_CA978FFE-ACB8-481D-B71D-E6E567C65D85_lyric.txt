I got the need for speedin' on a hot night.
Pushing 150 just to get a rise.
There's no comfort in comfort I need the edge.
But the edge keeps drifting it's all in my head.
Ooh remember back in Hollywood.
The medication flowing through my veins was you.
Yeah the summer back in Hollywood.
The medication, medication.

Just let me feel the rush like the first night.
Wanna breathe it out cause I'm going out my mind.
Gotta feel the touch like the first time.
Cause I'm chasing the original high.
Chasing the original high.
Chasing the original high.
Chasing the original high.
Chasing the original high

I'm tryin to buy a fix but there ain't no price.
I try to feed the hunger that keeps me up at night.
We were on a trip tryna replicate.
But the highs I hit just ain't doin it for me.
Ooh remember back in Hollywood.
The medication flowing through my veins was you.
Yeah the summer back in Hollywood.
The medication, medication.

Just let me feel the rush like the first night.
Wanna breathe it out cause I'm going out my mind.
Gotta feel the touch like the first time.
Cause I'm chasing the original high.
Chasing the original high.
Chasing the original high.
Chasing the original high.

Oooh summertime it stays on my mind cause you and me are alive inside.
Summertime is stuck on my mind.
Summertime it stays on my mind cause you and me never die inside.
Summertime is stuck on my mind.
Chasing the original high... high... high... high... high.
So high yeah.

Just let me feel the rush like the first night.
Wanna breathe it out cause I'm going out my mind.
Gotta feel the touch like the first time.
Cause I'm chasing the original high.
Chasing the original high.
Chasing the original high.
Chasing the original high.
Chasing the original high.
