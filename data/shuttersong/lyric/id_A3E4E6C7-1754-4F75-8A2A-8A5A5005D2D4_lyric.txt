And it's all alright.
I guess it's all alright.
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright.
Yeah, it's all alright.
I guess it's all alright.
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright.

And I got the call soon as the day hit night.
As soon as the headlights lit up the Westside.
I stopped the car and came outside
Cause I know that tone.
I remember the first time
We wished upon parallel lines.
Waiting for a friend to call
And say they're still alive.
I've given everyone I know
A good reason to go.
I was surprised you stuck around

Long enough to figure out

That it's all alright.
I guess it's all alright.
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright.
Yeah, it's all alright.
I guess it's all alright.

I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright.

And now all my loves that come back to haunt me.
My regrets and texts sent to taunt me.
I never claimed to be more than a one-night stand
I've given everyone I know

A good reason to go.
But I came back with the belief
That everyone I love is gonna leave me.

And it's all alright.
I guess it's all alright.
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright.

And it's all alright.
I guess it's all alright.
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all all

And I know, ohh nooo
You've fallen from the sun.
Crashing through the clouds.

I see you burning out.
And I know, ohh nooo
That I put up a front
But maybe, just this once
Let me keep this one.

And it's all alright.
I guess it's all alright.
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright.
And it's all alright.
I guess it's all alright.
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright.
Yeah, it's all alright.
I guess it's all alright.
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright.
And it's all alright
I guess it's all alright.
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright...
