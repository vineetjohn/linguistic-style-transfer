
It's the most wonderful time of the year

It's the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings
And gay happy meetings
When friends come to call
It's the hap-happiest season of all

There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago

It's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be much mistletoe-ing
And hearts will be glowing
When loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful time of the year

There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago

It's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be much mistltoe-ing
And hearts will be glowing
When loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful time
It's the most wonderful time
Oh, the most wonderful time of the year
