I feel like Superman, they gon' remember me
I think I know I can, who says it's hard to reach?
Who's gonna stop me on the road to success?
I don't know
They tried to break me down, but I'm still on my feet
This city's full of life, so why is it hard to breathe?
Oh, why did God create this world so unfair?
I don't know
Sometimes I feel like I can't run, I can't crawl
And sometimes I feel like I ain't nothing at all
Life is a journey where you stumble and fall
But I'm okay when I lie down in your arms
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
When I lie down in your arms
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
When I lie down in your arms
I feel like moving back, sometimes it's hard to dream
The life I chose is past, it's moving without me
Who doesn't want a machine so they can go back in time?
I don't know
My time went by too fast, there is no one left but me
I have got a nine to five and it gets the best of me
This is the life I'm gonna live to the end, but I'm okay
When I lie down in your arms
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
When I lie down in your arms
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
When I lie down in your arms
Sometimes I feel like I can't run, I can't crawl
And sometimes I feel like I ain't nothing at all
Life is a journey where you stumble and fall
But I'm okay when I lie down in your arms
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
When I lie down in your arms
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
When I lie down in your arms
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
When I lie down in your arms
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
When I lie down in your arms
