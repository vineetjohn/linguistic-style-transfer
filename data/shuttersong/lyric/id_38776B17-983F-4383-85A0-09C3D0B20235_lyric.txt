
Thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hyped feet
It feels good when you know you're down
A superdope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch
I told you homeboy, you can't touch this

Yeah, that's how we livin' and ya know
You can't touch this
Look in my eyes man, you can't touch this
Yo let me bust the funky lyrics, you can't touch this
Fresh new kicks and pants

You got it like that now you know wanna dance
So move out of your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rollin'. Hold on
Pump a little bit and let them know it's going on
Like that, like that
Cold on a mission so fall on back
Let 'em know that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, they can't touch
Yo I told you, you can't touch this

Why you standing there man, you can't touch this
Yo sound the bell school is in, sucker
You can't touch this
Give me a song or rhythm

Making no sweat that's what I'm giving 'em
So now they know
You talk about the Hammer when you're talking 'bout a show
That's hyped and tight
Singers are sweatin' so pass them a wipe
Or a tape to learn
What it's gonna take in the 90's to burn
The charts legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit
That's word because you know

You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Break it down!
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Stop! Hammer time!
Go with the flow. It is said

If you can't groove to this then you probably are dead
So wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves run your fingers through your hair
This is it for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Now move slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump
Bump bump bump

Yeah, you can't touch this
Look man, you can't touch this
You'll probably get hyped boy 'cause you know you can't, you can't touch this
Ring the bell school's back in, break it down!
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Stop! Hammer time!
You can't touch this

You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Break it down!
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Stop! Hammer time!
Every time you see me

That Hammer's just so hype
I'm dope on the floor
And I'm magic on the mic
Now why would I ever
Stop doing this?
With others makin' records
That just don't hit
I toured around the world
From London to The Bay
It's \
