Get Over Me - Nick Carter/Avril Lavigne
I messed up took you home
Just my luck you're a psycho
Now I'm locking up my door
You had my mail stole my phone
And how the hell did you change my passcode
I can't take this anymore can't take this anymore
First time it was amazing
Two times you acting crazy
Three times you say it's my baby it's my baby
You're calling me every night
Talking 'bout you and I
I'm hanging up this is my last goodbye
So how can I make you see
That there ain't no you and me
What can I do to get you out of my life
Get over me
Now I got a stage five clinger
Tryna put a ring on my finger
Only want me cause I'm a singer
Get over me
Now I got a stage five clinger
Tryna put a ring on my finger
Only want me cause I'm a singer
Get over me
You broke in stole my key
Got one made so you can watch me
Even when I am asleep
You creep
But that's not where the story ends
You follow me like every weekend
And you're freaking out my friends freaking out my friends
First time it was amazing
Two times you acting crazy
Three times you want my baby want my baby
You're calling me every night
Talking 'bout you and I
I'm hanging up this is my last goodbye
So how can I make you see
That there ain't no you and me
What can I do to get you out of my life
Get over me
Now I got a stage five clinger
Tryna put a ring on my finger
Only want me cause I'm a singer
Get over me
Now I got a stage five clinger
Tryna put a ring on my finger
Only want me cause I'm a singer
Get over me
Why can't you get the message
Move on and just forget
Some things were never meant to be
Oh woah
Why can't you get the message
Move on and just forget
Some things were never meant to be
Get over me
Get over me
Some things were never meant to be
You're calling me every night
Talking 'bout you and I
I'm hanging up this is my last goodbye
So how can I make you see
That there ain't no you and me
What can I do to get you out of my life
Get over me
Now I got a stage five clinger
Tryna put a ring on my finger
Only want me cause I'm a singer
Get over me
Now I got a stage five clinger
Tryna put a ring on my finger
Only want me cause I'm a singer
Get over me
