We always dreamed about this better life, this better life
We always felt it coming all along, yeah, all along
We got the keys to open paradise, yeah, paradise
Now let's go walking hand in hand

Come on baby we can hit the lights
Make the wrongs turn right
We can smash the club, make the pop go rock
With a love this deep, we don't need no sleep
And it feels like we could do this all night
We could do this all night
Yeah, everything is alright

We got the keys to open paradise, yeah, paradise
It feels like...
We could do this all night

[Beat break]

(we could do this all night)

Our winter melts under the summer skies, the summer skies
The seasons change, our hearts will stay the same, yeah, stay the same
We got that burning feeling, start a fire, start a fire
Giving a shout, let's make it hot

Come on baby we can hit the lights
Make the wrongs turn right
We can smash the club, make the pop go rock
With a love this deep, we don't need no sleep
And it feels like we could do this all night
We could do this all night
Yeah, everything is alright

We got the keys to open paradise, yeah, paradise
It feels like...we could do this all night

Feels like...
We could do this all night
All night, all night, all night, all night

Come on baby we can hit the lights
Make the wrongs turn right
We can smash the club, make the pop go rock
With a love this deep, we don't need no sleep
And it feels like...
We could do this all night
We could do this all night
We could do this all night
We could do this all night
Yeah, everything is alright

We got the keys to open paradise, yeah, paradise
It feels like...
We could do this all night
