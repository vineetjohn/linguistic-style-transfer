Center of attention once again
They don't understand
They don't understand no
Steadily tryna to tell me who I am
They don't understand
They don't understand no

You want a perfect picture to believe in
Then you can't be looking for me then

I don't need to live by your rules, you don't control me
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes, you don't know me
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told
(I see you thinking but there's just one thing clear
You think you know but you don't have no idea
Think you know me but there's more to see my love)

same arguments time and time again
And you watched them all happen
But they don't understand
Thinkin' you're the reason that it ends
And he won't be back again
But they don't understand, no

You want a perfect picture to believe in
Then you can't be looking for me then

I don't need to live by your rules, you don't control me
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes, you don't know me
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told
You don't know me

The girl you see in photographs is only
A part of the one I am, don't judge me
'Cause that's not reality and all I can be
Is in love with who I'm becoming

(Think you know me but there's more to see my love
you think you know but you don't have no idea)

I don't need to live by your rules, you don't control me
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes, you don't know me
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told
You don't know me
I don't need to live by your rules, you don't control me
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes, you don't know me
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told
(I see you thinking but there's just one thing clear
you think you know but you don't have no idea
Think you know me but there's more to see my love)
(My love)
