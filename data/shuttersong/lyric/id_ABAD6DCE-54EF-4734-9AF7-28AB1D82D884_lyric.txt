I woke up in a stranger's bed
with pins and needles in my head
and the clock ticking off the wall
Oh yeah Oh yeah

I don't even know myself
I wish I could be someone else
but I dont have a clue at all
Oh yeah

I'm sinking
You're wading
I'm thinking something's gotta give

Wake me up
Say enough is enough
I'm dying to live
Something's gotta give
Pull me out of this sinking town
I'm dying to live
Something's gotta give

Maybe I'm a fucking waste
filling up the empty space
I've been here way too long
Oh yeah Oh yeah

Feeling like a nervous wreck
living on my last paycheck
I'm a cliche in a song
and everybody's singing along

I'm sinking
You're wading
I'm thinking something's gotta give

Wake me up
Say enough is enough
I'm dying to live
Something's gotta give
Pull me out of this sinking town
I'm dying to live
Something's gotta give

Someone please come pull me out
from the shadow of my doubt
Wake me up
I'm falling

Wake me up
Say enough is enough
I'm dying to live
Something's gotta give
Pull me out of this sinking town
I'm dying to live
Something's gotta give
I'm sinking
You're wading
I'm thinking something's gotta give
Pull me out of this sinking town
I'm dying to live
Something's gotta give
