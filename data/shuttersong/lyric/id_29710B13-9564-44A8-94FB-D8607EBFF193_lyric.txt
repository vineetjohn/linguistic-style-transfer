3 pm on my feet and staggering
Through misplaced words and a sinking feeling
I got carried away
Sick, Sick of sleeping on the floor
Another night another score
I'm jaded, bottles breaking

You're only happy when I'm wasted
I point my finger but I just can't place it
Feels like I'm falling in love
When I'm falling to the bathroom floor
I remember how you tasted
I've had you so many times- lets face it
Feels like I'm falling in love alone
Stella would you take me home?
Stella would you take me home?

2 am I'm on a blackout binge again
You know I don't need sleep
And I lost my keys,
But I've got so many friends
And they keep, keep me coming back for more
Another night another score
I'm faded, bottles breaking

You're only happy when I'm wasted
I point my finger but I just can't place it
Feels like I'm falling in love
When I'm falling to the bathroom floor
I remember how you tasted
I've had you so many times- lets face it
Feels like I'm falling in love alone
Stella would you take me home?

One more reason I should never have met you
Just another reason I could never forget you
Down we go, the rooms spinning outta control
Lose yourself in a chemical moment
The night life's taking it's toll
That's just the way it goes
Come on, Stella would you take me home?

You're only happy when I'm wasted
I point my finger but I just can't place it
Feels like I'm falling in love alone
Stella would you take me home?

You're only happy when I'm wasted
I point my finger but I just can't place it
Feels like I'm falling in love
When I'm falling to the bathroom floor
I remember how you tasted
I've had you so many times- lets face it
Feels like I'm falling in love alone
Stella would you take me home?
