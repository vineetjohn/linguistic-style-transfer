It's not that easy with you here
But I know I want you to stay
See, this could be us in a few years
But just admit you like to play

It's like everyday
I'm kicking rocks
I could fly away
But you got me at a complete stop

How do you
Manage to keep me going
Bt somehow you keep me from going?

See, you distract me
But I'm distracted without you
I don't know how to focus, baby, teach me how to
'Cause I'm standing still again
But if you love me just like the way that I love you

I wouldn't mind a little comforting from you
Why do I let you in my head?
And I gotta go sometimes, but you're always on my mind
You're not helping me
You're not helping me
You're not helping me
You're not helping me

You're not helping me
But I helplessly fall for you

Now I'm running late
And I'm not a coffee drinker
But I lost sleep just thinking of you
So pour me a cup

I need to wake up
I need me some love
Now give it to me
'Cause everywhere you go, I'll follow you

I'll give you all of me, give me all of you
I gotta go sometimes
But you're always on my mind

See you distract me, but I'm distracted without you
I don't know how to focus, baby, teach me how to
'Cause I'm standing still again
'Cause if you love me, just like the way that I love you
I wouldn't mind a little comforting from you
Why do I let you in my head?
No
And I gotta go sometimes, but you're always on my mind
You're not helping me, babe
You're not helping me, babe
But I fall helplessly for you, for you
You're not helping me, babe
You're not helping me, babe
But I fall helplessly for you, for you
