Will you put your back on me
And keep me going?
The ground is clinging to my feet
The room is spinning around and around
I need some sorrows to drown

So will you come and talk with me?
And keep me company?
I'm right where I need to be

Yeah we lost it in the people we know
Yeah we lost it and blamed it on someone
Am I too young to keep this going?
Am I too young to keep it?

So we lost it in the people we know
Yeah we lost it and blamed it on someone
Am I too young to keep this going?
Am I too young to keep it?

Pushing through the sticks and stones for conversation
Broken boys and broken homes
Out on vacation I hate this place
But wander here all the time

So will you come and talk with me?
And keep me company?
I'm right where I need to be
Please say something
Will you come and talk with me?
And keep me company?
I'm right where I need to be

Yeah we lost it in the people we know
Yeah we lost it and blamed it on someone
Am I too young to keep this going?
Am I too young to keep it?

So they say
So they say
So they say
So they say

Yeah we lost it in the people we know
Yeah we lost it and blamed it on someone
Am I too young to keep this going?
Am I too young?

And we lost it in the people we know
Yeah we lost it and blamed it on someone
Am I too young to keep this going?
Am I too young to keep this going?
To keep this going?
Yeah am I too young?
