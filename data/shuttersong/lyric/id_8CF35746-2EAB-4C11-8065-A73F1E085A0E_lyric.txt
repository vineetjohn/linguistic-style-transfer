You got in my head, boy, like a song
That I kept on singing all along
But the radio stopped to play us long ago
Long ago

Guess I've had enough, boy, guess I'm done
Like a burning fire now it's gone
Thought I saw myself in you, I made a mistake
There's nothing to say, I'm walking away

Gonna take a miracle, oh…
Gonna take a miracle to heal this love
Baby, I won't stay another night
This time I say goodbye, I'm letting you go
Gonna take a miracle, oh…

It was a one-way road for you and I
Yeah, we built this castle based on lies
And now we have hit the point of no return
We crash and we burn, you live and you learn

Gonna take a miracle, oh…
Gonna take a miracle to heal this love
Baby, I won't stay another night
This time I say goodbye, I'm letting you go

Yeah, gonna take a miracle, oh…
Gonna take a miracle to save us now
And I won't pretend to be alright
My heart is on the line, our end is my start, oh…

(Mira-mira-miracle)
Hey (Mira-mira-mira)
Mira-mira-miracle

(Gonna take a miracle)
(Mira-mira-miracle)
Ooh… (Mira-mira-mira)
Mira-mira-miracle

Oh, gonna take a miracle, oh…
Gonna take a miracle to save us now
Gonna take a mira-mira-miracle, mira-mira-mira
Mira-mira-miracle to save us now
