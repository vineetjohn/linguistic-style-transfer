Come 'ere, baby
You know you drive me up the wall
The way you make good on all the nasty tricks you pull
Seems like we're makin' up more than we're makin' love
And it always seems you got someone on your mind other than me
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways
You hear me?
Say you're leavin' on the seven-thirty train
And that you're headin' out to Hollywood
Girl, you been givin' me the line so many times
It kinda gets like feelin' bad looks good, yeah
That kinda lovin'
Turns a man to a slave
That kinda lovin'
Sends a man right to his grave
I go crazy, crazy
Baby, I go crazy
You turn it on, then you're gone
Yeah, you drive me
Crazy, crazy
Crazy for you, baby
What can I do, honey?
I feel like the color blue
You're packin' up your stuff and talkin' like it's tough
And tryin' to tell me that it's time to go, yeah
But I know you ain't wearin' nothin' underneath that overcoat, whoa
And it's all a show, yeah
That kinda lovin'
Makes me wanna pull down the shade, yeah
That kinda lovin'
Yeah, now I'm never, never, never, never gonna be the same
I go crazy, crazy
Baby, I go crazy
You turn it on, then you're gone
Yeah, you drive me
Crazy, crazy
Crazy for you, baby
What can I do, honey?
I feel like the color blue
I'm losin' my mind, girl
'Cause I'm goin' crazy
I need your love, honey
I need your love
Crazy, crazy
Crazy for you, baby
You turn it on, then you're gone
Yeah, you drive me
Crazy, crazy
Crazy for you, baby
I'm losin' my mind, girl
'Cause I'm goin' crazy
Crazy, crazy
Crazy for you, baby
I'm losin' my mind, girl
'Cause I'm goin' crazy
Crazy, crazy
Crazy for you, baby
You turn it on, then you're gone
Yeah, you drive me
Uhuhuhuh...
