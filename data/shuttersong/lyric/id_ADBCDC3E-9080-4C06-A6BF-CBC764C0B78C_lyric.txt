The first time that I saw you
I had to get to know you
I could see a sparkle
When you looked in my eyes
And then I saw you smiling
And like a star you're shining
Never had this feeling

You warmed it up inside.
It doesn't matter where you are
Your shining light will guide me home to where you are

It doesn't matter where you are

Your shining light will guide me home to where you are
Shining star
Give me
Give me
Give me
Give me right now
You give me right now
You give me right now
(Shining star)
Give me
Give me
Give me
Give me right now
You give me right now

You give me right now
You tell me that you're lonely

And time is moving slowly

Complaining that you miss me
Cause I'm never at home
But baby don't you worry

I'll be there in a hurry
I will cross the oceans
To hold you in my arms
T doesn't matter where you are

Your shining light will guide me home to where you are
It doesn't matter where you are
Your shining light will guide me home to where you are
Shining star

Give me
Give me
Give me
Give me right now

You give me right now
You give me right now

(Shining star)
Give me
Give me
Give me
Give me right now
You give me right now

You give me right now
T doesn't matter where you are
Your shining light will guide me home to where you are
It doesn't matter where you are
Your shining light will guide me home to where you are
Shining star
Give me
Give me
Give me
Give me right now
You give me right now
You give me right now
(Shining star)
Give me
Give me
Give me
Give me right now
You give me right now
You give me right now
Shining star
Give me
Give me
Give me
Give me right now
You give me right now
You give me right now
(Shining star)
Give me
Give me
Give me
Give me right now
You give me right now
You give me right now
