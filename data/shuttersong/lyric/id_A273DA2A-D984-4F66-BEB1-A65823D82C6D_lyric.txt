As soon as I touch down in they city
Man, they all coming out
They love me in New York
And down South
They know I'm from the Westside
And I stay with the loud

Big kush, long money
Bad girls, real niggas here with me
Everywhere I go, you know I'm solid
A1 with these girls, you know I'm solid
Hunnid with my bros, you know I'm solid

Oh, I'm solid
Everywhere I go, your boy solid

Tricking, she ain't yours, that ain't solid

Wouldn't give that ass a dollar

You ain't drop none on this
