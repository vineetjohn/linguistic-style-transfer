As the rain, keeps pouring down on me
And the sky is the only thing I see
And my troubles are gone with the wind
It's just me, and the ground beneath my feet.

I feel so alive
Oh I feel so alive.
Oh I feel so alive
Oooooh
Oh I feel so alive
Oooooh

As the rain, keeps falling down on me
And my shadow is the only thing I see
All my troubles are gone with the wind
It's just me, and the ground beneath my feet.

I feel so alive.
Oh I feel so alive
Oooooh

Bones to bones,
they can bring their guns
I'm at, war with the world
There is, no where to run no

Chest to chest,
You can, run if you want
I've come too far, oh I'm not gunna lose
I feel so alive.

I feel so alive
Oh I feel so alive
Oooooh
Oh I feel so alive
Oh I feel so alive
Oooooh


Bones to bones,
they can bring their guns
I'm at, war with the world
There is, no where to run no

Chest to chest,
You can, run if you want
I've come too far, oh I'm not gunna lose
I feel so alive.
