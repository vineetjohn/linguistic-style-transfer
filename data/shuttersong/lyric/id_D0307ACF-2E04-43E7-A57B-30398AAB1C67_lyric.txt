I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you

I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you
I need you the most.

I gave you the key when the door wasn't open
Just admit it
See I gave you faith turned your doubt into hoping, can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me, where are you now that I need ya?

Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Couldn't find you anywhere.

When you broke down I didn't leave ya
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya? (now)

Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya? (now)
I gave you attention when nobody else was payin' hmm
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you saying?
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playin', that's for sure (that's for sure)
And I was on my knees when nobody else was prayin', oh Lord.

Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you, Where are you now that I need ya?
I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you the most.

Where are you now that I need ya? (now)
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya? (now)
I need you the most
I need you the most
I need you the most
