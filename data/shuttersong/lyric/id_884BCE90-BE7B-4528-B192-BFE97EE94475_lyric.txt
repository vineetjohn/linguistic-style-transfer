We cut the legs off of our pants
Threw our shoes into the oceans
Sit back and wave through the daylight
Sit back and wave through the daylight

Slip and slide on subway grates
These shoes are poor man's ice skates
Fall through like change in the daylight
Fall through like change in the daylight

I miss yellow lines in my roads
Some color on monochrome
Maybe I'll paint them in myself
Maybe I'll paint them in myself

These sidewalks liquid then stone
Building walls and an old pay phone
It rings like all through the daylight

It rings like all through the daylight
And in the daylight we can hitchhike to Maine
I hope that someday I'll see without these frames
And in the daylight I don't pick up my phone

'Cause in the daylight anywhere feels like home
I have five clocks in my life
And only one has the time right
I'll just unplug it for today

I'll just unplug it for today
Open hydrant rolled down windows
This car might make a good old boat
And float down Grand Street in daylight

And float down Grand Street in daylight
And float down Grand Street in daylight
And float down Grand Street in daylight
And float down Grand Street in daylight
And float down Grand Street in daylight
And with just half of a sunburn
New yellow lines that I earned
Step back and here comes the night time

Step back and here comes the night time
And in the daylight we can hitchhike to Maine
I hope that someday I'll see without these frames
And in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
'Cause in the daylight anywhere feels like home
And in the daylight we can hitchhike to Maine
I hope that someday I'll see without these frames
And in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
'Cause in the daylight anywhere feels like home
