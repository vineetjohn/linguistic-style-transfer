I don't ever ask you where you've been
And I don't feel the need to know who you're with
I can't even think straight, but I can tell
That you were just with her
And I'll still be a fool
'Cause I'm a fool for you
Just a little bit of your heart

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
I don't ever tell you how I really feel

Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean
And nothing's ever easy, that's what they say
I know I'm not your only
But I'll still be a fool
'Cause I'm a fool for you
Just a little bit of your heart

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
(Just a little bit)

(Hmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I know I'm not your only
But at least I'm one
I heard a little love
Is better than none
(Oh, babe)
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
