My blue bucket of gold
Friend, why don't you love me?
Once the myth has been told


The lens deforms it as lightning
Raise your right hand
Tell me you want me in your life
Or raise your red flag
Just when I want you in my life
Search for things to extol
Friend, the fables delight me
My blue bucket of gold
Lord, touch me with lightning
Raise your right hand
Tell me you want me in your life
Or raise your red flag
Just when I want you in my life
