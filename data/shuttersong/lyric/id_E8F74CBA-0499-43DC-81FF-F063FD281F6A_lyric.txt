Cleopatra - The Lumineers
Written By£ºWesley Schultz/Jeremy Fraites/Simone Felice
I was Cleopatra I was young and an actress
When you knelt by my mattress and asked for my hand
But I was sad you asked it as I laid in a black dress
With my father in a casket I had no plans
And I left the footprints the mud stained on the carpet
And it hardened like my heart did when you left town
But I must admit it that I would marry you in an instant
Damn your wife I'd be your mistress just to have you around
But I was late for this late for that
Late for the love of my life
And when I die alone when I die alone
When I die I'll be on time
While the church discouraged any lust that burned within me
Yes my flesh it was my currency but I held true
So I drive a taxi and the traffic distracts me
From the strangers in my backseat they remind me of you
But I was late for this late for that
Late for the love of my life
And when I die alone when I die alone
When I die I'll be on time
And the only gifts from my Lord were a birth and a divorce
But I've read this script and the costume fits so I'll play my part
I was Cleopatra I was taller than the rafters
But that's all in the past now gone with the wind
Now a nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom
It's a bed and a bathroom
A place for the end
I won't be late for this late for that
Late for the love of my life
And when I die alone when I die alone
When I die I'll be on time
