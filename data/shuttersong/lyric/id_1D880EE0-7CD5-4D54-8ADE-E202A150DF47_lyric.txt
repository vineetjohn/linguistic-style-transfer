Oh my love
I know I am a cold cold man.
Quite slow to pay you compliments.
Or public displayed affections.

But baby don't you go overanalyze
No need to theorize
I can put your doubts to rest.

You're the only one worth seeing.
The only place worth being.
The only bed worth sleeping in is the one right next to you.

You're the only one worth seeing.
The only place worth being.
The only bed worth sleeping in is the one right next to you.

Oh my love
I know you're used to desperate men.
Who say the words that others said
For too long and for too often.

But baby you can lay off a little bit
No need to smother it
I can put your doubts to rest.

You're the only one worth seeing.
The only place worth being.
The only bed worth sleeping in is the one right next to you.
You're the only one worth seeing.
The only place worth being.
The only bed worth sleeping's the one right next to you.
