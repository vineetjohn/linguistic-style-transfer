If I could live forever then
I don't know what I'd do
Forgot just what I meant to say
But I'm still in love with you
The future sounds boring
Without the one you love
So while we're here in here and now
Can we have some fun

Let's make out
Let's make out
Let's make out
(Ooo-Ooo-Ooo)
Let's make out
(Ooo-Ooo-Ooo)

I don't even know your name
I don't even know your number
But I know I need you right now

Living in a crazy world
You make me kinda crazy girl
Tell me if you need me right now

If you love somebody (hey)
You should tell somebody (oh oh)
Do you love somebody
Go and tell somebody
T-t-tell somebody

If I could live forever then
I don't know what I'd do
Forgot just what I meant to say
But I'm still in love with you
The future sounds boring
Without the one you love
So while we're here in here and now
Can't we have some fun

Let's make out
Let's make out
Let's make out
(Ooo-Ooo-Ooo)
Let's make out

I just want to hold your hand
I just want to pull you closer
Baby do you feel like I do
Baby if you hang around
I can see it going down
And get a little freaky with you

If you love somebody
You should tell somebody
Do you love somebody
Go and tell somebody
T-t-tell somebody

If I could live forever then
I don't know what I'd do
Forgot just what I meant to say
