I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all

What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over
'Til it's over, but it's far from over

Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck it y'all thinkin'?
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'
'Bout to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett

I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home?
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known

Got the gold thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super-good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker

Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either
Point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it throwin' hundreds
When I should be throwin' ones, bitch, I run it

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all

What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over
'Til it's over, but it's far from over

One thing about music, when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got the shit that makes these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's what comes with the fame and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin'

I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over

So I'm riding through this city with my high-beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your wide screen on
If you thinkin' I'mma quit before I die, dream on

Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin'?
And nobody's ever done it like I did it
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over
'Til it's over, but it's far from over
Yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over
'Til it's over, but it's far from over
