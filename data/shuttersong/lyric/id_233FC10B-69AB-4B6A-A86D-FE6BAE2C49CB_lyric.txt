Let's start a war for the kids
A purpose for which to unite
Make them some words they can mince
What they don't know
They won't mind
Find them a foe for the fight
And stories to tell as they age
Then maybe time will decide
Which ones keep and which ones fade

There's the deepest sleep in my blood
From which I am slowly coming to
And every morning i wait for the news
Oh, this is,
This is post war blues

Make me a means to an end
Make me an ending in sight
Make me insightful again
What I can't see
I can't fight
Make me a fire to burn
Burn all the letter I wrote
Write me a list of concerns
If we are at peace
If we are at peace
I wanna know

There's the deepest sleep in my blood
From which I am slowly coming to
And every morning I wait for the news
Oh, this is
This is post war blues
Oh, this is
This is post war blues
