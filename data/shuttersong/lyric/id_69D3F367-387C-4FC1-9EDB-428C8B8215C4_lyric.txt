You call me on a lazy afternoon
Asking me what I'm up to
Let's find something to do
Baby, I'd be down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
You know I'd be down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
I see you arriving in your car
Jet black Mercedes, built in the 70s

Classic like you and me
I'll be coming down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
I'll be coming down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
I feel a little rush
I think I've got a little crush on you
I hope it's not too much
But babe when I'm with you, I hear it

My heart singing
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la
Honestly I shouldn't waste time no more
'Cause all these little boys you're chasing, did they break your heart?
I know you've been down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
I won't let you down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down

I feel a little rush
I think I've got a little crush on you
I hope it's not too much
But girl when I'm with you, I hear it
My heart singing
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la
I see you the same
I see it in the way that you behave around me
And I can't tell
What we have is different from anyone else
'Cause you stop doing what you're doing
When I call you come to me running

And I would do the same for you
So tell me that you feel it too
I feel a little rush
I think I've got a little crush on you
I hope it's not too much
But babe when I'm with you, I hear it
My heart singing
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la
I think I've got a crush, babe (Crush on you too)
Feel a little rush, baby (I feel it too)
