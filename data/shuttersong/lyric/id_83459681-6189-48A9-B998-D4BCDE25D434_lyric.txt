Avicii - Hey Brother¸è´Ê(feat. Dan Tyminski) Lyrics 
Hey, brother.
There's an endless road to rediscover.
Hey, sister.
Know the water's sweet but blood is thicker.
Ooooooh, if the sky comes falling down.
For you.
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do.
Hey, brother.
Do you still believe in one another?
Hey, sister.
Do you still believe in love, I wonder?
 
Ooooooh, if the sky comes falling down.
For you.
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do.
What if I'm far from home?
Oh brother I will hear you call.
What if I'd lose it all?
Oh sister, I will help you out.
Ooooooh, if the sky comes falling down.
For you.
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do.
Hey, brother.
There's an endless road to rediscover.
Hey, sister.
Do you still believe in love, I wonder?
Ooooooh, if the sky comes falling down.
For you.
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do.
What if I'm far from home?
Oh brother I will hear you call.
What if I'd lose it all?
Oh sister, I will help you out.
Ooooooh, if the sky comes falling down.
For you.
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do.
