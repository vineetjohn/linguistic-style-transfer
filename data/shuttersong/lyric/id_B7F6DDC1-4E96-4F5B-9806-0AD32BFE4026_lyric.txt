We hold to the lies to feel free
So shackled by smiles, so empty
We're scared of the war so we've forgotten who we are

We've traded in hope for safety
We're raising the smoke
Insisting that we're all to die to light the fire and shake the earth

But if all we are is just machines
Then let's become a miracle and break free from these chains
We must be more than just machines

So let them hear our hearts
So let them hear our hearts
So let them hear our hearts
So let them hear our hearts

Where will you run?
When there's no place left for you to hide
When you're faced with the fire
Will you step for the future and swallow your pride?

Where will you run? Will you run?
Sometimes you can't wake up

The only one that is here
I'll scream at the top of my lungs
Walking around in blood
But if all we are is just machines
Then let's become a miracle and break free from these chains

We must be more than just machines
So let them hear our hearts
So let them hear our hearts
Where will you run?

When there's no place left for you to hide
When you're faced with the fire
Will you step for the future and swallow your pride?
Where will you run?

When there's no place left for you to hide
When you're faced with the fire
Will you step
for the future and swallow your pride?
If all we are is just machines
Then we must be the cogs inside the wheels of change
We must be more than just machines
We can't afford to hide, we must embrace the pain
If all we are is just machines
Then we must be the cogs inside the wheels of change
We must be more than just machines
We can't afford to hide, we must embrace the pain
Where will you run?
When there's no place left for you to hide
When you're faced with the fire
Will you step for the future and swallow your pride?
