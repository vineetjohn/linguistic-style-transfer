I was gonna write you a love song just the other day
So I sat down and thought real hard but nothing ever came
I took a walk downtown and it hit me like a train
So I grabbed a napkin and started scribbling away

And I was like woah-oh, woah-oh
Sexy can't make up for crazy, no-oh, no-oh
And girl, you crazy as shit

This song's for selfish girls
They want the whole wide world
They just want everything
(We just want everything)
And they cry when the sky ain't blue
This song's for selfish girls
They want the whole wide world
I give them everything
And there ain't nothing I can do

Look, she walked into my life, all innocent and shit
And then she took my credit card and dipped
Gave me a kiss, then turned around and stole the keys to my whip
Aw man, what a selfish bitch
She was like, "See ya, I wouldn't wanna be ya"
Kidnapped my Visa then she hit the galleria
Let's have a moment of silence for what I say next
R.I.P to all my paychecks
Supermodel but the inside's ugly
Yeah, and I'm over it like a fraction
She loved herself way more than she loved me
Only cared about her Instagram captions
So this the last song I'm ever gonna write for ya
Go find a douchebag, maybe he'll be right for ya
And if you wonder why your phone ain't ringing
Call my voicemail, and I'mma start singing

This song's for selfish girls
They want the whole wide world
They just want everything
(We just want everything)
And they cry when the sky ain't blue
This song's for selfish girls
They want the whole wide world
I give them everything
And there ain't nothing I can do

(La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la)
I thought you were a dime but you loved me for my dimes
Selfish girls will be the death of me, this happens every time
I thought you were a dime but you loved me for my dimes
Selfish girls will be the death of me, this happens every time

And I was like woah-oh, woah-oh
Sexy can't make up for crazy, no-oh, no-oh
And girl, oh my God...

This song's for selfish girls
They want the whole wide world
They just want everything
(We just want everything)
And they cry when the sky ain't blue
This song's for selfish girls (you're so selfish)
They want the whole wide world (why you so selfish?)
I give them everything
