Now that you're out of my life I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you but I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you but I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you I laugh harder
You thought I wouldn't grow without you now I'm wiser
Though that I'd be helpless without you but I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you but I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you sold 9 million
I'm a survivor (What?)
I'm not gon give up (What?)
I'm not gon stop (What?)
I'm gon work harder (What?)
I'm a survivor (What?)
I'm gonna make it (What?)
I will survive (What?)
Keep on survivin' (What?)

Thought I couldn't breathe without I'm inhaling
You thought I couldn't see without you perfect vision
You thought I couldn't last without you nut I'm lastin'
You thought that I would die without you but I'm livin'
You thought that I would fail without you but I'm on top
Thought it would be over by now but it won't stop

You thought that I would self destruct but I'm still here
Even in my years to come I'm still gon be here
