Look at what you¡¯ve done
Stand still, fallin¡¯ away from me
When it takes so long,
Fire¡¯s out, what do you want to be?


I¡¯m holdidn¡¯ on,
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There¡¯s a power in what you do,
Now, every other day I¡¯ll be watching you


Oh-oh, Oh-oh,
Show you what it feels like,
Now I¡¯m on the outside
Oh-oh,
We did everything right, now I¡¯m on the outside
Oh-oh,
Show you what it feels like,
Now I¡¯m on the outside
Oh-oh,
We did everything right, now I¡¯m on the outside


Though you give me no reason
For me to stay close to you,
Tell me what lovers do
How are we still breathing?
It¡¯s never for us to choose,
I¡¯ll be the strength in you.


I¡¯m holdidn¡¯ on (I¡¯m holdidn¡¯ on)
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There¡¯s a power in what you do,
Now, every other day I¡¯ll be watching you


Oh-oh, Oh-oh,
Show you what it feels like,
Now I¡¯m on the outside
Oh-oh,
We did everything right, now I¡¯m on the outside
Oh-oh,
Show you what it feels like,
Now I¡¯m on the outside
Oh-oh,
We did everything right, now I¡¯m on the outside


I¡¯ll show you what it feels like,
Now I¡¯m on the outside (eeeey)
I¡¯ll show you what it feels like,
Show you what it feels like,
Now I¡¯m on the outside
Oh-oh,
We did everything right, now I¡¯m on the outside
