"You & Me"
(feat. Eliza Doolittle)

I'll be giving up, oh
Home is where the heart is,
And I gave it to you in a paper bag
Even though it's tarnished
You told me it's the best you ever had
You got my secret combination
And I don't be giving that out easily
With my deepest dedication
You can tell that you were brought the same for me

So please don't let go, cause you know exactly what we found
So please don't let go my darling
You keep me locked up underground
It's gonna be you and me
It's gonna be everything you've ever dreamed
It's gonna be who and me
It's gonna be everything and everything, we're meant to be
We're meant to be

Rolling with the punches
So they won't get inside our happiness
Love is always hunted,
But your arrows are soaring through my chest
Cause you know you give me something
Yeah you give me exactly what I need
Got my blood pumping
You know you always draw more blood, I bleed

So please don't let go, cause you know exactly what we found
So please don't let go my darling
You keep me locked up underground
It's gonna be you and me
It's gonna be everything you've ever dreamed
It's gonna be who and me
It's gonna be everything and everything, we're meant to be

In your big house on the hills
Where you keep your dollar bills
And you stashed my heart
Somewhere in the dark
Keep it safe I know you will
Know you will, know you will
Know you will
I know you will
