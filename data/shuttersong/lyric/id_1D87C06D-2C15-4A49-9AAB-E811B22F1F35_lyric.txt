Uhh
Dolar Sign
 I see two of my bitches in the club
And  I know they know about each other
 I think these  bitches tryna set me up
Maybe  I¡¯m just paranoid
 I got a bad light skin from  the valley
She be  in  the  club with no panties
Little  bitch, she used to be  my favorite
But now we don¡¯t speak  the same language
 I love  my  bitch,  I could bang it
From  my dark skin, least know how to take it
 I got em both  the same damn red bottoms
And bought 'em both  the same damn fragrance
Both  bitches drive Range Rovers
None  of  my  bitches can stay over
Both  of  my  bitches look good as fuck
Your  bitch look like booga wolf
 I  see  two  of  my  bitches  in  the  club
And  I know they know about each other
 I think these  bitches tryna set me up
Maybe  I¡¯m just paranoid
Yeah,  I¡¯m paranoid,  I¡¯m trippin'
 I¡¯ve been smoking,  I¡¯ve been sippin'
 I¡¯m fuckin' around with  two  bitches
But  I never made them hoes  my miss's
Women talk, women talk
She run her mouth so much she can¡¯t hear her own thoughts
Told  my old ho, she  my new  bitch
Told  my new  bitch, she  my old ho
Well she used to be your ho
Dead, hold up, flat-line
 I fuck a  bitch to sleep, nap time
 I put  my name on it and that¡¯s mine
Pussy so wet she thought it got baptized
Ask me where  I¡¯m at, that¡¯s a set-up
You ain¡¯t talkin' bout nothing,  bitch shut up
If you got a side chick, nigga what up
Both  my girls  in  the  club bout to nut up
Stalking on  my network
Got her looking so hard that her neck hurt
And  I ain¡¯t tripping,  I got room for 'em both
This is HAM Squad,  I just doubled up  my net worth
 I  see  two  of  my  bitches  in  the  club
And  I know they know about each other
 I think these  bitches tryna set me up
Maybe  I¡¯m just paranoid
Yeah,  I¡¯m paranoid,  I¡¯m trippin'
 I¡¯ve been smoking,  I¡¯ve been sippin'
 I¡¯m fuckin' around with  two  bitches
But  I never made them hoes  my miss's
Yeah,  I¡¯m paranoid,  I¡¯m trippin'
 I¡¯ve been smoking,  I¡¯ve been sippin'
 I¡¯m fuckin' around with  two  bitches
But  I never made them hoes  my miss's
 I  see  two  of  my  bitches  in  the  club
And  I know they know about each other
 I think these  bitches tryna set me up
Maybe  I¡¯m just paranoid
