Comparisons are easily done once you've
Had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree

I pick the ripest one
I still got the seed

You said move on, where do I go?
I guess second best is all I will know
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you

Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was

Spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes
You're like an Indian summer in the middle of a winter

Like a hard candy with the surprise center
How do I get better once I've had the best?

You said, there's tons of fish in the waters
So the waters I will test
He kissed my lips, I taste your mouth

He pulled me in, I was disgusted with myself
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you

What you would do if
You were the one who was
Spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into you're the best, and yes I do regret
How I could let myself, let you go?
Now, now the lessons learned
I touched, I was burned
Oh, I think you should know
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your
Your eyes, looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
I want you walk through
And bust in the door and take me away
No more mistakes
'Cause in your eyes I'd like to stay
Stay
