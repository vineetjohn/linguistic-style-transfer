Come with me now
Come with me now
Woah, Come with me now
I'm gon' take you down
Woah, Come with me now
I'm gon' show you how
Woah, Come with me now
I'm gon' take you down
Woah, Come with me now
I'm gon' show you how

Afraid to lose control
Caught up in this world
I've wasted time, I've wasted breath
I think I've thought myself to death
I was born without this fear
Now only this seems clear

I need to move, I need to fight, I need to lose myself tonight

Woah, Come with me now
I'm gon' take you down
Woah, Come with me now
I'm gon' show you how
I think with my heart and I move with my head
I open my mouth and it's something I've read
I've stood at the store before I'm told
but a part of me knows that I'm growing too old
Confused what I thought was something I felt
Confused what I feel with something that's real

I tried to sell my soul last night
Funny, you wouldn't even take a bite

Far away
I heard him say
(Come with me now)
Don't delay
I heard him say
(Come with me now)
Far away
I heard him say
(Come with me now)

Don't delay
I heard him say
(Come with me now)

Woah, Come with me now
I'm gon' take you down
Woah, Come with me now
I'm gon' show you how

Afraid to lose control
Caught up in this world

I've wasted time, I've wasted breath
I think I've thought myself to death
I Was Born without this fear
Now only this seems clear
I need to move, I need to fight, I need to lose myself tonight
Woah, Come with me now
Woah, Come with me now
I'm gon' take you down
Woah, Come with me now
