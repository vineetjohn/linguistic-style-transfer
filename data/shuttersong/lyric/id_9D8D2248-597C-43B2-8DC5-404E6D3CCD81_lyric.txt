Something, someone
Turned out to be
Something I should've known
Will be the death of me

I promise I'm usually better than this

You turned me into this

Please, give me something to
Convince me that I am not a monster
Babe, give me one excuse
Give me one excuse

Give me one...
Give me one...
Give me one...
Give me one...
Give me one...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

Please, give me something to
Convince me that I am not a monster
Babe, give me one excuse
Give me one excuse

Give me one, give me one, oh oh
