High dive into frozen waves
Where the past comes back to life
Fight fear for the selfish pain
It was worth it every time
Hold still right before we crash
'Cause we both know how this ends
A clock ticks till it breaks your glass
And I drown in you again

'Cause you are the piece of me
I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly
Still fight and I don't know why

If our love is tragedy
Why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity
Why are you my clarity?

If our love is tragedy
Why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity
Why are you my clarity?

Walk on through a red parade
And refuse to make amends
It cuts deep through our ground
And makes us forget all common sense

Don't speak as I try to leave
'Cause we both know what we'll choose
If you pull, then I'll push too deep
And I'll fall right back to you

'Cause you are the piece of me
I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly
Still fight and I don't know why

If our love is tragedy
Why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity
Why are you my clarity?

Why are you my clarity? (Clarity, clarity)
Why are you my remedy? (Remedy, remedy)
Why are you my clarity? (Clarity, clarity)
Why are you my remedy? (Remedy, remedy)
If our love is tragedy
Why are you, my remedy?
If our love's insanity
Why are you my clarity?
