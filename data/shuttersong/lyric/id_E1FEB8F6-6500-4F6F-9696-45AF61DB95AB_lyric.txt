Daylight - Maroon 5
Here I am waiting  i'll have to leave soon
Why am i  holding on 
We knew this day would come  we knew it all along
How did it  come so fast 
This is our last night but it's late
And i'm trying not to sleep
Cause I know  when I wake  I will have to slip away
And when the daylight comes i'll have to go
But tonight i'm gonna hold you so close
Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Oh-woah  oh-woah  oh-woah
Oh-woah  oh-woah  oh-woah
Here I am staring at your perfection
My arms  beautifulso 
This guy is getting dired cause stalls are burning out
Somebody slow it down
This is way too hard  cause I know
When the sun comes out  I will leave
This is my last glance that will soon be memory
And when the daylight comes i'll have to go
But tonight i'm gonna hold you so close
Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Oh-woah  oh-woah  oh-woah
Oh-woah  oh-woah  oh-woah
I never wanted to stop because I don't wanna stuck alone babe  stuck alone babe
I was afraid of the dark but now it's all that I want  all that I want  all that I want
And when the daylight comes i'll have to go
But tonight i'm gonna hold you so close
Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
And when the daylight comes i'll have to go
But tonight i'm gonna hold you so close
Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Oh-woah  oh-woah  oh-woah
Oh-woah  oh-woah  oh-woah
Oh-woah (yeah)  oh-woah (yeah)  oh-woah (yeah)
Oh-woah (yeah)  oh-woah (yeah)  oh-woah
