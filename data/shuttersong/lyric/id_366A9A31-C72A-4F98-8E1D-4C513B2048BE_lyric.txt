Lately I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow, out.
Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's, out

Shame, on me.
To need, release.
Uncontrollably...

I-I-I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay
taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-o-o all the dir-ir-irt
I got running through my mind...
Wo-oh-oh
I-I-I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay
taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-o-o all the dir-ir-irt

I got running through my mind...
Wo-oh-oh
Lately people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to e-rupt
Time to blow, out.
I've been told just what you do with it

We keep both my hands above the bla- blanket
When the light's, out.
Shame, on me.

To need, release.
Uncontrollably...
I-I-I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay
taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-o-o all the dir-ir-irt
I got running through my mind...
Wo-oh-oh
I-I-I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay

taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-o-o all the dir-ir-irt
I got running through my mind...

Wo-oh-oh
Shame, on me (shame on me...)
To need, release (to need, release...)
Uncontrollably (uncontrollably, -lably, -lably, -lably...)
I-I-I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay
taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-o-o all the dir-ir-irt
I got running through my mind...
I-I-I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay
taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-o-o all the dir-ir-irt
I got running through my mind...
Wo-oh-oh
