It's 3 in the morning and everybody already in bed
We're tired and we're yawning but I got something else in mind instead
Cause I been trying to hold these urges back baby all day
We're hand in hand, body on body
I still want you in my space

So we can do it your way, way, way, way, way
I just want your body on me, me, me, me, me
Cause you got me like ooooo ooooo
I just wanna love you till you're on your way

So tonight
I'm gonna rock you like a baby tonight
I'm gonna love you every second your mine
We can go until the morning
I just wanna love you till you're on your way
I just wanna love you till you're on your way
I just wanna love you till you're on your way
Tonight
I'm gonna rock you like a baby
I just wanna love you till you're on your way
Your way, yeah

I lay back and watch you hoping that you're gonna wanna stay
But you're such a hustler and I know you gotta get your pay
I just wanna love you like this was the last time
The time with you has been a dream
Tonight let's live out everything

So we can do it your way, way, way, way, way
I just want your body on me, me, me, me, me
Cause you got me like ooooo yeah ooooo yeah
I just wanna love you till you're on your way

So tonight
I'm gonna rock you like a baby tonight
I'm gonna love you every second your mine
We can go until the morning
I just wanna love you till you're on your way
I just wanna love you till you're on your way
I just wanna love you till you're on your way
Tonight
I'm gonna rock you like a baby
I just wanna love you till you're on your way
Your way, yeah

Well I'm afraid this is turning to something
Something I don't feel that often, wanting
I've been trying to fight back these urges
That isn't working
Your name is all in my searches
I think that we waited long enough
I think that this love feels strong enough
I think I dealt with your mom enough
I think that I wrote you songs enough
Did what you want enough
Turned you on enough
I want you to tell me if this feels wrong or something girl
I want us to get past the basics
I think I know where we can take it
Cause I can show you a few me and you things
I'm really in love with the way your hips and your mood swings
Makes it all the better when we making up
And we can do it all again while you waking up

So tonight
I'm gonna rock you like a baby tonight
I'm gonna love you every second your mine
We can go until the morning
I just wanna love you till you're on your way
I just wanna love you till you're on your way
I just wanna love you till you're on your way
Tonight
I'm gonna rock you like a baby
I just wanna love you till you're on your way
Your way, yeah
