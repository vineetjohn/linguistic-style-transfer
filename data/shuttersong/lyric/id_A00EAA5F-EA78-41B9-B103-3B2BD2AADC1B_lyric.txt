Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby

Been waiting on that sunshine
Boy, I think I need that back
Can't do it like that
No one else gonna get it like that
So I argue, you yell, had to take me back
Who cares when it feels like crack?
Boy you know that you always do it right
Man, fuck your pride, just take it on back, boy
Take it on back boy, take it back all night
Just take it on back, take it on back
Mmm, do what you gotta do, keep me up all night
Hurting bad man, and it hurts inside when I look you in your eye

What are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you're willing to do?
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
What are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you're willing to do?
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
