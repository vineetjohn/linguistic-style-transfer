Fresh cut grass, one cold beer.
Thank to Lord, I am here and now, here and now.
Summer dress, favorite park.
Bless your soul, we are here and now, here and now.

I'm wide awake
So what's the point of dreaming when your life is great?
Celebrate the feeling
Celebrate the feeling

Can't complain about much these days, I believe we'll be okay
Oh oh oho oh oh oho
Can't complain about much these days, I believe we'll be okay
Oh oh oho oh oh oho
We're screaming out, I believe we'll be okay

Sun kissed skin on my lips
Thank to Lord, I am here and now, here and now
Fireflies after dark
Bless your soul we are here and now, here and now

I'm wide awake
So what's the point of dreaming when your life is great?
Celebrate the feeling
Celebrate the feeling

Can't complain about much these days, I believe we'll be okay
Oh oh oho oh oh oho
Can't complain about much these days, I believe we'll be okay
Oh oh oho oh oh oho
We're screaming out, I believe we'll be okay

We'll be okay. We'll be okay.
Can't complain about much these days, I believe we'll be okay
Can't complain about much these days, I believe we'll be okay
Oh oh oho oh oh oho
Can't complain about much these days, I believe we'll be okay
Oh oh oho oh oh oho
We're screaming out, I believe we'll be okay
