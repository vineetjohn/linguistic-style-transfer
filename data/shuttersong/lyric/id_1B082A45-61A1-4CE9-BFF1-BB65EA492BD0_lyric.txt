 Look she hit me up on the regular
3 AM and  she blowin'  up my cellular
Every night  she got my phone going brrr brrr
So I'm bout to serve it  up Roger Federer
Lately I've been coming through like every night
Cause  she know  she can get it whenever  she like
 She in  the bed and  she layin'  on her back
Sending pictures to my phone
Like "I'm ready where you at?"
I know  she want it
That's why  she callin'
 She got  me running
All these yellow lights
 She craving waiting for it every night
I'm speeding fiending for that paradise
That's why I'm flying through these yellow lights
Can't think twice  she want it bad
 She want it bad
Can't think twice I'm running that
Can't think twice cause  she want it bad
Full speed tryna score like a running back
Cop cars in my rear view
Tryna slow  me down now ha good luck with that
I'm swerving lanes stick shift
Windows down Tokyo Drift shit
I'm getting closer every minute
 She keep  on sending pictures to my phone
Like "I'm ready come and get it"
Can't think twice I"m running that
Girl I'm  on my way way way
Just wait  up for  me  me  me
I got what you need need need
I can't wait 'till you are next to  me
So I just keep running all of these
Yellow lights
So bad so bad
