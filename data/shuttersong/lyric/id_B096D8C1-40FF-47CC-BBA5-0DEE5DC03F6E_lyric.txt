The big wheel keeps on turning
On a simple line, day by day
The earth spins on its axis
One man struggle while another relaxes

There's a hole in my soul like a cavity
Seems the world is out to gather just by gravity
The wheel keeps turning, the sky's rearranging
Look, my son, the weather is changing

I'd like to feel that you could be free
Look up at the blue skies beneath a new tree
Sometime again, you'll turn green, and the sea turns red
My son, I said, the power of reflections over my head

The big wheel keeps on turning
On a simple line, day by day
The earth spins on its axis
One man struggle while another relaxes

We sang about the sun and danced among the trees
And we listened to the whisper of the city on the breeze
Will you cry in the most in a lead-free zone
Down within the shadows where the factories drone
On the surface of the wheel they build another town
And so the green come tumbling down
Yes, close your eyes and hold me tight
And I'll show you sunset sometime again

The big wheel keeps on turning
On a simple line, day by day
The earth spins on its axis
One man struggle while another relaxes

As a child solemn pray, my hope hides in disguise
While satellites and cameras watch from the skies
An acid drop of rain recycled from the sea
It washed away my shadow, burnt a hole in me
And all the king's men cannot put it back again
But the ghetto sun will nurture life
And mend my soul sometime again

The big wheel keeps on turning
On a simple line, day by day
The earth spins on its axis
One man struggle while another relaxes
