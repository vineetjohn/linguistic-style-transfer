I wish that I was in your shoes
Maybe I'd understand the pressure, pressure
My temper's always on the loose
I made a vow to forget her, forget her

You break the fall
It's not easy to trust
I wanna love you
But I'm just too cynical

We live the words
They never hear
I know it hurts you
But I just can't leave it alone

I caught you playing in the fire
Did you feel at home?
Did you feel at home?
My mind is winding down the spiral
I don't know where I go

You break the fall
It's not easy to trust
I wanna love you
But I'm just too cynical

We live the words
They never hear
I know it hurts you
But I just can't leave it alone

You break the fall
It's not easy to trust
I wanna love you
But I'm just too cynical

We found our ways to make it work
Two different people in one moment
You say failure is a curse
Sometimes a blessing isn't all

You break the fall
It's not easy to trust
I wanna love you
But I'm just too cynical

We live the words
They never hear
I know it hurts you
But I just can't leave it alone

You break the fall
It's not easy to trust
I wanna love you
But I'm just too cynical

We live the words
They never hear
I know it hurts you
But I just can't leave it alone

You break the fall
It's not easy to trust
I wanna love you
But I'm just too cynical

We live the words
They never hear
I know it hurts you
But I just can't leave it alone
