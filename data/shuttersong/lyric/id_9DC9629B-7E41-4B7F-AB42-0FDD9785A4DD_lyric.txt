I don't even like you
Why'd you want to go and make me feel this way?
I don't understand what's happened
I keep saying things I never say

I can feel you watching
Even when you're nowhere to be seen
I can feel you touching
Even when you're far away from me

Tell me where you're hiding your voodoo doll 'cause I can't control myself
I don't wanna stay, wanna run away but I'm trapped under your spell.
And it hurts in my head and my heart and my chest
And I'm having trouble catching my breath
Ooh ooh

Won't you please stop loving me to death?

I don't even see my friends no more
'Cause I keep hanging out with you
I don't know how you kept me up all night
Or how I got this tattoo.

I can feel you watching
Even when you're nowhere to be seen
I can feel you touching
Even when you're far away from me

Tell me where you're hiding your voodoo doll 'cause I can't control myself
I don't wanna stay, wanna run away but I'm trapped under your spell
And it hurts in my head and my heart and my chest
And I'm having trouble catching my breath
Ooh ooh

Won't you please stop loving me to death?

Every time you're near me, suddenly my heart begins to race
Every time I leave, I don't know why my heart begins to break

Tell me where you're hiding your voodoo doll 'cause I can't control myself
I don't wanna stay, wanna run away but I'm trapped under your spell
And it hurts in my head and my heart and my chest
And I'm having trouble catching my breath
Ooh ooh

Won't you please stop loving me to death?
Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey
