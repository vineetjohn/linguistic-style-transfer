Tomorrow's way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now

Tomorrow's way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now

Baby tonight I need you
And I feel it when I see you
Wherever you wanna go, whenever baby I'm yours
Tomorrow's way too far away, and we can't get back yesterday

But we young right now, we got right now
So get up right now, 'cause all we got is right now
Tomorrow's way too far away, and we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now, we got right now
So get up right now, 'cause all we got is right now
So close I can taste you

Ain't scared I can take you, can't fight the feeling
Can you feel me? You got me feel it
Something you wanted to do all your life
There's no more waiting ‒ tonight is the night
And we can't be wrong, not if it feels this right
Turn it up, scream it loud, yeah.

Tomorrow's way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now

'Cause all we got is right now
Tomorrow's way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now
