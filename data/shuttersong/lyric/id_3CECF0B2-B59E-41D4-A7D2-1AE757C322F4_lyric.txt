A soft sound
To the way that she wears her hair down
Covering up her face.
And oh what a let down
And I don't seem to be having any effect now
Falling all over the place.

But you're losing your words
We're speaking in bodies
Avoiding me and talking 'bout you.
But you're losing your turn
I guess I'll never learn
'Cause I stay another hour or two.

For crying out loud, settle down!
You know I can't be found with you
We get back to my house
Your hands, my mouth
Now I just stop myself around you.

A small town
Dictating all the people we get around
What a familiar face.
Do you get what I mean now?
I'm so fixated on the girl with the soft sound
And hair all over the place.

And you're sure that I'd learn
I'm pushing through bodies
Avoiding me and walking 'round you.
And you're cold and I burn
I guess I'll never learn
'Cause I stay another hour or two.

For crying out loud, settle down!
You know I can't be found with you
We get back to my house
Your hands, my mouth
Now I just stop myself around you.

A soft sound
And to the way that she wears her hair down
Covering up her face.
And oh what a let down
I don't seem to be having any effect now
Falling all over the place.

But you're losing your words
We're speaking in bodies
Avoiding me and talking 'bout you.
And you're losing your turn
I guess I'll never learn
'Cause I stay another hour or two.
For crying out loud, settle down!
You know I can't be found with you
We get back to my house
Your hands, my mouth
Now I just stop myself around you.
For crying out loud!
