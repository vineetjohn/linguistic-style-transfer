I cannot hide
What's on my mind
I feel it
Burning deep inside
A passion crime
To take what's mine
Let us start
Living for today

Never gonna change my mind
We can leave it all behind
Nothin's gonna stop us
No not this time

So take your hand in mine
It's ours tonight
This is a Rebel Love Song
Hearts will sacrifice
It's do or die
This is a Rebel Love Song

My outlaw eyes
Have seen their lies
I choke on
All they had to say
When worlds collide
What's left inside
I hold on tight
And hear you pray

Never gonna change my mind
We can leave it all behind
Nothin's gonna stop us
No not this time

Take your hand in mine
It's ours tonight
This is a Rebel Love Song
Hearts will sacrifice
It's do or die
This is a Rebel Love Song

Wild and running
For one reason
They can't stop us
From our freedom
(Wild and running for one reason
They can't stop us from our freedom)

Never gonna change my mind
We can leave it all behind
Nothin's gonna stop us
No not this time

So take your hand in mine
It's ours tonight
This is a Rebel Love Song
Hearts will sacrifice
It's do or die
This is a Rebel Love Song

Take your hand in mine
It's ours tonight
This is a Rebel Love Song
Hearts will sacrifice
It's do or die
This is a Rebel Love Song
