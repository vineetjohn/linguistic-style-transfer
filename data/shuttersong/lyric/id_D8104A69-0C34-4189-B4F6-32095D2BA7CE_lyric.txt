What of the dollar you murdered for
Is that the one fighting for your soul
Or your brother's the one that you're running from
But if you got money, fuck it, because I want some

Aint Nobody Fuckin wit my
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my muthafuckin
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique

Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad bitches, man, they want the

They want the, they want the, they want the

I tell a bad bitch do whatever I say
My block behind me like I'm coming out the driveway
It's grind-day, from Friday, to next Friday
I been up straight for nine days, I need a spa day
Yup, She trying get me that poo-tang
I might let my crew bang, my crew deeper than Wu Tang
I'm rolling with... fuck I'm saying? Girl, you know my crew name
You know 2 Chainz? Scrrr! I'm pulling up in that Bruce Wayne
But I'm the fucking villain, man, they kneeling when I walking in the building
Freaky women I be feeling from the bank accounts I'm filling

What a feeling, ah man, they gotta be
Young player from the D that's killing everything that he see

G.O.O.D Music drug dealing cousin, ain't nothing fuckin' with we, me
Turn that 62 to 125, 125 to a 250
250 to a half a man ain't nothin' nobody can do with me
Now who with me? ¡Vámonos! Call me Hov or Jefe
Translation, I'm the shit, at least that what my neck say
Least that what my check say, lost my homie for a decade
Nigga down for like 12 years, ain't hug his son since the second grade

And all our eyes green it only means one thing

Break records at Louie, ate breakfast at Gucci
My girl a superstar all from a home movie
Bow on our arrival - the unamerican idols
What niggas did in Paris, got em' hanging off the Eiffel
Yeah I'm talking business, we talking CIA
I'm talking George Tenet, I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach, think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented
You know white people get money don't spend it
Or maybe they get money, buy a business
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go ig'nant
I know Spike Lee gone kill me but let me finish
Blame it on the pigment, we living no limits
Them gold Master P ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination, MTV cribs
Now I'm looking at a crib right next to where TC lives
That's Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse
He wasn't really drunk he just had a few brews
Pass the refreshments, a cool, cool beverage
Everything I do need a news crew's presence
Speedboat swerve, homie watch out for the waves
I'm way too black to burn from sun rays
So I just meditate at the home in Pompei
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Everytime I'm in Vegas they screaming like he Elvis
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real, got me feeling Israelian

Like Bar Refaeli, Gisele, nah that's Brazilian
Went through, deep depression when my momma passed
Suicide, what kinda talk is that
But I been talking to God for so long
And if you look at my life I guess he's talking back
Fucking with my clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my muthafuckin
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad bitches, man, they want the
They want the, they want the, they want the
