I remember me, starting at myself
See these same two eyes, see these same two feet
I remember you, You who I used to be
You still look the same, but you don't hurt like me
Look at my reflection, somewhere my affection
Disappeared, isn't here, nothing left to say
Memories they fading, but I'm the one who makes them
But i keep the love close to enough to say

What if this life is all that we're given
We just can't stop living, scared of what we see
Cuz in this world, anything can hurt you
They push you, then forget you
Stole my history

But I remember me, I remember me
It don't matter where I go, what I'm told, now you know
I remember me, I remember me
Even if I say goodbye, start to cry, do or die
I remember me, I remember me oh, whoa

...
I tell you what my name is
And ain't nothing gon' change it
Cuz what you are is what you are
Even if your memory's flawed
I go to places, trying to find familiar faces
They don't show, but I still know
They don't have to look for me
I dream about, I dream about

The place where all the broken pieces fit together
Cuz in this world, anything can hurt you
They push you, then forget you

And stole my history
But I remember me, I remember me
It don't matter where I go, what I'm told, now you know
I remember me, I remember me
Even if I say goodbye, start to cry, do or die

I remember me
Now all that's left of these hands, this breathe
I've said goodbye to so many things that tears wont cry
And i take this pain, This joy, and rain
Cuz all that matters now is
In this life anything can hurt you
Push you, then forget you

Erase your history
...
But I remember me, I remember me
It don't matter where I go, what I'm told, now you know
I remember me, I remember me
Even if I say goodbye, start to cry, do or die
I remember me
I remember me, oh woah
I remember me, I tell you what my name
I tell you what me name is
Do or die
