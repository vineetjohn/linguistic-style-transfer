Settle back now and raise a toast
To the young ones, growing old
All the green lights, long nights
Drinking 'til I made out with you

Just sit back, enjoy the show
It's the weekend, no place to go
You're the cherry, I'm a cigarette
Chasing after midnight with you

Don't shut me down now
Just hear me out now

Don't you go and carry on with your life
It was a one night stand 'til I woke up next to you
Don't you go, saying all your goodbyes
I want a one night stand just one more time with you
So give me one more night with you
Give me one more night with you

So take a breath now, you don't have to go
It was a fast night, we can take it slow
There were fist fights, red lights
Running 'til I crashed into you

I got my ass kicked, but you held the ice
I was a train wreck, but you took the ride
Can we stay here, right here?
Nothing else that I wanna do

Don't shut me down now
Just hear me out now

Don't you go and carry on with your life
It was a one night stand 'til I woke up next to you
Don't you go, saying all your goodbyes
I want a one night stand just one more time with you
So give me one more night with you

You say I've pushed my luck
But I can't get enough
If it was just a one time thing
Why are you still here with me?
Don't want a single thing to change
We can mess around for two more days
If it was just a one time thing
Why are you still here with me?
I don't want you to leave

Don't you go and carry on with your life
It was a one night stand 'til I woke up next to you
Don't you go, saying all your goodbyes
I want a one night stand just one more time with you
So give me one more night with you
You say I've pushed my luck
But I can't get enough
If it was just a one time thing
Why are you still here with me?
Don't want a single thing to change
We can mess around for two more days
I want a one night stand just one more time with you
So give me one more night with you
