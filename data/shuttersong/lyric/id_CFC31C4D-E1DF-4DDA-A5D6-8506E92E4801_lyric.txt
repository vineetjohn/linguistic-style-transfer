It's Young Khalifa, man!
2 Chainz!
Money's the motivation, money's the conversation
You on vacation, we gettin' paid so
We on paycation, I did it for the fame
It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am
Yeah, it's the life I chose
Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed
And we got it cooking like a one eyed stove
You can catch me kissing my girl with both eyes closed
Perfecting my passion, thanks for asking
Couldn't slow down so we had to crash it

You used plastic, we 'bout cash
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass, yeah
I never feared death or dying

I only fear never trying

I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me, now
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with

Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with

This moment, we own it
And the same ones that I ride with, be the same ones that I die with
Put it all out on the line with, if you looking for me you can find Wiz
In the new car or in the crown with, my new broad, that's a fine chick
And the wonder squad, I'm down with, ain't no way around it
What you say, tell me what you say?
Working hard, reppin' for my dogs, do this everyday
Takin' off, looking out for all, makin' sure we ball
Like the mob all you do is call
Catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa

I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am

Only God can judge me, now
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with (I ride or die for mine)

Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with (I ride or die for mine)
This moment, we own it (What we got?)
This the biggest day of my life, we got big guns been graduated from knives

It's the day in the life and I'm ready to ride, got the spirit I'm feelin' like a killer inside oh!
Financial outbreak, I'm free but I ain't out yet
Ridin' with the plug so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin' off set

I look better on your girl than her outfit
Stuck to the plan, always think that we would stand up, never ran
We the fame and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin' out on anybody who try to say some one thing about it, got a problem, I got the same one

Money rolls, we fold
Plently clubs we closed
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs, our cars don't even lose control
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with (I ride or die for mine)
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with (I ride or die for mine)
This moment, we own it
This moment, we own it
I ride or die for mine
I'm proud to die, material
One life could live, so here we go
This moment, we own it
