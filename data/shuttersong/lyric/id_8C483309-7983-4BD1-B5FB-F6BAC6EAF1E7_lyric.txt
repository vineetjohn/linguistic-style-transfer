So many girls in here, where do I begin?
I seen this one, I'm 'bout to go in
Then she said, "I'm here with my friends"
She got me thinking, and that's when I said

Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
So go get them, we can all be friends

Hey, bring it on, baby, all your friends
You're the shit, and I love that body, body
You wanna ball, let's mix it, I swear you're good
I won't tell nobody-body
You got a B.F.F., I wanna see that girl
It's all women invited

Hairdos and nails, that Louis, Chanel
All up in the body
Presidents in my wallet, no rules, I'm 'bout it
Blow the whistle for the hotties
I got it, shawty, it's never too much
Can't be doing too much

Ten to one of me, I can handle that love
Bottles in my reach, we can all get buzzed
Holla, 'cause I'm free till whenever, it's no rush

So many boys in here, where do I begin?
I seen this one, I'm 'bout to go in
Then he said, "I'm here with my friends"
He got to thinking, and that's when he said

Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
So go get them, we can all be friends

Peebe, peebee, who's Peabo Bryson?
Two years ago I renewed my license
Anyway, why'd I start my verse like that?
You can suck a dick
Or you can suck on a ballsack

No, no, I don't endorse that
P-p-p-pause that, a-a-a-abort that
Just the other day mi go a London, saw dat
Kids down Hyde Street, paparazzi, all that
Hey, hey, what can I say?
Day, d-d-day, d-day, d-day, day

Coming through the club
All the girls in the back of me
This ain't football
Why the fuck they tryna tackle me?
Really, I peep dude at the bar like really
Looking like he wanna good time like really
Said he had a friend for my home girl
Lilly, Lilly, Lilly, Lilly
