I Promise that one day I'll be around
I'll keep you safe, I'll keep you sound
Right now it's very crazy

And I don't know how to stop or slow it down
Hey

I know there are some things we need to talk about
And I can't stay

So let me hold you for a little longer now
Take a piece of my heart

And make it all your own
So when we are apart
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone

When you miss me close your eyes
I may be far but never gone
When you fall asleep tonight just remember that we lay under the same stars

And hey I know there are some things we need to talk about

And I can't stay
So let me hold you for a little longer now

And take a piece of my heart
And make it all your own
So when we are apart
You'll never be alone x6
And take a piece of my heart
And make it all your own
So when we are apart
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone.
