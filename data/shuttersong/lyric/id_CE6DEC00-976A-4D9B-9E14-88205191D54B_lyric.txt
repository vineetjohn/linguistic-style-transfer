It's Iggy Iggz
I got one more problem with you girl
One less, one less problem


Hey baby, even though I hate ya
I wanna love ya, I want you
And even though I can't forgive ya
I really want to, I want you
Tell me, tell me, babe
Why can't you leave me?
Cause even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it, I want you

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up, but it's you
I know I shouldn't ever call back
Or let you come back, but it's you
Every time you touch me
And say you love me
I get a little bit breathless
I shouldn't want it, but it's you

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

It's Iggy Iggz
What you got?
Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you
You sayin' that you know, but I really, really doubt you
Understand my life is easy
When I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you
More than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back
I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin'
Either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin'
I can't believe what you're sayin'
There's a million you's baby boo
So don't be dumb
I got 99 problems but you won't be one
Like what!

One less, one less problem
One less, one less problem
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders

I should be wiser
And realize that I've got
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
