Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na

He takes your hand
I die a little
I watch your eyes
And I'm in riddles
Why can't you look at me like that?

Na, na, na, na, na

When you walk by
I try to say it
But then I freeze
And never do it
My tongue gets tied
The words gets trapped

I hear the beat of my heart get louder
Whenever I'm near you

But I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart
'Cause you don't see

Whenever you kiss him
I'm breaking
Oh, how I wish that it was me

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na

He looks at you
The way that I would
Does all the things
I know that I could
If only time could just turn back

'Cause I got three little words
That I've always been dying to tell you

But I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart
'Cause you don't see

Whenever you kiss him
I'm breaking
Oh, how I wish that it was me

With my hands on your waist
While we dance in the moonlight
I wish it was me that you'll call later on
'Cause you wanna say goodnight

'Cause I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart cos you don't see

But I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart
'Cause you don't see

Whenever you kiss him
I'm breaking
Oh, how I wish
Oh, how I wish
Oh, how I wish
That was me, me, me
Oh, how I wish that was me
