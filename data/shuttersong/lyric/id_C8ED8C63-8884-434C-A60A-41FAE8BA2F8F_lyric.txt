Hope when you take that jump
You don't fear the fall
Hope when the water rises
You built a wall

Hope when the crowd screams out
It's screaming your name
Hope if
You choose to stay

Hope that you fall in love
And it hurts so bad
The only way you can know
You give it all you have

And I hope that you don't suffer
But take the pain
Hope when the moment comes, you'll say

I... I did it all
I... I did it all
I owned every second that this world could give
I saw so many places
The things that I did
Yeah, with every broken bone
I swear I lived

Hope that you spend your days
But they all add up
And when that sun goes down
Hope you raise your cup
Oh, oh

I wish that I could witness
All your joy
And all your pain
But until my moment comes
I'll say

I... I did it all
I... I did it all
I owned every second that this world could give
I saw so many places
The things that I did
Yeah with every broken bone
I swear I lived

Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh

With every broken bone
I swear I lived
With every broken bone
I swear I

I... I did it all
I... I did it all
I owned every second that this world could give
I saw so many places
The things that I did
Yeah with every broken bone
I swear I lived
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh
I swear I lived
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh
