Down in the waves
She screams again
Roar at the door
My mind can¡¯t take much more
I could never drown in

They wanna get my¡­
They wanna get my
Gold on the ceiling
I ain¡¯t blind
Just a matter of time
Before you steal it
It¡¯s alright
Ain¡¯t no guard in my house

Clouds covered love's
Barb-wired snare
Strung up, strung out
I just can¡¯t go without
I could never drown in

They wanna get my¡­
They wanna get my
Gold on the ceiling
I ain¡¯t blind
Just a matter of time
Before you steal it
It¡¯s alright
Ain¡¯t no guard in my house

They wanna get my¡­
They wanna get my
Gold on the ceiling
I ain¡¯t blind
Just a matter of time
Before you steal it
It¡¯s alright
Ain¡¯t no guard in my house
