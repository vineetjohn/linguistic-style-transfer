Please, don't see
Just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
Please, see me
Reaching out for someone I can't see

Take my hand,
Let's see where we wake up tomorrow
Best laid plans
Sometimes are just a one night stand
I'll be damned
Cupid's demanding back his arrow
So let's get drunk on our tears

And, God, tell us the reason
Youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars
Trying to light up the dark?

Who are we?
Just a speck of dust within the galaxy
Who is me
If we're not careful turns into reality

Don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
Turn the page
Maybe we'll find a brand new ending
We're dancing in our tears

And, God, tell us the reason
Youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars
Trying to light up the dark?

I thought I saw you out there crying
I thought I heard you call my name
I thought I heard you out there crying
Just the same

God, give us the reason
Youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars
Trying to light up the dark?

I thought I saw you out there crying
I thought I heard you call my name
I thought I heard you out there crying
But are we all lost stars
Trying to light up the dark?

But are we all lost stars
Trying to light up the dark?
