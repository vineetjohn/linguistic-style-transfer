Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love of fear

In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, and different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons and darling they all look like me

Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, this train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, for the life of us we can't get back

A beautiful magic love affair
What a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful
What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
