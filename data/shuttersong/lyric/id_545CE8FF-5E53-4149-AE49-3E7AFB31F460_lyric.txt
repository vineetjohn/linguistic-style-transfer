Do you remember when you told me that
I'll never be good enough for anyone
That I wasn't worth your time your energy
And why did I listen then
Why didn't I stand up for myself
You made me believe
That I was on the road to nowhere to nowhere

And oh I was listenin for way too long
Should've known I'm way too strong
To let you just lead me on lead me on
And oh I was drivin on that road too long
Just tryna find my way back home
The old me's dead and gone dead and gone

Ohh oh waah

I been thinkin bout all that we been through
Every place that you and me went to
Thinkin back on stupid little memories
Thinkin bout the times that my heart felt empty wait
That was all the time cause we just weren't fine we fake it
A true friend stabs you in the front so tell me why my back is aching
You can't say you just joke
Hangman there's your rope
Dang what's a five letter word for you
Got picked up and you got beat at your game
Burn every bridge but you still see the smoke
Try to get across but you sank every boat
You can smoke every day of your life
But when I'm on the mic I'm a be more dope

And oh I was listenin for way too long
Should've known I'm way too strong
To let you just lead me on lead me on

So you can love me for who I am
Or hate me for who you think I am
But the old me is dead and gone
I'm over on now

Oh ooh woah hey
The old me's dead and gone dead and gone
Oh ooh
