The world is spinning fast tonight
You can hurt yourself tryin' to hold on
To what you used to be
I'm so glad the past is all gone?
Been out in the wild
Been out in the night
Been out of your mind
Do you live here or is this a vacation

Volcano, you don't wanna, you don't wanna know.
Volcano
Something in you must to blow
Volcano

You don't wanna, you don't wanna know
Your eyes were like landing lights
They used to be the clearest blue

Now you don't see so well
The future's gonna land on you
Been out in the wild
Been out in the night

Been out of your mind
Do you live here or is this a vacation
Volcano, you don't wanna, you don't wanna know.
Volcano

Something in you must to blow
Volcano
You're on a piece of ground above a volcano
You were alone
Now you're not alone
You were alone

But now
You are Rock'n'Roll
You and I are Rock'n'Roll
You are Rock'n'Roll
You and I are Rock'n'Roll
Volcano, you don't wanna, you don't wanna know.
Volcano
Something in you must to blow
Volcano
You don't wanna, you don't wanna know.
You're on a piece of ground above a volcano
