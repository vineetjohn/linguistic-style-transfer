Well my friend it seems we've come too far to disagree
My knees feel weak and I fell too fast
The tide is high but we swam in too deep
To catch your breath
you tear me apart piece by piece
You can take away all this mess And

I could never think anything less of you
‘Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me

You are all I have left
The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms
To spur this on
we left that room too long
You open wide and all the lies flow out
To eat you whole
But we both know that you're too cold

And she said ‘I can put away
all those lies And
show you there's no surprise in me'
Well still, you break me
You numb me

You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left
you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me

This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left
Exorcise these demons
But they keep talking to me
I am no believer

But I believe you will relieve me
I believe you will relieve me
And that's what's going on
‘Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left
you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left
you break me
You break me
You break me
You break me
