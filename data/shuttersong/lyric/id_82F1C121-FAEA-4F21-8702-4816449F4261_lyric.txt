Heroes (We Could Be) - Alesso Tove Lo

We could hide away in daylight
We go undercover  wait out the sun
Got a secret side in plain sight
Where the streets are empty  that's where we run
Everyday people do everyday things but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now  we are a different kind
We can do anything
We could be heroes
We could be heroes  me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes  me and you
We could be
Anybody's got the power
They don't see it cause they don't understand
Spin around and round for hours
You and me  we got the world in our hands
Everyday people do everyday things but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now  we are a different kind
We can do anything
We could be heroes
We could be heroes  me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes  me and you
We could be
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you   
We could be
All we're looking for is love and a little light
Love and a little light
(We could be)
All we're looking for is love and a little light
Love and a little light
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you   
We could be
