Hey hey baby you've been on my mind I knew you for a long time
But I've been thinking maybe that you should know (oh oh yeah eh uh)
Hey hey baby can we compromise I really want you to be mine
I've got a million places that we could go (oh, oh yeah uh)

I wanna be your everything,
I wanna be the one you need

So tell me where ya been all my life,
Gonna make you mine tonight

Hey baby you, you got what I need
But you say you're just a friend
Yeah you say you're just a friend

Hey hey baby we've been on the phone
Spending time together alone,
But every time we talk the words don't come out right
(Oh oh, yeah eh uh)

Hey hey baby when I look in your eyes
I can tell you're holding something inside
I've been thinking bout you
I've been thinking bout me

I wanna be your everything,
I wanna be the one you need

So tell me where ya been all my life,
Gonna make you mine tonight

Hey baby you, you got what I need
But you say you're just a friend
Yeah you say you're just a friend

In carol city spent most of my nights,
Tryna make the world whistle
It's a hell of a life
How I made them all get low
Bring it back right around
Let the good times roll feeling good right now
But I remember Biz Markie
1989 or maybe 90,
Came to me like a song I wrote,
Cutting class
Chasing you 'cause you're all I want
Like you, you got what I need,
And if not I'll just pretend
Until I can get your friend
I'm playing though
But maybe there's a little truth sprinkle in 'em,
We be catching eyes and I can see the twinkle in 'em
Thought we'd be together until I seen the wrinkle in 'em
But I guess not

Hey baby you, you got what I need
But you say you're just a friend
Yeah you say you're just a friend.
