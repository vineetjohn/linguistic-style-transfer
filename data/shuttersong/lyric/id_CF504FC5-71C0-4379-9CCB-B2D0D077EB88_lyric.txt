When I was just a little kid, I was sitting on the garden wall
(Oh, get off the wall)
Well, I must've bumped my head cause I don't dance the same no more

(Oh, fell off the wall)

And now I step out of the crowd and I party on the other side
(Oh, the other side)

And ain't no uptight sucker gonna tell me how to live my life
(I'm living my life)
We're gonna get weird all night
I said now let's get weird all night

Weird people on the dance floor
We're just doing what we came to do
Cause we're all weird people and we love it
Don't let them other suckers hate on you
Cause we're all weird people and we're shaking

From the basement to the r-oo-oo-oo-f
You know the people on the bus and the people on the street
People like you and the people like me
Weird people

(Let's get weird)
I see a slick city boy with his fellas hanging by the bar

(Oh, get off the bar)
He got the money and the Benz but it don't mean a thing at all
(Oh, nothing at all)
Now, mister, let me tell you this, you can get a little weird for free
(Oh, get it for free)
Cause it don't matter who you are, you can be who you wanna be
(Oh, you wanna be)
We're gonna get weird all night

I said now let's get weird all night
Weird people on the dance floor
We're just doing what we came to do
Cause we're all weird people and we love it

Don't let them other suckers hate on you
Cause we're all weird people and we're shaking
From the basement to the roof
You know the people on the bus and the people on the street

People like you and the people like me
Well, there's something 'bout that boy
(There's something 'bout that girl)
There's something 'bout that boy
(There's something 'bout that girl)
I ain't doing nothing wrong, baby, I'm just feeling myself
I'm just gonna twerk it out like I ain't afraid for my health
We're gonna get weird all night
I said now let's get weird all night
We're gonna get weird all night
I said now let's get weird all night
Weird people on the dance floor
We're just doing what we came to do
Cause we're all weird people and we love it
Don't let them other suckers hate on you
Cause we're all weird people and we're shaking
From the basement to the roof
You know the people on the bus and the people on the street
People like you and the people like me
Weird People
