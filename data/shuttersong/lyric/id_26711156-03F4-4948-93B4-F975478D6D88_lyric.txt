There's nothing left here to worry about
We're on the ground
We're in the clouds
The world is spinning around

There is nothing left here worry about
We are on the ground
We float on the water
Or up in the clouds
Alone through the clouds
Alone on the ground
Alone on the water
Alone in the clouds
Alone through the clouds
Alone in the water
Alone on the ground

We were born to be alone
Everybody all alone
Born alone to be alone
We'll stand alone forever
Standing on the world alone
Learning how to stand alone
And always to be alone
We'll be alone forever

We were born to be alone
Everybody all alone
Born alone to be alone
We'll stand alone forever
Standing on the world alone
Learning how to stand alone
And always to be alone
We'll be alone forever

We were born to be alone
Everybody all alone
Born alone to be alone
We'll stand alone forever
Standing on the world alone
Learning how to stand alone
And always to be alone
We'll be alone forever

There's nothing left here to worry about
We're on the ground
We're in the clouds
The world is spinning around

There's nothing left here worry about
We are on the ground
We float on the water
Or up in the clouds

Everybody all alone
Born alone to be alone
We'll stand alone forever
Standing on the world alone
Learning how to stand alone
And always to be alone
We'll be alone forever

We were born to be alone
Everybody all alone
Born alone to be alone
We'll stand alone forever
Standing on the world alone
