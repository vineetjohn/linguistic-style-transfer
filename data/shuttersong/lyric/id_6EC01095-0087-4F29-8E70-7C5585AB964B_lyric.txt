We're stayin all night
Got blue jean baby playing in my mind
She gets me so high
Givin me faith I gotta testify
Uh
And the way that she walks I cant hide it
If I said I don't like it I'm lyin
Hold tight (yeah)
A little bit of love will change your life
She said I'm outta my head I'm going outta my mind
And when I'm out on the edge will you save me
Save me
Can we live for the moment
Can you live for tonight
Can we forget what was broken an say say say we'll be
All right
Cause even if we change we'll always be the same
All Night
I promise if you stay we'll never fade away
All Night
And now its midnight
and I can feel your electricity
(mmm)
Give me that skin tight
Good girls aint ever makin history
(Nope)
And we'll dance in the streets till the morning
Never sleep when the city is callin
Hold tight
A. little bit of love will change your life
(change your life)
She said I'm outta my head I'm going outta my mind
And when I'm out on the edge will you save me
Save me
Can we live for the moment
Can we live for tonight
Can we forget what was broken and say say say we'll be
All right
Cause even if we change we'll always be the same
All night
I promise if you stay we'll never fade away
All night
'We'll be all right'
'We'll be all right'
'We'll be all right'
'We'll be all right'
And we got nothing but time
(we'll be all right)
To make the most of this life
(we'll be all right)
Take on the wrongs and the rights
(we'll be all right)
Forget them all and just say say say
ohh wont you say it now
We'll be all right
All right
Cause even if we change we'll always be the same
All night
I promise if you stay we'll never fade away
All right
Cause even if we change we'll always be the same
All Night
I promise if you stay we'll never fade away
All Night
All Night
