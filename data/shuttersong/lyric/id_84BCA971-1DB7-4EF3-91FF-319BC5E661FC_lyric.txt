Manage me
I'm a mess
Turn a page
I'm a book half-unread
I want to be laughed at

Laughed with just because
I want to feel weightless
And that should be enough
But I'm stuck in this fucking run
Waiting on a secondhand pick-me-up
And I'm over

Getting older
If I could just find the time
Then I would never let another day go by
I'm over
Getting old
And maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I'm so sick of

Watching while the minutes pass
As I go nowhere
And this is my reaction
To everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy
I don't want to

Waste another minute
Here
Make believe

That I impress
That every word
By design
Turns a head
I wanna feel reckless
Wanna live it up
Just because
I wanna feel weightless

'Cause that would be enough
If I could just find the time
Then I would never let another day go by
I'm over

Getting old
And maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I'm so sick of

Watching while the minutes pass
As I go nowhere
And this is my reaction
To everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy
I don't want to
Waste another minute
Here
This could be all I've waited for
(I've waited, I've waited for)
And this could be everything
I don't wanna dream anymore
Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I've been going crazy
I'm stuck in here
And maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I'm so sick of
Watching while the minutes pass
As I go nowhere
And this is my reaction
To everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy
I don't want to
Waste another minute
