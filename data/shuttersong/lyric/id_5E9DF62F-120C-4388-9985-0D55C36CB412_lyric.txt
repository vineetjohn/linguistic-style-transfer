Shine - Years & Years
I remember us alone
Waiting or the light to go
Don't you feel that hunger
I've got so many secrets to show
When I saw you on that stage
I shiver with the look you gave
Don't you hear that rhythm
Can you show me how we can escape
I was biding my time
I was trying to hide
I'll forget what I've done
I will be redefined
It's shaking the sky and I'm following lightning
And I'll recover if you keep me alive
Don't leave me behind can you see me I'm shining
And It's you that I've been waiting to find
I'm holding it all tonight
I'm folding it all tonight
You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've been waiting to find
I'm holding it all tonight
I'm folding it all tonight
You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've been waiting to find
Now that we can hear that sound
I know that you can hold me down
You can't pull me under
You can raise everything to the ground
Everything I can arrange
And every part of me you change
Just hold me together
Tell me you'll always want me to stay
I was biding my time
I was trying to hide
I'll forget what I've done
I will be redefined
It's shaking the sky and I'm following lightning
And I'll recover if you keep me alive
Don't leave me behind can you see me I'm shining
And It's you that I've been waiting to find
I wanna be the one you steal
I wanna be the one you shield
I wanna be the one
That your love that your love can heal
I wanna be the one you steal
I wanna be the one you shield
I wanna be the one
That your love that your love
It's shaking the sky and I'm following lightning
And I'll recover if you keep me alive
Don't leave me behind can you see me I'm shining
And It's you that I've been waiting to find
I'm holding it all tonight
I'm folding it all tonight
You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've been waiting to find
I'm holding it all tonight
I'm folding it all tonight
You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've been waiting to find
It's you that I've been waiting to find
It's you that I've been waiting to find
