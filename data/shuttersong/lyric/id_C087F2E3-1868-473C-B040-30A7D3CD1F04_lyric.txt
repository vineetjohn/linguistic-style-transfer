Is it crazy that I want you to stay
When I tell you to leave
When I tell you go
Is it crazy that I say your name
More times a day
Than I say my own
Tell me baby is it crazy?
Tell me baby is it crazy?

Is it crazy when you're gone for a minute
I'm missing you, Yeah I feel alone
Is it crazy that I'm jealous of them bitches
When they get your time
And I know its wrong
But tell me is it crazy?
Yeah, I need to know if it's crazy
Damn

Cuz I ain't been myself
Lately somethings going on
Nah boy I ain't even slept
I been up all night long
In my head
Trying to figure out what I want what I do
What I don't

Is it crazy all them answers is You
Tell me cuz its blowing my mind
Tell me cuz I don't understand
How someone just can walk into your life
And everything before them you forget

Is it crazy?
Tell me what's going on
I need to know
Cuz I ain't tryna lose myself
Or lose control
Baby tell me the truth
I need to know
Is it crazy?
Baby is it crazy?

Is it crazy that I told my ex don't call no more cuz I'm in love?
Is it crazy that I keep your shirt right here just to smell your cologne?
Damn that sounds crazy
Tell me is it crazy

Cus I ain't been myself
Lately somethings going on
Nah boy I ain't even slept
I been up all night long
In my head
Trying to figure out what I want what I do
What I don't

Is it crazy all them answers is You
Tell me cuz its blowing my mind
Tell me cus I don't understand
How someone just can walk into your life
And everything before them you forget
