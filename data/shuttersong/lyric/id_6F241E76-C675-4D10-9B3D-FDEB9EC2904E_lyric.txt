You sent a text
It's like the wind changed your mind
We were best friends
Yeah, we were building our lives
With every kiss, and every letter
Every promise of forever
Oh, but you hit send
And disappeared in front of my eyes

And now you're just a ghost
(When I look back never would have known that)
You could be so cold
(Like a stranger vanish like a vapor)
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20
I see through you now

Something is tight
Now that I have made up my mind
I'll be alright
It doesn't harm me at night
Cause every gift, every letter, every promise of forever
Now, it's out of sight
Like you were never alive

And now you're just a ghost
(When I look back never would have known that)
You could be so cold
(Like a stranger vanish like a vapor)
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20
I see through you now

Now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now
So rest in peace
I'll see you on the other side

And now you're just a ghost
(When I look back never would have known that)
You could be so cold
(Like a stranger vanish like a vapor)
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20
I see through you now
Now, now, now, now
I see through you now
Now, now, now, now
I see through you now
