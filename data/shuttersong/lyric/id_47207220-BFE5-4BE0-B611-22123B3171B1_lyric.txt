Paper bags and plastic hearts
All our belongings in shopping carts
It's goodbye, but we got one more night
Let's get drunk and ride around
And make peace with an empty town
We can make it right

Throw it away, forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
And we won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn, let it die
'Cause we are finally free, tonight

Tonight will change our lives
It's so good to be by your side
We'll cry, we won't give up the fight
We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs
And they'll think it's just 'cause we're young
But we'll feel so alive

Throw it away, forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
And we won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn, let it die
'Cause we are finally free, tonight

All of the wasted time, the
Hours that we've left behind, the
Answers that we'll never find
They don't mean a thing tonight

Throw it away, forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
We won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway

Throw it away, forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
And we won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Throw it away, forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
And we won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn, let it die
'Cause we are finally free, tonight
