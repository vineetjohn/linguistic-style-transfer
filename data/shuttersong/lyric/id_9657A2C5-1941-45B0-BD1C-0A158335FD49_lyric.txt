What is life? Life is a spell
What is life? No one can tell
What is life? I try to see
What is life? It's looking bleak

They control the treasure of our birthright
And to survive we have to struggle and fight
The present confrontation of our mind
The flexibility of our vision

What is life? I try to see
What is life? It's unity
What is life? I try to feel
What is life? It's really real

Everyone say they are not excited
While our vineyard exploited
African woman hold me close to you
Help me to find don't get separated

What is life? Life is a treat
What is life? Nothing but cheat
What is life? Life is a test
What is life? Some man Jah bless

They control the pleasure of our birthright
And to survive we have to struggle and fight
The present confrontation of our mind
The flexibility of our vision

What is life? I try to see
What is life? It's unity
What is life? Life is a dream
What is life? Life is a treat

What is life? Life is a spell
What is life? No one can tell
What is life? I try to see
What is life? It's looking so bleak

What is life?
What is life?
What is life?
What is life?
What is life? Life is a treat
