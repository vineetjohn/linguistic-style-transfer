Hey
(I want a soldier)
The way you got it, I'm the hottest around
They'll know it when they see you rollin' Impala's around
(I got a soldier)
With the top down, feeling the sounds

Quakin' and vibratin' your thighs, ridin' harder than guys
With the chrome wheels at the bottom, white leather inside
When them lames be spittin' at you tell 'em don't even try it
To shoot it with Chelle and kick it with Kelly or holla at B
Ya, gotta be G's you way outta your league, please

A rude boy that's good to me, with street credibility

If his status ain't hood I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier that ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things if you know what I mean

If his status ain't hood I ain't checkin' for him

Gotta know to get dough and he better be street

Low cut caesars with the deep waves
(Deep waves)

(Beyonce)
Always comin' down poppin' our way
(Our way)

You talkin' to the sergeant
Body marked up like the subway in Harlem

Call him, Weezy F. Baby, please say the Baby
If you don't see me on the block I ain't tryin' to hide
I blend in with the hood, I'm camouflage
Bandanna tied, so mommy join my troop
Now every time she hear my name she salute

I like them boys over there, they lookin' strong tonight
