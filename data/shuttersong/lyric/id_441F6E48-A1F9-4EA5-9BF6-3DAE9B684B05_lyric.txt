t's the most wonderful time of the year
With the kids jingle-belling
And everyone telling you be of good cheer
It's the most wonderful time of the year

It's the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings
When friend come to call
It's the hap-happiest season of all

There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And carolling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost story
And tales of glories of Christmas long, long ago

It's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be much mistletoe-ing and hearts will be glowing
When love ones are near
It's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be much mistletoe-ing and hearts will be glowing
When love ones are near
It's the most wonderful time
It's the most wonderful time
It's the most wonderful time of the year
