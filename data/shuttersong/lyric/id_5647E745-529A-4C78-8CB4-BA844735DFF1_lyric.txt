Will I see you again when I'm lost in the dark?
Will you be there for me when I look at the stars?

I drove by your house the other day
I saw your mom packing up all your stuff in boxes
She misses you, but I know she'll be okay
She's staying strong, I guess that's all part of the process
Your dad's a mess and I cry every time I see him
Cause it reminds me of my dad, I couldn't imagine it
That matching tattoo that you got with him a while back?
He shows it off to everybody, he's so proud of it
And he's so proud of you, I know you're happy now
I know you're up there, every day I feel you shining down
But now the only thing that's running through my head
Are all the words that I wish I would've said

Yeah, I wish I would've said
Now the only thing that's running through my head
Are all the words that I wish I would've said

You're my fallen angel
Why'd you go away?
You're my fallen angel
But I'll see you again someday
And we will fly high, oh
Together

We call you sunshine cause you were always such a ray of light
I looked up to you and admired your outlook on life
Remember that song we made together back in 12th grade?
I pray to God that I rap again with you someday
I wish you could see all of the people you've touched
God, everything is different now, we miss you so much
I'll never forget you, you'll always be in my heart

When I'm lost, you'll be the light that I look to in the dark
Cause the sun don't rise without sunshine
Don't worry 'bout us, we'll be just fine
No, the sun don't rise without sunshine

Don't worry 'bout us, we'll be just fine
You're my fallen angel
Why'd you go away?
You're my fallen angel
And we'll see you again someday
And we will fly high, oh
yeah, fly high, oh
You're my fallen angel
Why'd you go away?
You're my fallen angel
But I'll see you again someday
And we will fly high, oh
Together
Will I see you again when I'm lost in the dark?
Will you be there for me when I look at the stars?
Will I see you again when I'm lost in the dark?
Will you be there for me when I look at the stars?
