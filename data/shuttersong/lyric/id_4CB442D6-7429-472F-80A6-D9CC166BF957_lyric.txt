Blind faith
Heartache
Mind games
Mistakes
My sweet fireball
My sweet rigmarole
I want it all
I want it all

Old dogs
New tricks
Can you feel it?
Space age country girl
Stone cold miracle
I want it all
I want it all

And then suddenly it hit me it's a year ago
Since I drank miniature whiskey and we shared your coke
Ain't it just like you to kiss me and then hit the road
Leave me listening to the stones
2000 light years from home

Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop

Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop

Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop

I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
