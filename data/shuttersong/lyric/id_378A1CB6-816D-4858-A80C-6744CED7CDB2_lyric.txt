Dear mother, can you hear me whinin'?
It's been three whole weeks since that I have left your home
This sudden fear has left me tremblin'

'Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own
And I'm feelin' so alone
Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland, I like to call my home
Welcome to Paradise
A gunshot rings out at the station
Another urchin snaps and left dead on his ground

It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason, it's now feelin' like my home
And I'm never gonna go
Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland, I like to call my home
Welcome to Paradise
Dear mother, can you hear me laughin'

It's been six whole months since that I have left your home
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason it's now feelin' like my home
And I'm never gonna go

Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland, I like to call my home
Welcome to Paradise, oh Paradise
