And when it rains
On this side of town it touches everything
Just say it again and mean it
We don't miss a thing
You made yourself a bed
At the bottom of the blackest hole
And convinced yourself that it's not the reason
You don't see the sun anymore

And oh, oh, how could you do it?
Oh I, I never saw it coming
Oh, oh, I need an ending
So why can't you stay just long enough to explain?
And when it rains

You always find an escape
Just running away
From all of the ones who love you
From everything
You made yourself a bed
At the bottom of the blackest hole
And you'll sleep 'til May and you'll say
That you don't want to see the sun anymore
And oh, oh, how could you do it?

Oh I, I never saw it coming
Oh, oh, I need an ending
So why can't you stay just long enough to explain?
Take your time
Take my time

Take these chances to turn it around
Just take these chances, we'll make it somehow

And take these chances to turn it around
Just turn it around
And oh, how could you do it?
Oh I, I never saw it coming

Oh, oh, how could you do it?
Oh I, I never saw it coming
Oh, oh, how could you do it?
Oh I, I never saw it coming
Oh, oh I need an ending
So why can't you stay just long enough to explain?
You can take your time
Take my time
