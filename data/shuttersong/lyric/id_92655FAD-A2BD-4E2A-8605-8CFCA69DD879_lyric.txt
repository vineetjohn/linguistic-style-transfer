Greeting cards have all been sent
The Christmas rush is through
But I still have one wish to make
A special one for you:

Merry Christmas darling
We're apart, that's true
But I can dream, and in my dreams
I'm Christmas-ing with you
Holidays are joyful
There's always something new
But every day's a holiday
When I'm near to you

Oh, the lights on my tree
I wish you could see
I wish it every day
The logs on the fire
Fill me with desire
To see you and to say...
That I wish you Merry Christmas
Happy New Year, too

I've just one wish on this Christmas Eve
I wish I were with you
Oh, ooh...

Oh, the logs on the fire
Fill me with desire
To see you and to say...
That I wish you Merry Christmas
Happy New Year, too
I've just one wish on this Christmas Eve
I wish I were with you
I wish I were with you
Merry Christmas, darling
