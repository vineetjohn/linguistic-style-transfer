Mind over matter
Does it matter to any of us?
Don't change the subject
I'm heavy on your love
I missed that train
New York City: it rains!
Fly to East L.A. in big jet planes
You know you're on my mind
And if the world don't break
I'll be shaking it
Cuz I'm a young man after all!
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
Cuz I'm a young man built to fall!

Mind over matter
I'm in tatters thinking about her
Taste my disaster
It's heavy on my tongue
All the lights aglow
Tokyo: snows
Go to watch the show
Curtain's closed
I'm watching you this time
And if the world don't break
I'll be shaking it
Cuz I'm a young man after all!
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?

Cuz I'm a young man built to fall!

I missed that train
New York City: it rains!
Fly to East L.A. in big jet planes
You know you're on my mind
All the lights aglow
Tokyo: snows
Go to watch the show; curtain's closed
I'm watching you this time
Mind over matter
Mind over matter
You know you're on my mind!
And if the world don't break

I'll be shaking it
Cuz I'm a young man after all!

And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
Cuz I'm a young man built to fall!
And if the world don't break! (All the lights aglow)
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
Cuz I'm a young man built to fall!
