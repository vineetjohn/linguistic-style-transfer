So what if I just wanna be a little bit out of my mind
I let you take my heart and I like it
So what if I happen to be
A little bit out of my mind
I better steal your heart and you'll like it
And I don't think it's any kind of secret
I feel you from a million miles away
Your love is the best thing that I got
And it's only just begun
But it's never gonna stop
The best thing, the best thing that I got
I know sometimes
It seems like I
Am just a little bit behind
I get back on the beat and you know it
And sometimes I can tell that I am just a little out of time
I make you skip a beat and I know it
But I don't think it's any kind of secret
I think of you a billion times a day
Your love is the best thing that I got
And it's only just begun
But it's never gonna stop
It's the best thing, the best thing that I got
So don't feel lonely tonight you know I'll never be hard to find
So don't go out of your mind
You know I'll never be too hard to find
I know sometimes
It seems like I
Am just a little bit behind
I get back on the beat and you know it
Your love is the best thing that I got
And it's only just begun
But it's never gonna stop
It's the best thing, the best thing that I got
Your love is the best thing
And it's only just begun
It's the best thing
