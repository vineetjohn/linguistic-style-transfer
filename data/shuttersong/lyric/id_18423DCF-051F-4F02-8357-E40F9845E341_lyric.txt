Road trippin' with my two favorite allies
Fully loaded we got snacks and supplies
It's time to leave this town  it's time to steal away
Let's go get lost  anywhere in the U S A 
Let's go get lost
Let's go get lost
Blue you sit so pretty
West of the one
Sparkles light with yellow icing
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
So much as come before those battles lost and won
This life is shining more forever in the sun
Now let us check our heads and let us check the surf
Staying high and drys more trouble
Than it's worth in the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
In Big Sur we take some time to linger on
We three hunky dory's got our snake finger on
Now let us drink the stars  it's time to steal away
Let's go  get lost  right here in the U S A
Let's go  get lost
Let's go  get lost
Blue you sit so pretty
West of the one
Sparkles light with yellow icing
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
Your smiling eyes are just a mirror for
