Iggy Iggy, gettin' 'em tipsy
Tippin' em broads, hundreds and fifties
Pullin' up, NASCAR, black car
Shittin' on everyone, sippin' whatever we feelin'
Real real good, hands to the ceiling

Dancin' we dizzy, we spinnin' we spinnin'
All about money, the night's never ending
We party till morning, tomorrow we kick it

Bounce, make it, make it bounce
Bounce, make it, make it bounce
Bounce, make it, make it bounce
Shake it, break it, make it bounce
Bounce, make it bounce
Bounce, make it bounce
Bounce, make it bounce
Shake it, break it, make it bounce

Let ya hair down and shake that shit, shake that shit, shake that shit
Sweat it out, go nuts in this bitch
Dip it, spin it, and watchin' my hips
I see you watchin' my hips
Crazy, move your body like Swayze

Round and round, shake it, break it, make it bounce
It's a fucking celebration, go-go-go
Girl shake 'em down like you made it, get low-low-low
Then show the good like you're wasted, po'-po'-po'
And spray the crowd with amazement, fo' sho-sho-sho

Go nuts, hands up, get crazy (we go)
Go nuts, hands up, get crazy (we go)
Go nuts, hands up, get crazy (we go)
Go nuts, hands up, get crazy
Make it bounce
Make it bounce
Make it bounce
Go nuts, hands up, get crazy
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Bounce, shake it, break it, make it bounce
