La La La La La La La

Swore I would never be that girl holding your hand
Look at you gazing
Acting like your biggest fan
I used to make fun
Of all the things that they said
Saying I will never be like that
But then you showed up
Like you have been there before
Was like you knew me
Had me with every word
You saw right through me
Melted me down to the core

I was done when you walked through that door

Well I don't know how you do it to me
You make my brain just stop
Sink my heart to my feet
It's like a rollercoaster

But I'm going up
I'm in crazy stupid love

So call me baby
In front of all your friends
It used to shake me
But would you say it again
It's a weird feeling
We're laying here in the dark
And I don't wanna fight this spark
You got me flying
Don't want to ever come down
I'm realizing
I kinda need you around

Hard to believe it
I'm that girl holding your hand
And I'm still trying to understand

Well I don't know how you do it to me
You make my brain just stop

Sink my heart to my feet
It's like a rollercoaster
But I'm going up
I'm in crazy stupid love

Whistle, I like it when you blow the whistle
You make me wanna ch!
Bank bank bank bank
Baby I don't own a pistol
My tongue wagging when you wiggle
I'll end up kissing you with or without the mistle
Love the open toes and the clothes
Even though we ain't official
You official, you official
When you see me in a suit
Say I'm so smooth criminal
Playing hard to get
Girl you're being too difficult
Let me in your mind
For I get the physical
I ain't tryna mess with any woman
That's typical, need original
Lips and eyes, big surprise
If she have hips and thighs

Kissed her twice
Now she say I'm Mr. Right
She had my D
Now she dickmatised
Woah lord

Well I don't know how you do it to me
You make my brain just stop
Sink my heart to my feet
It's like a rollercoaster
But I'm going up
I'm in crazy stupid love

La la la la
La la la la
I'm in crazy stupid love
La la la la
La la la la
Oh I'm in crazy stupid love
La la la la
La la la la
