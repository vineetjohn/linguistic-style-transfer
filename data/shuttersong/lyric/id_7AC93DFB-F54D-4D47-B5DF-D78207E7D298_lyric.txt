How do I get closer to you
When you keep it all on mute?
How will I know the right way to love you?

Usually the queen of figurin' out
Breaking down a man is no work out
But I have no clue
How to get through to you

Oh, I wanna hit you just to see if you cry
I keep knocking on wood
Hopin' there's a real boy inside

'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man

I wish I could just turn you on
Put a battery in and make you talk
Even pull a string for you to say anything

But with you there is no guarantee
Only expired warranty
A bunch of broken parts
And I can't seem to find your heart

Oh, I'm such a fool
I'm such a fool
I'm such a fool
This one's outta my hands
I can't put you back together again

'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man

You're just a toy
Could you ever be a real, real boy?
And understand?
But you're not a man

If the past is the problem
Our future could solve them, baby
I could bring you to life if you let me inside, baby
It'll hurt but in the end you'll be a man

You're not a man
You're just a manequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real

A toy
Could you ever be a real, real boy?
Understand?
But you are not a man

You are not a man
You're just a manequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man
