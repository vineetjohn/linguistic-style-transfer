Take ‘em back, take ‘em back
Take ‘em back, take ‘em back now

I take it back on some nostalgic shit, oh you whylin' bitch
Been doing this since before I was a college kid, let's go
Oh this shit remind me of, the summer time
The slip and slide, some bump and grind
Oh this shit remind me of the parking lot
And skipping class, and smoking pot
Oh this shit remind me of parties with the freshman
Second base on the couch, plus she gave me mouth to mouth
Oh this shit remind me of tryna make a fake I.D
Walked into the liquor store, but they ain't selling shit to me
Oh this shit remind me of riding with my crew
Water bottle full of booze, breaking in in people's pools
Oh this shit remind me of acting like a fool
We was seventeen and we thought it was cool

What you know about it?

And I know things ain't always gonna go your way

Cause we got shitty jobs and we got bills to pay

But I think that the future's looking fucking great
So get your hands up in the sky let's celebrate

Oh that shit remind me of
Remind me of, remind me of, remind me of
Oh that shit remind me of the good times
This shit remind me of the good times
Oh that shit remind me of
Remind me of, remind me of, remind me of

Oh that shit remind me of the good times
This shit remind me of the good times

Oh this shit remind me of being somber in the club
Hanging out with tons of girls and they just wanna do some drugs
Oh this shit remind me of fake handshakes and shoulder shrugs
Walking into every label, they pretend they gave a fuck
Said they love my music, think I'm special, and they wanna sign me
Then I leave, and they gon' say, the same damn thing to the three behind me
Oh this shit remind me of why I never sold my soul
Two thousand kids in my city they just wanna see me blow
Then I went across the country, saw two hundred thousand more
Oh this shit remind me of everything I wanted bro
So I won't ever be a rapper that you see complaining
If you want it, go and take it, step up, word to Channing Tatum
Damn I go so looney on these tunes, I should be animated
This is for my English teacher, way back when who always hated
Okay Mr. Davis, I won't rub it in your face
But you should turn like all of my grades from some B pluses into As
And I know things ain't always gonna go your way
Cause we got shitty jobs and we got bills to pay
But I think that the future's looking super bright
So let me see your hands up in the sky like one more time
Oh that shit remind me of
Remind me of, remind me of, remind me of
Oh that shit remind me of the good times
This shit remind me of the good times
Oh that shit remind me of
Remind me of, remind me of, remind me of
Oh that shit remind me of the good times
This shit remind me of the good times
Bring it down like
And you been rocking with the
The happy camper
Oh yeah
