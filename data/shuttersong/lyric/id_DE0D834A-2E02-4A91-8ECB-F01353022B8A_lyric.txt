"Say Love"

This is us at our best, and at our worst
And when we speak, does it feel unrehearsed?

Cause where I wanna be is far apart
From where we are, from where we are
And I thought I found the place where we could start
Talk from the heart, talk from the heart

But you just say I'm perfect
Say I'm pretty
Say I'm worth it
But if you really care for me

Say love
I want you to say love
I want you to say love
When I say "love you"
You just say "me too"
But I want you to say love

It feels like we can't get out of first
When we do it's like we're stuck in reverse, oh

Cause where I wanna be is far apart
From where we are, from where we are
And I thought I found the place where we could start
Talk from the heart, talk from the heart

But you just say I'm perfect
Say I'm pretty
Say I'm worth it
But if you really care for me

Say love
I want you to say love
I want you to say love
When I say "love you"
You just say "me too"
But I want you to say love

But you just say I'm perfect
Say I'm pretty
Say I'm worth it
But if you really care for me

Say love
I want you to say love
I want you to say love
When I say "love you"
You just say "me too"
But I want you to say love
