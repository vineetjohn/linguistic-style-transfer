Never thought that I would grow so old of seeing the gold 
Still I never want it to go 
I would hold it up to my cold heart 
Feel the way it used to start up 

Take me back to the way that I was before 
Hungry for what was to come 
Now I'm longing for the way I was 

You say you will, say you will save me 
You say you will, say you will save me 
You say you will, say you will save me 
You say you will, say you will! 

Take me back 
Give it up to me 
Cause i cant go on if your love isn't strong 
I want it all 
Give me all your love 
But if you can't hold on, 

Then baby, don't save me now 
If your love isn't strong, 
Don't save me now 

All my life I wasn't trying to get on a high way 
I was wondering which way to go 
Spending all of my damn time 
Leaving all the weight behind 
Take me back to the song, how'd it used to go? 
Screaming for what was to come, 
Now I'm dreaming back the way I was 

You say you will, say you will save me 
You say you will, say you will save me 
You say you will, say you will save me 
You say you will, say you will! 

Take me back 
Give it up to me 
Cause I cant go on if your love isn't strong 
I want it all 
Give me all your love 
But if you can't hold on, 

Then baby, don't save me now 
If your love isn't strong 
Don't save me now 

And if I had to beg for your love 
Would it ever be enough? 

So baby, don't save me 
Baby, don't save me
So baby, don't save me 
Baby, don't save me...
