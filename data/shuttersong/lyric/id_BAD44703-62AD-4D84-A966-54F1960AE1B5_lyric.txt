And Monte Keep it on him, he done dropped niggas
And Trigger he be wilding, he some hot nigga
Tones known to get busy with them Glocks, nigga
Try to run down and you can catch a shot, nigga
Running through these checks 'til I pass out
Your shorty gave me neck 'til I pass out
I swear to God, all I do is cash out
And if you ain't a hoe, get up out my trap house

Get that money back and spend it on the same thing

Grimey savage, that's what we are
Grimey shooters dressed in G-Star

But GS for my gun squad
And bitch if there's a problem we gon' gun brawl
Shots popping 'out The AR

Broad daylight and we gon' let them things bark
Tell them niggas free Meeshie, hoe
