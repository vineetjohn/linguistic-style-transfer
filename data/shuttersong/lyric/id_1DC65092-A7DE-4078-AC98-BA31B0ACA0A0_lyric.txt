There ain't no need to cry no more
When you break my heart into twenty four
I'll pick up the pieces you left
If you think I'm coming back, well, don't hold your breath
I ain't your mister, 'cause I'm breakin' up with ya
Shoulda' laid down with your sister
Go now, here's my middle finger

Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Must be stupid if you think that we can start again
Come on now!

Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Must be stupid if you think that we can start again
Are you joking, must be joking
You ain't laughin', I ain't smokin'
Must be crazy if you think that we can start again

There ain't no need to cry no more

Now I know that she wants me back
Nothing sounds more better than "Hit the road, Jack Jack"
