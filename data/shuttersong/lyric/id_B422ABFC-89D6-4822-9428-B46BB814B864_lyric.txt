I g-g-g-g-gotta say Honestly
When you look at me
It's like a gun goes off
Deep inside of me
I can hardly move
I can barely breathe
Near your features

The t-t-t-t-tadada-trouble is
It's just so obvious
I still see all the lines
Of surgery remnants
Where you cut away
left your flaws behind
In the ether

F-f-f-face of puzzle pieces
That don't fit together
Puzzle Pieces
That don't fit together

It's never right
But you just can't move on
You can't decide
Take away or put on
Your design
But you won't stop working
A masterpiece
In the flesh

It's
Your
Puzzle
It's your puzzle
It's yours

The d-d-d-d-dada-octor's hands
Carry out the plans
To take you all apart
And put you back again
Your face is canvas
And your own body serves
As your easle

It's just, It's just
It's just so hard to quit
When you're hooked on it
You're just a junkie craving
One more plastic fix
Keep you up to date
With all the latest trends
Of the seasons

F-f-f-face of puzzle pieces
That don't fit together

Puzzle Pieces
That don't fit together

It's never right
But you just can't move on
You can't decide
Take away or put on
Your design
But you won't stop working
A masterpiece
In the flesh

It's your puzzle

It's your puzzle

It's yours
