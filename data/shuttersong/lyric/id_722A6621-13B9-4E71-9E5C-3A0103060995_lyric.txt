Diana

The front pages are your pictures
They make you look so small
How could someone not miss you at all?

Oh-ah-oh

I never would mistreat ya
Oh I'm not a criminal
I speak a different language but I still hear your call.

Diana
Let me be the one to light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely
You don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana
Let me be the one to lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realize baby you'd be saving mine.

(Oh-oh)

Diana

It's only been four months but
You've fallen down so far.
How could someone mislead you at all?

Oh-ah-oh

I wanna reach out for you
I wanna break these walls
I speak a different language but I still hear you call.

Diana
Let me be the one to light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely
You don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana
Let me be the one to lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realize baby you'd be saving mine.

We all need something
This can't be over now
If I could hold you
Swear I'd never put you down

Let me be the one to light a fire inside those eyes

Oh-ah-oh

Oh-ah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Diana
Baby, you'd be saving mine
Oh-ah-oh
Diana
Oh-ah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Diana
Baby, you'd be saving mine
