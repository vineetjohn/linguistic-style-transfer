I'm here at the end, yeah, if I could go back to the start
I'd do it again, yeah, I'd live like never before
Now will you remember, remember me when I'm gone?
Remember the heat, yeah, that's keeping you warm?

Saying brighter, now we're burning up, light up
Yelling turn it up, let go, let go, let go

In paradise, the closer I get to you it feels like paradise
And I'd do anything you'd want me to when we're in paradise
I'll see you on the other side, where it's alright
If tonight is the last night, I'll see you in paradise
If tonight is the last night, I'll see you in paradise
If tonight is the last night, I'll see you in paradise

You better be ready cause all good things come to an end
Spring into summer, my fire's burning again

Saying brighter, I'm not giving up, light up
Gonna live it up, let go, let go, let go

In paradise, the closer I get to you it feels like paradise
And I'd do anything you'd want me to when we're in paradise
I'll see you on the other side, where it's alright
If tonight is the last night, I'll see you in paradise, paradise
If tonight is the last night, I'll see you in paradise, paradise, paradise
If tonight is the last night, I'll see you in paradise
