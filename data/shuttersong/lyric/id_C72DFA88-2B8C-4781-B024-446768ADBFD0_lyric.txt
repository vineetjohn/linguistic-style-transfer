Konvict, Konvict Muzik

And you know we upfront
I see you winding and grinding up on that pool
I know you see me lookin' at you when you already know I wanna fuck you
you already know I wanna fuck you

you already know, girl
Money in the air that's mo' fair, grab you by your coat tail
Take you to the motel, wholesale
Don't tell, won't tell, baby say I don't talk dog
But she told on me, oh well
Take a picture with me, what the flick gon' do?
Baby stick to me and I'ma stick on you
If you pick me then I'ma pick on you
D-O-double-G and I'm here to put this dick on you
I'm stuck on pussy and yours is right
Rip ride on those floors and those doors is tight

And I'ma get me a shot 'for the end of the night
'Cause pussy is pussy and baby you're pussy for life
I see you winding and grinding up on that pool
I know you see me lookin' at you when you already know I wanna fuck you

you already know I wanna fuck you
you already know, girl
Shorty I can see you ain't lonely
Handful of niggers and they all got G's
So you lookin' at me now what it's gonna be
Just another a tease far as I can see
Trying to get you up out this club
If it means spendin' a couple dubs

Throwin' about 30 stacks in the back make it rain like that
'Cause I'm far from a scrub
And you know my pedigree
Ex-deala used to move 'phetamines

Girl I spend money like it don't mean nothing
And besides I got a thing for you
I see you winding and grinding up on that pool
I know you see me lookin' at you when you already know I wanna fuck you
you already know I wanna fuck you
you already know, girl
Mobbin' through the club in the low pressin'
I'm sittin' in the back in the smoker section

Birds eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me but I can see you
It's cool we jet, the mood is set, your pussy is so wet
You're rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck
Your body is movin', you're humpin' and jumpin', your titties is bouncin'
You're smilin' and grinning and lookin' at me
Girl and while you lookin' at me, I'm ready to hit the catty
Right up on the patio, move the patty to the catty

Baby you got a fatty, the type I like to marry
Wanting to just give you everything and that's kinda scary
'Cause I'm lovin' the way you shake your ass
Bouncin' got me tippin' my glass

Normally don't get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you
I see you winding and grinding up on that pool
I know you see me lookin' at you when you already know I wanna fuck you
you already know I wanna fuck you
you already know
I see you winding and grinding up on that pool
I know you see me lookin' at you when you already know I wanna fuck you
you already know I wanna fuck you
you already know, girl
