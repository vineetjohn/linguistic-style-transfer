Cause you´re a sky
Cause you´re a sky full of stars
I´m going to give you my heart
Cause you´re a sky
Cause you´re a sky full of stars
And cause you light up the path

I don´t care
Go on and tear me apart
I don´t care if you do
Cause in a sky
Cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you

Cause you´re a sky
Cause you´re a sky full of stars
I want to die in your arms, arms
Cause you get lighter the more it gets darks
I´m going to give you my heart
And I don´t care
Go on and tear me apart
I don´t care if you do
Cause in a sky
Cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you
I think I see you

Because you´re a sky
You´re a sky full of stars
Such a heavenly view
It´s such a heavenly view
