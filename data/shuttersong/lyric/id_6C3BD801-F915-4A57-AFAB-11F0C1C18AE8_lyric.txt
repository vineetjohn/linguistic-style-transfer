Dropping the flame

A lot of niggas die, due to these streets
A lot of mama's cry, due to this beef

Who got that work? He got that work
She pop that pussy, she make it twerk
A couple model bitches, thought I balled for the Lakers
All they know is suck and fuck and speak a different language
She like that cocaina, she sniff it off my banger
She like to blow my nine, I think she's going brainless
Put in work, put 'em in the dirt

They pop a pill, then they pop a bullet
