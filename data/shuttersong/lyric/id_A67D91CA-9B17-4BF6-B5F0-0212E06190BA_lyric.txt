You can be amazing 
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug 
You can be the outcast 
Or be the backlash of somebody’s lack of love 
Or you can start speaking up 
Nothing’s gonna hurt you the way that words do 
And they settle ‘neath your skin 
Kept on the inside and no sunlight 
Sometimes a shadow wins 
But I wonder what would happen if you 

Say what you wanna say 
And let the words fall out 
Honestly I wanna see you be brave 

With what you want to say 
And let the words fall out 
Honestly I wanna see you be brave 

I just wanna see you 
I just wanna see you 
I just wanna see you 
I wanna see you be brave 

I just wanna see you 
I just wanna see you 
I just wanna see you 
I wanna see you be brave 

Everybody’s been there, everybody’s been stared down 
By the enemy 
Fallen for the fear and done some disappearing 
Bow down to the mighty 
Don’t run, stop holding your tongue 
Maybe there’s a way out of the cage where you live 
Maybe one of these days you can let the light in 
Show me how big your brave is 

Say what you wanna say 
And let the words fall out 
Honestly I wanna see you be brave 

With what you want to say 
And let the words fall out 
Honestly I wanna see you be brave 

Innocence, your history of silence 
Won’t do you any good 
Did you think it would? 
Let your words be anything but empty 
Why don’t you tell them the truth? 

Say what you wanna say 
And let the words fall out 
Honestly I wanna see you be brave 

With what you want to say 
And let the words fall out 
Honestly I wanna see you be brave 

I just wanna see you 
I just wanna see you 
I just wanna see you 
I wanna see you be brave 

I just wanna see you 
I just wanna see you 
I just wanna see you 
I wanna see you be brave 

I just wanna see you 
I just wanna see you 
I just wanna see you 
I wanna see you be brave 

I just wanna see you 
I just wanna see you 
I just wanna see you
