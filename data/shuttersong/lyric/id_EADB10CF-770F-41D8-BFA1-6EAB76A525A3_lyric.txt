Summer comes, winter fades,

Here we are just the same,
Don't need pressure, don't need change,
Let's not give the game away
There used to be an empty space,
A photograph without a face,
But with your presence and your grace,
Everything falls into place
Just please don't say you love me,

Cause I might not say it back,
Doesn't mean my heart stops skipping
When you look at me like that

And there's no need to worry when
You see just where we're at
Just please don't say you love me
Cause I might not say it back
Heavy words are hard to take,
Under pressure precious things can break,
And how we feel is hard to fake,

So let's not give the game away
Just please don't say you love me,
Cause I might not say it back,
Doesn't mean my heart stops skipping
When you look at me like that
And there's no need to worry when
You see just where we're at
Just please don't say you love me

Cause I might not say it back
And fools rush in
And I've been fooled before,

This time I'm gonna slow it down,
Cause I think this could be more,
The thing I'm looking for
Just please don't say you love me,
Cause I might not say it back,
Doesn't mean my heart stops skipping
When you look at me like that

There's no need to worry when
You see just where we're at
Just please don't say you love me
Cause I might not say it back
Please don't say you love me,
Cause I might not say it back,
Doesn't mean my heart stops skipping
When you look at me like that
And there's no need to worry when
You see just where we're at
Just please don't say you love me
Cause I might not say it back
Just please don't say you love me
Cause I might not say it back
