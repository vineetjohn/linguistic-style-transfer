Sitting here
on this
lonely dock
Watch the rain
play on the ocean top

All the things I feel I
need to say
I can't explain

in any other way
I need to be bold

Need to jump in the cold water
Need to grow older with a girl like you
Finally see you are naturally
The one to make it so easy when you show me the truth
Ye.ah,
I'd rather be with you

Say you want the same thing too

Now here's the sun
come
to dry the rain
Warm my shoulders and relieve my pain
You're the one thing that I'm
missing here
With you beside me
I no longer fear
I need to be bold
Need to jump in the cold water
Need to grow older with a girl like you
Finally see you are naturally
The one to make it so easy
When you show me the truth
Yeah,
I'd rather be with you
Say you want the same thing too
I could have saved so much time
for us
Had I seen the way
to get to where I am today
You waited on me for so long
So now,
listen to me say:
I need to be bold
Need to jump in the cold water
Need to grow older with a girl like you
Finally see you are naturally
The one to make it so easy
When you show me the truth
Yeah,
I'd rather be with you
Say you want the same thing too

Say you feel
the way I do
