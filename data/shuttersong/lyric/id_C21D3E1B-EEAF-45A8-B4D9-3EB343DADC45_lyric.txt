 walking around with me
And then she asks  me Do you feel all right
And I say Yes I feel wonderful tonight
I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you
It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps  me to bed
And then I tell her as I turn out the light
I say My darling you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling you were wonderful tonight
