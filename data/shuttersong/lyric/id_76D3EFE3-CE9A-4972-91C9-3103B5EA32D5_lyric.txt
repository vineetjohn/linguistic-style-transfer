Medetov If I had one single wish
I'd go back to the moment I kissed
You goodbye
No matter how hard I try

I can't live
Without you in my life
Maybe you'll say you still want me
Maybe you'll say that you don't

Maybe we said it was over
But Baby I can't let you go
I walk around trying to understand!
Where we went wrong

And I can't pretend
It wasn't me
And it wasn't you
But I'm convinced

We gave up too soon
Maybe you'll say you still want me
Maybe you'll say that you don't
Maybe we said it was over

But Baby I can't let you go
Nothing left to lose
After losing you
There's nothing I can't take

When I run to you
When I come for you
Don't tell me I'm too late
Maybe you'll say you still want me
Maybe you'll say that you don't
Maybe we said it was over
But Baby I can't let you go
No, no, no can't let you go
No can't let you go
No can't let you go
No can't let you go
