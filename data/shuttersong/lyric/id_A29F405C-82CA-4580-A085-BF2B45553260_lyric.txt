Coat of Many Colours

Back through the years I go wondering once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my mamma put the rags to use
There were rags of many colours, and every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall.
Mamma sewed the rags together, sewing every piece with love
She made my coat of many colours, that I was so proud of
As she sewed she told the story from the bible she had read
About a coat of many colours, Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you, good luck and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it, and mamma blessed it with a kiss
My coat of many colours that my mamma made for me
Made only from rags, but I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money. Woah! I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me
So with patches on my breaches and holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colours, I hurried off to school

Just to find the others laughing and makin' fun of me

In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me
And Oh, I couldn't understand it, for I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love my mamma sewed in every stitch
And I told them all the story, mamma told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colours was worth more than all of their clothes

But They didn't under stand it and I tried to make them see

That one is only poor only if they choose to be
Now I know we have no money, but I was
rich as I could be
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me
Made Just made for me.
