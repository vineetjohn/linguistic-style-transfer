Now excuse me if I sound rude
But I love the way that you move
And I see me all over you now
Baby when I look in your eyes
There's no way that I can disguise
All these crazy thoughts in my mind now
You got the lock
I got the key
You know the rest
You know just where I wanna be
Don't ever stop controlling me
I kinda like it when you bring me to my knees

You got me wrapped up
Around your finger
I'd do anything for your love now
And when you touch it, the feeling lingers
Takes me up so I high I can't come down
You got me wrapped up baby

I don't ever wanna give up
All this spell you got me under
I see fireworks when we touch now
There's just something about you
Your body fits on mine like a glove
Let them say whatever they want
It's too late cause you're in my blood now
There's just something about you
You got the lock
I got the key
You know the rest
You know just where I wanna be

Don't ever stop controlling me

I kinda like it when you bring me to my knees
You got me wrapped up
Around your finger
I'd do anything for your love now
And when you touch it, the feeling lingers
Takes me up so I high I can't come down
Girl, You got me wrapped up
You got me so, so wrapped up
There's just something about you

You wrapped up
You got me so, so wrapped up

There's just something about you
My princess so intelligent
Make me wanna reapply to school for the hell of it
I'll be the student, you be the teacher
Ms. Sophisticated, such a pleasure to meet ya
Yeah, but here's the only issue since we met
You kinda turned my world upside down
And I don't really mind spiderman kissing you
As long as you're planning on sticking around

The happiest boy in the world award goes to me
Not a chance nobody came close to 'em
I kinda knew you was troublesome

You got me wrapped around your finger like bubblegum
Everything that you do
Every way that you move

There's just something about you
There's just something about you
Everything that you do
Every way that you move

There's just something about you
Girl you got me wrapped up
Around your finger
I'd do anything for your love now
And when you touch it, the feeling lingers
Takes me up so I high I can't come down
Girl, You got me wrapped up
You got me so, so wrapped up
There's just something about you
You wrapped up
You got me so, so wrapped up
There's just something about you
