After school I always had to work
It kinda left me feeling like a jerk
'Cause I never got to talk to the guy I liked
And that ain't right
And then he met another type
Made him buy her all the things she liked
I learned a lot about life
When she jumped in his convertible

Singing
Oh oh oh
La da da da
Without a care in the world
Oh oh oh

La da da da
I'm not that kinda girl
Rich kids
Got a lot to say
Rich kids
Never have to pay

Everything's funny when you're young with money and mommy and daddy will pay the way
Rich kids
Never go to jail
Rich kids
Never buy on sale
Rich kids always have the most fun

Man I wish that I was one
A little later on in life
When finally I get my money right
It's still never enough

For the stuck up types
They say my money's new
And she's got a better view
As they sail away on their fathers yacht

This is what I got
Oh la da da da
Without a care in the world
Oh la da da da

I'm not that kinda girl
Rich kids
Got a lot to say
Rich kids
Never have to pay
Everything's funny when you're young with money and mommy and daddy will pay the way

Rich kids
Never go to jail
Rich kids
Never buy on sale
Rich kids always have the most fun
Man I wish that I was one

Maybe he's not for me
Maybe he did me a favor
Maybe he saved me some trouble down the line
But maybe she's just like me
Baby it's what they mean
Don't judge a book by the cover

Rich kids
Got a lot to say
Rich kids
Never have to pay
Everything's funny when you're young with money and mommy and daddy will pay the way
Rich kids never go to jail
Rich kids never buy on sale
Everything's funny when you're young with money and mommy and daddy will pay the way
