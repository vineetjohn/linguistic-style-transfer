Staring at two different views on your window ledge 
 
Coffee is going cold it's like time froze 
 
There you go wishing floating down our wishes well 

It's like I'm always causing problems causing hell 

I didn't mean to put you through this I can tell 

We're gonna sweep this under the carpet 

I hope that I can turn back the time 
 
To make it all alright all alright for us 
 
I'll promise to build a new world for us two 
 
With you in the middle 
 
Lying down beside you was going through your head 
 
The silence in the air felt like my soul froze 
 
I might just hope for thinking feelings I can't tell 
 
This gut feeling I'm tryna gain I feel it well 
 
I hope we find our missing pieces I'm just chill 

We're gonna sweep it under the carpet 

I hope that I can turn back the time 
 
To make it all alright all alright for us 
 
I'll promise to build a new world for us two 
 
With you in the middle 
 
With you in the middle 
 
With you in the middle 

You 
 
You
