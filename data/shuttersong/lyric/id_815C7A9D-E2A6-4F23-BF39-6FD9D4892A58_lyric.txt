Round one I couldn't believe it
You came and knocked me out
With those killer eyes
You stopped my heart from beating
Without saying a word
Took me by surprise

You're like a rush to my head
I'm out of breath
I can't keep up this time
You're always one step ahead
Leave me for dead
Girl you're the best and that's why

You make me wanna stand out tonight
Turn out the lights, give up the fight
I surrender
You got me good, I knew that you would
Did the best that I could
But girl you move like a butterfly, butterfly
Then you sting like a bee
I tried to be bulletproof, you got to me
Gonna stand out tonight, turn out the lights
Give up the fight
I surrender

Round two, I think I'm only dreaming
This just can't be for real
You're right here with me
I just don't wanna wait
Don't take me from this place
Where I wanna be

You're like a rush to my head
I'm out of breath
I can't keep up this time
You're always one step ahead
Leave me for dead
Girl you're the best and that's why

You make me wanna stand out tonight
Turn out the lights, give up the fight
I surrender
You got me good, I knew that you would
Did the best that I could
But girl you move like a butterfly, butterfly
Then you sting like a bee
I tried to be bulletproof, you got to me
Gonna stand out tonight, turn out the lights
Give up the fight
I surrender

I surrender

Ding ding like a bell ring, throw the towel in
She's one step ahead of anything I bring
I mean I'm not afraid to admit to defeat
She completes me completely
I'm free just to be who I am
So I'm never going down
Just believe in these dreams or reality
The reason I'm breathing
I'm taken, so baby just take me down
With the love I'm chasing

You make me wanna stand out tonight
Turn out the lights, give up the fight
I surrender
You got me good, I knew that you would
Did the best that I could
But girl you move like a butterfly, butterfly
Then you sting like a bee
I tried to be bulletproof, you got to me
Gonna stand out tonight, turn out the lights
Give up the fight
I surrender
Surrender
Surrender
