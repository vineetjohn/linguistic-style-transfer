In the morning when you wake
Might not wanna face today and all your heartache
Thinking how much can you take
Please don't ever loose the faith and don't fall under

In a world that seems to get colder & colder
Don't you worry couse
My love will only get stronger & stronger

Couse I, I, I, I, I'm gonna love you gonna hold ya through it all
I, I, I, I'm gonna love you gonna never let you fall
Through it all
Through it all
Don't think about the past, don't worry bout the future

Just live in the moment
Long as there's another day there will be another way
A chance to make it through
In a world that seems to get colder & colder

Don't you worry couse
My love will only get stronger & stronger
Couse I, I, I, I, I'm gonna love you gonna hold ya through it all

I, I, I, I'm gonna love you gonna never let you fall
Through it all
When you're down and out
Losing dignity

Don't let go of me (hold on)
Surely this is a brighter day right in front of me (hold on)
If you really looked inside
You would finally realize
You don't have to cry (no more)
All you have to do is see
That you can believe in me
And I will never leave
Couse I, I, I, I, I'm gonna love you gonna hold ya through it all
I, I, I, I'm gonna love you gonna never let you fall
Through it all
