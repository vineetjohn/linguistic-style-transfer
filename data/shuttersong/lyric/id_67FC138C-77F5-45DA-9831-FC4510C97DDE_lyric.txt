It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe
I don't want to miss out on the holiday
But I can't stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe
With you shawty with you
With you shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe
Everyone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chillin' with my folks I know
But I'mma be under the mistletoe
Word on the street's Santa's comin' tonight
Reindeer's flying through the sky so high
I should be making a list I know
But I'mma be under the mistletoe
With you shawty with you
With you shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe
With you shawty with you
With you shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe
Hey love
The wise men follow the star
They way I followed my heart
And it led me to a miracle
Hey love
Don't you buy me nothing
Cuz I am feeling one thing your lips on my lips
That's a very Merry Christmas
It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe
I don't want to miss out on the holiday
But I can't stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe
With you shawty with you
With you shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe
With you shawty with you
With you shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe
(Kiss me underneath the mistletoe)
(Show me baby that you love me so)
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
(Kiss me underneath the mistletoe)
(Show me baby that you love me so)
Ohhh ohhh
Mmmm
