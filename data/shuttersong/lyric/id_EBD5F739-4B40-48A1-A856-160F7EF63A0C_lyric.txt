HEAVEN - Troye Sivan/BETTY WHO
The truth runs wild
Like a tear down a cheek
Trying to save face and daddy heart break
I'm lying through my teeth
This voice inside
Has been eating at me
Trying to replace the love that I fake
With what we both need
The truth runs wild
Like kids on concrete
Trying to sedate my mind in its cage
And numb what I see
Awake wide eyed
I'm screaming at me
Trying to keep faith and picture his face
Staring up at me
Without losing a piece of me
How do I get to heaven
Without changing a part of me
How do I get to heaven
All my time is wasted
Feeling like my heart's mistaken oh
So if I'm losing a piece of me
Maybe I don't want heaven
The truth runs wild
Like the rain to the sea
Trying to set straight the lines that I trace
To find some release
This voice inside
Has been eating at me
Trying to embrace the picture I paint
And color me free
Without losing a piece of me
How do I get to heaven
Without changing a part of me
How do I get to heaven
All my time is wasted
Feeling like my heart's mistaken oh
So if I'm losing a piece of me
Maybe I don't want heaven
So I'm counting to fifteen
Counting to fifteen counting to fifteen
So I'm counting to fifteen
Counting to fifteen counting to fifteen
So I'm counting to fifteen
Counting to fifteen counting to fifteen
So I'm counting to fifteen
Counting to fifteen counting to fifteen
Without losing a piece of me
How do I get to heaven
Without changing a part of me
How do I get to heaven
All my time is wasted
Feeling like my heart's mistaken oh
So if I'm losing a piece of me
Maybe I don't want heaven
The truth runs wild
Like a tear down a cheek
