(Last night) our lovers quarrel (I was thinkin' about you)
Hurts more than I can say (and it was kinda dirty)
All night (and the way that you looked at me)
Help me here (it was kinda nasty ah), help me here

It was kinda trashy
'Cause I can't help my mind from going there

Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothin' to do
When I lay in bed I touch myself and think of you

Last night, damn, you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doin' really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Makin' love in my sex dreams

We could (I) be caught (just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought ('cause I'm broken)
Help me here (and I feel so trashy)
'Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads

But I've had a couple of drinks and \
