Another red letter day
So the pound has dropped and the children are created
The other half run away
Taking all the cash and leaving you with the lumber
Got a pain in the chest
Doctors on strike, what you need is a rest.
It's not easy love, but you've got friends you can trust

Friends will be friends

When you're in need of love they give you care and attention.

Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand 'cause friends will be friends
Right till the end.
Now it's a beautiful day
The postman delivered a letter from your lover

Only a phone call away
You tried to track him down but somebody stole his number

As a matter of fact
You're getting used to life without him in your way.
It's so easy now, 'cos you got friends you can trust

Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention.
Friends will be friends

When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand 'cos friends will be friends
Right till the end.
It's so easy now, 'cos you got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention.
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand 'cos friends will be friends
Right till the end.
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention.
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost.
Hold out your hand 'cos right till the end
Friends will be friends.
Yeah, yeah
