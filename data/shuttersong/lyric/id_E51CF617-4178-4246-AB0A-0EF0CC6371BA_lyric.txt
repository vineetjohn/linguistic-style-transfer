See I ain't no bitch nigga no rich nigga
No snitch nigga Ima real nigga that's real nigga

And Ima keep on smoking cause I luv this shit

Rollin through my hood rolling up some good
Shorty lips be rolling on the wood

Now she rolling her eye

Rollin on the floor laughing
Cause she looks so surprised

What you know about love?
Well love know about you
When I try something new
You refuse to believe that my love is true (God damn)
So I use all I got to prove to you
But the proof ain't enough so you move onto the next dude like
What he gon do? (ha!)
I don't understand these girls (girls, girls, girls, girls)
I don't understand these girls (girls, girls, girls, girls)
Looking for a real nigga
Like in all the wrong places

And all the wrong ways
They don't care, they don't change cause
She gon do what she want
And that is okay
And he gon do what he want
And that is okay
I said I luv it, luv it, luv it, luv it (luv it, luv it)

And Ima keep on smoking cause I luv this shit
And I'ma keep on grinding cause I luv this shit
She tell me keep fucking cause she luv this shit
