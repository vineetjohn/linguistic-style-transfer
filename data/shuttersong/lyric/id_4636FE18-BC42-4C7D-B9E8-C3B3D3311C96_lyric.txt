Look at me I'm such a basket case
Delivered to you wrapped in cellophane
Waiting on your doorstep every day
Delivery a basket filled with pain
Patience is your virtue, saint o' mine
I'd have fallen through the cracks without your love tonight
I'm your groundhog, and I'm skating on thin ice
But you see me at your feet and carry me inside
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh

Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
Oh can't you see I'm wrapped in cellophane?
Watch the blood pump through my veins
Electricity floods my brain

Can't hide the pain
Can't hide the pain
When you're wrapped in cellophane

Look at me I'm such a basket case
While I fall apart, you'll hide all my pills again

And all the things I need to hear you say
You'll watch as all my thoughts get right back on the train
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh

Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh

Oh can't you see I'm wrapped in cellophane?
Watch the blood pump through my veins
Electricity floods my brain
Can't hide the pain
Can't hide the pain
When you're wrapped in cellophane
Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh
Oh can't you see I'm wrapped in cellophane?
Watch the blood pump through my veins
Electricity floods my brain
Can't hide the pain
Can't hide the pain
When you're wrapped in cellophane
