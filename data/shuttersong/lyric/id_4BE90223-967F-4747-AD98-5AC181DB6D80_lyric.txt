Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feelin' lit, feelin' light, 2 am summer night.
I don't care, hand on the wheel, driving drunk, I'm doin' my thing
Rollin the Midwest side and out livin' my life getting' out dreams

People told me slow my roll I'm screaming out fuck that
Imma do just what I want lookin' ahead no turnin' back

If I fall if I die know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall if I die know I lived and missed some bullets
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold

(Hey)
I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
(Hey)

I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good
Tell me what you know about dreamin' dreamin'
You don't really know about nothin' nothin'
Tell me what you know about them night terrors every night

5 am cold sweats wakin' up to the sky
Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams

Tell me what you know about night terrors, nothin'
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow

Rather lay awake in a bed full of sorrow
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
(Hey)
I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good

I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
(Hey)
I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness
I know everythig that shine always gold
I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
(Hey)
I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
(Hey)
I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good

(Yeah)

Oh man, oh, uh, room's spinning, room's spinning.
That was really quick.
Ah, fuck it
Oh, God, why did I drink so much and smoke so much, ah
Ah, fuck it
