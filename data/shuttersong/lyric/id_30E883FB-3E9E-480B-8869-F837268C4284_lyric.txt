Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Papa was a copper and mama was a hippie
In Alabama she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you pick the panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world? What does your company take me for?

Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
Oh her merry way sayin' baby whatcha gonna
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal forty-five
Just another way to survive

California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah
She's a lover, baby and a fighter

Shoulda seen her coming when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya
A little loaded, she was stealin' another breath
I loved my baby to death
California, rest in peace

Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah
Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew what others died to prove?

Too true to say good bye to you
Too true to say say say...
Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later

Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a-gunnin' for the quota
Down in the badlands she was savin' the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh

Gone too fast...
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release

California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah
