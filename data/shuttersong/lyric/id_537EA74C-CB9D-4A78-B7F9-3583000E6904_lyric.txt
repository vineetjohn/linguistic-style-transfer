I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking

It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believing what you say that you never mean

Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last, but now you got it mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer, now sing

You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby, now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me (right)
And I'm gonna show ya (show 'em what, show 'em what)
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Than to mess with me harder (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

(Black, black widow, baby)

I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you I'm doing whatever works
You ain't never met nobody that'll do you how I do ya
That'll bring you to your knees
Praise Jesus, hallelujah

I'mma make you beg for it, plead for it
Till you feel like you breathe for it
Till you do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it
Wake up and dream for it
Till it's got you gasping for air, and you lean forward
Till they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me on it (on it, on it)

Now it's me-time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it
I want it, promise I need that
Till I'm everywhere that you be at
I can't fall back, go quick
'Cause this here is fatal attraction, so I take it all or I don't want shit

You used to be thirsty for me (right)
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby, now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me (right)
And I'm gonna show ya (show 'em what, show 'em what)
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

Black, black, black
Black widow, baby
