Angels - Owl City
Wake me if you're out there
Through the glass in my bedroom window
In the bushes far below
I thought I saw an unfamiliar shadow
Among the ones I so clearly know
I've been sleeping with the nightlight unplugged
With a note on the rocking chair
That says I'm dreaming of the life I once loved
So wake me if you're out there
Living close to the ground
It's seventh heaven cause there are angels all around
Among my frivolous thoughts
I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts
So wake me if you're out there
Wake me if you're out there
In the dust on my cellar staircase
A pair of footprints followed me
I saw a flicker in the fake fireplace
Blinked again but there was nothing to see
I've been leaving all the windows unlocked
With a basket by the oak tree
Cause I'll be picking up the acorns that fall off
If you'll be climbing up to meet me
Living close to the ground
It's seventh heaven cause there are angels all around
Among my frivolous thoughts
I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts
So wake me if you're out there
I keep my knees black and blue
Cause they often hit the hardwood floor
Wake me if you're out there
And I believe so I'm not praying to the ceiling anymore
And I've been sleeping with the nightlight unplugged
With a note on the rocking chair
That says I'm dreaming of the life I once loved
So wake me if you're out there
Living close to the ground
It's seventh heaven cause there are angels all around
Among my frivolous thoughts
I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts
The indications reveal
Wake me if you're out there
That few of us realise life is quite so real
So if you're dying to see
I guarantee there are angels around your vicinity
So if you're dying to see
I guarantee there are angels around your vicinity
