Boy, you know that I want it
I can tell you want me as your lady
Can't deny that you're sexy
So what's it gon' be

[Normani:]
Is you gon' get a job
And make some of that green
You tryna take me out
But you can't pay for me
I guess I got the cash
I'll take one for the team
Baby, can't you see?

[Lauren:]
Oh, oh
I won't ask you to go

[Chorus:]
But I can't be your suga mama
Your suga mama, baby
I can't be your suga mama
I said, I said
I can't be your suga mama
Your suga mama mmmmm mmmm
I can't be your suga mama
Your suga mama, baby
I can't be your suga mama
And even though I love the thought of you
No, I can't be your... can't be your
Su-, su-, su-, your suga mama
Su-, su-, su-, your suga mama
Su-, su-, su-, your suga mama
Mmmmmm, yeah

[Ally:]
"Hey"
I love what you do to me
Ain't nobody love me like, like you do
I won't call you lazy
But how you pay for food

[Dinah:]
My daddy said, "No."
You ain't good for me
Not ballin' in that dough
But I'm paying for your things
Somethings gotta change, boy
Hmm, please (boy, please)
Oh, baby, can't you see?

[Lauren:]
Oh, oh
I won't ask you to go

[Chorus:]
But I can't be your suga mama
Your suga mama, baby
I can't be your suga mama
I said, I said
I can't be your suga mama
Your suga mama mmmmm mmmm
I can't be your suga mama
Your suga mama, baby
I can't be your suga mama
And even though I love the thought of you
No, I can't be your, I can't be your
Su-, su-, su-, your suga mama
Su-, su-, su-, your suga mama
Su-, su-, su-, your suga mama
Mmmmmm yeah

Ain't got that money money
Ain't got a damn thang
Wish you could be my honey
You make me sang sang
Ain't got that money money
Ain't got a damn thang
What you want me to say, oh

[Chorus:]
But I can't be your suga mama
Your suga mama, baby
I can't be your suga mama
I said, I said
I can't be your suga mama
Your suga mama mmmmm mmmm
I can't be your suga mama
Your suga mama, baby

And even though I love the thought of you
No, I can't be your, I can't be your
Su-, su-, su-, your suga mama
Su-, su-, su-, your suga mama
Su-, su-, su-, your suga mama
Su-, su-, su-, your suga mama
Su-, su-, su-, your suga mama
Su-, su-, su-, your suga mama

Oh I can't be your suga mama
