You lift my heart up
When the rest of me is down (never)
You, you enchant me, even when you're not around (never)
If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down (never)
I¡¯m latching on bae
Now I know what I have found (never)

I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we¡¯re close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby
Now I got you in my space
I won¡¯t let go with you (never)
Got you shackled in my embrace
I¡¯m latching on to you (never)
Now I got you in my space
I won¡¯t let go with you (never)
Got you shackled in my embrace
I¡¯m latching on to you (never)

I¡¯m so encaptured, got me wrapped up in your touch (never)
Feel so enamored, hold me tight within your clutch (never)
How do you do it, you got me losing every breath (never)
What did you give me to make my heart beat out my chest (never)

I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we¡¯re close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby
I feel we¡¯re close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we¡¯re close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby

Now I got you in my space
I won¡¯t let go with you (never)
Got you shackled in my embrace
I¡¯m latching on to you (never)
Now I got you in my space
I won¡¯t let go with you (never)
Got you shackled in my embrace
I¡¯m latching on to you (never)
latching on you
I won¡¯t let go with you (never)
latching on you
I won¡¯t let go with you
