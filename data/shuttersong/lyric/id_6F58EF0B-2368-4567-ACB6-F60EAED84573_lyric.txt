Sun is filling up the room
And I can hear you dreaming
Do you feel the way I do?
Right now?

I wish we would just give up
'Cause the best part is falling
Calling anything but love

And I will make sure
To keep my distance
Say I love you
When you're not listening
And how long
Can we keep this up, up, up?
Please don't stand so close to me

I'm having trouble breathing
I'm afraid of what you'll see
Right now
I'll give you everything I am

All my broken heartbeats
Until I know you'll understand
And I will make sure

To keep my distance
Say I love you
When you're not listening
And how long
Can we keep this up, up, up?
And I keep waiting
For you to take me

You keep waiting
To save what we have
So I'll make sure
To keep my distance

Say I love you
When you're not listening
And how long
Can we keep this up, up, up?
Make sure
To keep my distance
Say I love you
When you're not listening
And how long
Till we call this love, love, love?
