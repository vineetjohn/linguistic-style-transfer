Rap phat I'm that dude

My backpack got cash that

I make an ass clap like tap shoes

I'm international

Y'all niggas vaginal

I pass through, fresh to death

You've now entered swag school

Ladies holding kisses

Swag as cold as sickness

Team Driicky tatted on 'em cause they're ass is so ridiculous

In the 'Mazzi, paparazzi

Man they can't control the pictures

New M.O.B. tat, screaming money over bitches

My clothes and tatts they're all custom though

Something that you ain't accustom to

Don't collapse with the Huxtables

Hoes like hats they adjustable

This is for my ladies and my fellas getting gravy

But your body's marked up, like the train back in the 80s

I've been through the test

Now, I'm inking my chest

Trying to triple my chest

I spit through the rest

Buy you a Mitchell & Ness

Fly and It'll fit you the best

From NY to LA

North Cackalack to Baton Rouge

All across the latitude

Everybody rockin' them

"Clack Clack" and snatch jewels

Pack tools, Crap shoot

And sell crack in glass tubes

Our chicks? Attitude

Hard enough to get at a dude

Tatted up, fattest butt

Suck it off, vacuum

Trips to Miami Ink

After that, Lowrider

When I say we're balling trick

I don't mean no globetrotter

Driicky is a monster, ain't a heir up in his safe

Since I murder raps, I should tatt a tear up on my face

Can't you hear this flow? It's evil

Can't be near us close to lethal

Y'all are weird

Yo I'm just here to spit 'bout piercings, clothes, and needles

Grab some cheer-up for the people

Rappers fear cause most is legal

I don't have to smoke I rap the dope considered so illegal

To all my Gs up, can I just get a witness

If you're inked up, from your feet up

Or you're stylin' in a Mitch-Ness

Ain't leaving out my females

I'm talking 'bout that ass too

Show 'em all

Roll Call

Let them bitches know we wear them
