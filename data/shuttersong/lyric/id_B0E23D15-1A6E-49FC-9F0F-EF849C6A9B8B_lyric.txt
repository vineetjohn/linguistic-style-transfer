Coming soon
something good
Something we can share
Understood
Could be better news
we can share
Something's coming soon
I hear it everywhere

(Live it)
It's the story of our lives
(Don't give it)
It's the way we've always been
(Live it)
Though the mountains may divide
(Don't give it)
we can reach the sea

And I believe
we can change
we can make it more than a dream
And I believe
we can change
It's not as strange as it might seem

In the air I can feel
something magical becoming real
From the other side
looking in
Come on throw the dice
and tonight we'll win

(Live it)
It's the story of our lives
(Don't give it)
It's the way we've always been
(Live it)
Though the mountains may divide
(Don't give it)
we can reach the sea

And I believe
we can change
we can make it more than a dream
And I believe
we can change
It's not as strange as it might seem

Driving through the night
just you and me
Faster than the pale moonlight
Something's calling
Calling us away
Do you believe
Heaven is a better place?
We'll be there in a heartbeat

I believe
we can change
we can make it more than a dream
And I believe
we can change
It's not as strange as it might seem
