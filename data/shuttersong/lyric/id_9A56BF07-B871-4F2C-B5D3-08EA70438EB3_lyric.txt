Here we come
Holding onto lies, holding onto ties that vanished
Cut the rope
And fall into the sky, the devil filled our minds with sadness

The world's a gun and I've been aiming all my life
Got something to live for, I know that I won't surrender
A warrior of youth
I'm taking over, a shot to the new world order
I Am Bulletproof

Here I come
Another prison flight, another perfect sky I damaged
Now I know
Just who created life and why I set my sights to save it

The world's a gun and I've been aiming all my life
Got something to live for, I know that I won't surrender
A warrior of youth
I'm taking over, a shot to the new world order
I Am Bulletproof

And as they take their final breath
I have built the truth
I'm taking over a shot to the new world order
I Am Bulletproof

Bulletproof
Bulletproof

Got something to live for
I know that I won't surrender
A warrior of youth
I'm taking over, a shot to the new world order
I Am Bulletproof
Got something to live for
I know that I won't surrender
A warrior of youth
I'm taking over, a shot to the new world order
I Am Bulletproof
