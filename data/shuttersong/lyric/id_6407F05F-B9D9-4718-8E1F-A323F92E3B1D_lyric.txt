Oh 
Shooby doo dooby doo boi oi 
Yeah, ah 

Girl, you're my angel, you're my darling angel 
Closer than my peeps you are to me, baby 
Shorty, you're my angel, you're my darling angel 
Girl, you're my friend when I'm in need, lady 

Life is one big party when you're still young 
But who's gonna have your back when it's all done 
It's all good when you're little, you have pure fun 
Can't be a fool, son, what about the long run 
Looking back Shorty always mention 
Said me not giving her much attention 
She was there through my incarceration 
I wanna show the nation my appreciation 

Girl, you're my angel, you're my darling angel 
Closer than my peeps you are to me, baby 
Shorty, you're my angel, you're my darling angel 
Girl, you're my friend when I'm in need, lady 

You're a queen and so you should be treated 
Though you never get the lovin' that you needed 
Could have left, but I called and you heeded 
Begged and I pleaded, mission completed 
Mama said that I and I dissed the program 
Not the type to mess around with her emotion 
But the feeling that I have for you is so strong 
Been together so long and this could never be wrong 

Girl, you're my angel, you're my darling angel 
Closer than my peeps you are to me, baby

Girl, you're my friend when I'm in need, lady 

Uh, uh 
Girl, in spite of my behavior, said I'm your savior 
(You must be sent from up above) 
And you appear to me so tender, say girl I surrender 
(Thanks for giving me your love) 

Girl, in spite of my behavior, well, you are my savior 
(You must be sent from up above) 
And you appear to me so tender, well, girl I surrender 
(Said thanks for giving me your love) 

Now life is one big party when you're still young 
And who's gonna have your back when it's all done 
It's all good when you're little, you have pure fun 
Can't be a fool, son, what about the long run
