The star that gives us light
Has been gone a while
But it¡¯s not an illusion
The ache in my heart
Is so much a part of who I am

Something in your eyes
Took a thousand years to get here
Something in your eyes
Took a thousand years, a thousand years

Hold me close 
Hold me close and don¡¯t let me go
Hold me close
Like I¡¯m someone that you might know
Hold me close
The darkness just lets us see
Who we are
I¡¯ve got your life inside of me

Iris, Iris

Once we are born
We begin to forget
The very reason we came
But you I¡¯m sure I¡¯ve met
Long before the night
The start went out
We¡¯re meeting up again

Hold me close 
Hold me close and don¡¯t let me go
Hold me close
Like I¡¯m someone that you might know
Hold me close
The darkness just lets us see
Who we are
I¡¯ve got your life inside of me

Iris, Iris
The start are bright
But do they know
The universe is beautiful but cold
You took me by the hand
I thought that I was leading you
But it was you made me your man
Machine, I dream where you are
Iris standing in the hall
She tells me I can do it all
Iris wakes to my nightmare
Don¡¯t fear the world
It isn¡¯t there

Iris playing on the strand
She buries the boy beneath the sand
Iris says that I will be the death of her
It was not me

Iris, Iris
She said free yourself to be yourself
If only you could see yourself
Free yourself to be yourself
If only you could see
