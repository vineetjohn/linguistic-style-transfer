Ain't Nothing 'Bout You
The way you look, the way you laugh,The way you love with all you have.
There ain't nothing about you,That don't do something for me.
The way you kiss, the way you cry,The way you move when you walk by.
There's ain't nothing about you,That don't do something for me.
Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough

Oh whoa,In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery
Why I surrender
Boy you got everything

I love your attitude, All your tattoos,
Your every thought
Your smile, you lips
And boy the list goes on and on and on
The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There's ain't nothing about you
That don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing 'bout you
That don't do something for me
The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
Your dance, your drive, you make me feel alive
Right now I think you see
There ain't nothin' about you
That don't do something for me
