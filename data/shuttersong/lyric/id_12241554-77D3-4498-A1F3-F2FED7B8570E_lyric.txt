I don't ever ask you
Where you've been
And I don't feel the need to
Know who you're with

I can't even think straight
But I can tell
That you were just with her
And I'll still be a fool
I'm a fool for you

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

I don't ever tell you
How I really feel
Cause I can't find the words to
Say what I mean

And nothing's ever easy
That's what they say
I know I'm not your only
But I'll still be a fool
Cause I'm a fool for you

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

(Just a little bit)
(Mmm, yeah yeah yeah yeah)

I know I'm not your only
But at least I'm one
I heard a little love
Is better than none

(Oh, babe)

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart (just a little bit)
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
