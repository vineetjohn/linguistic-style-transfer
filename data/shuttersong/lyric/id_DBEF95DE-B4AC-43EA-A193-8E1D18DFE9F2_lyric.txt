"Genesis"

My heart will never feel (be)
Will never see
Will never know
Oh, heart
And then it falls
And then I fall
And then I know [x4]

My, My, My
Ever see, ever be, ever know
My heart
Ever see, ever be, ever know
My heart

Home and I know
Playing the deck above
It's always different
I'm the one in love [x4]

My heart will never feel (be)
Will never see
Will never know
Oh, heart
And then it falls
And then I fall
And then I know [x2]

Ever see, ever be, ever know
My heart
Ever see, ever be, ever know

Home and I know
Playing the deck above
It's always different
I'm the one in love [x2]

Home and I know
Playing the deck above
It's always different (now)
I'm the one in love [x2]
