I don't fuck with you

You lil stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you

You lil, you lil dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you

I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do

Than to be fuckin' with you, lil stupid ass

I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck

I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck

Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic

Then you post it up, thinkin' that its makin' me sick

I see you calling, I be makin' it quick

I'mma answer that shit like: "I don't fuck with you"

Bitch I got no feelings to go

I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go

I mean for real, fuck how you feel

Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill, yeah

And everyday I wake up celebratin' shit, why?

Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch

I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich

That's what put me on, that's what got me here

That's what made me this

And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)

These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain

Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me

I just bought a crib, three stories, that bitch a trilogy

And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone

I got a bitch that text me, she ain't got no clothes on

And then another one text, then your ass next

And I'm gonna text your ass back like

+

Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online

Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs and you ain't on your grind

You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D

Fuckin' off fetti I coulda put on property

From the Bay to the Murder Mitten, my niggas put murder missions

She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison

On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit

For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich

Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental

On my way, to Sacramento, late night, Arsenio

I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless

Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless

I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me

I'll make a bitch stand outside forever like the Statue of Liberty

Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South

I raise my Styrofoam up, and pour some drank in my mouth

Why you always coming around with bad news?

Say you want me to win, but hope I lose

Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew

But them niggas cool, it's just that

+

I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for

I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for

Yeah I got a lot but want a lot more

Yeah we in the buildin' but I'm tryna take it to the top floor

I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up

It seems like nowadays everybody breakin' up

That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl

I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up

I guess drama makes for the best content

Everything got a bad side, even a conscience

Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious

Feel me when you get a fine bitch

Just don't forget to read the fine print

Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas

Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator

Yeah I know that karma's too real so I hope you doin' cool

But still stupid ass bitch I ain't fuckin' with you

Little stupid ass I ain't fuckin with

I ain't fuckin', I ain't, I ain't fuckin' with you

I ain't fuckin' with you

(Straight up)
