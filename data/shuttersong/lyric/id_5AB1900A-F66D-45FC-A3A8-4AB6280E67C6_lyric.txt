Shawty's like a melody in my head 
Sean Kingston 
 
 
Shawty's like a melody in my head 
That I can't keep out 
Got me singing like 
Na na na na everyday 
It's like my i-pod is stuck on replay 
Replay replay ay ay ay 
 
Shawty's like a melody in my head 
That I can't keep out 
Got me singing like 
Na na na na everyday 
It's like my i-pod is stuck on replay 
Replay replay ay ay ay 
 
Remember the first time we met 
You was at the mall wit yo friend 
I was scared to approach ya 
But then you came closer 
Hopin you would give me a chance 
Who wou; d have ever knew 
That we would be more than friends 
 
We're real worldwide 
Breakin all the rules 
She like a song played again and again 
 
That girl, like somthin off a poster 
That girl, is a dime they say 
That girl, is a gun to my holster 
She's runnin through my mind all day, ay

Replay replay ay ay ay

See you been all around the globe 
Not once did you leave my mind 
We talk on the phone from night til the morn 
Girl you really change my life 
Doin things I never do 
I'm in the kitchen cookin things she likes 
 
We're real worldwide 
Breakin all the rules 
Someday I wanna make you my wife 
That girl, like somthingoff a poster 
That girl, is a dime they say 
That girl, is the gun to my holster 
She's running through my mind all day, ay

The one that could fill your fantasies 
So come baby girl let's sing with me
