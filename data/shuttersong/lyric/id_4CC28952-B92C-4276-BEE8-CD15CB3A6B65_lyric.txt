Can you blow my whistle, baby?
Whistle, baby, let me know
Girl, I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow
You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle, baby?
Whistle, baby, here we go

I'm betting you like bebop (kind of music)
And I'm betting you love freak mode
And I'm betting you like girls
That give love to girls and stroke your little ego

I bet you I'm guilty, your honor
That's just how we live in my genre
Went to hell and paid the Rottweiler
There's only one Flo and one Rida

I'm a damn shame, order more champagne
Pulled a damn ham string, trying to put it on ya
Bet your lips spin back around corner
Slow it down baby, take a little longer

Can you blow my whistle, baby?
Whistle, baby, let me know
Girl, I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow

You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle, baby?
Whistle, baby, here we go

Whistle baby, whistle, baby
Whistle baby, whistle, baby
Whistle baby, whistle, baby
Whistle baby, whistle, baby

It's like everywhere I go, my whistle ready to flow
Shorty don't even know, she can get any by the low
Tell me she not a pro, it's okay, it's under control
Show me soprano 'cause girl, you can handle

Baby, we start snagging, you come up in part clothes
Girl, I'm losing wing, my Bugatti the same road
Show me your perfect pitch, you got it my banjo
Talented with your lips like you blew out a candle

So amusing
Now you can make a whistle with the music
Hope you ain't got no issue, you can do it
Give me the perfect pitch, you never lose it

Can you blow my whistle, baby?
Whistle, baby, let me know
Girl, I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow

You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle, baby?
Whistle, baby, here we go

Whistle baby, whistle, baby
Whistle baby, whistle, baby
Whistle baby, whistle, baby
Whistle baby, whistle, baby

Go on girl, you can perk it
Let me see your whistle while you work it
I'ma lay it back, don't stop it
'Cause I love it how you drop it, drop it, drop it on me

Now, shorty let that whistle blow
Yeah, baby make that whistle blow

Can you blow my whistle, baby?
Whistle, baby, let me know
Girl, I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow

You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle, baby?
Whistle, baby, here we go

Can you blow my whistle, baby?
Whistle baby, whistle, baby
Whistle baby, whistle, baby

Can you blow my whistle, baby?
Whistle baby, whistle, baby
Whistle baby, whistle, baby

Can you blow my whistle, baby?
Whistle baby, whistle, baby
Whistle baby, whistle, baby

Can you blow my whistle, baby?
Whistle baby, whistle, baby
Whistle baby, whistle, baby
