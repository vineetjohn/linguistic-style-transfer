In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me

Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?

I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me
Turn me into phantoms
I follow to the edge
Of the earth
And fall off

Yeah, everybody leaves
If they get the chance
And this...
is my chance

I get eaten by the worms
And weird fishes
Picked over by the worms
And weird fishes

Weird fishes
Weird fishes

Yeah I, I'll hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
¡°
Hit the bottom and escape
¡ª Radiohead
I, I hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
