Feels so good being bad (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
There's no way I'm turning back (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Now the pain is for pleasure 'cause nothing can measure (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)

Love is great, love is fine (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Out the box, out of line (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)

'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones but chains and whips excite me

'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones but chains and whips excite me

Come on, come on, come on

Come on, come on, come on

Come on, come on, come on

Oh, I love the feeling you bring to me, oh, you turn me on
It's exactly what I've been yearning for give it to me strong
And meet me in my boudoir make my body say ah, ah, ah, I like it, like it

'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones but chains and whips excite me
