To the top of all the world
To the tasteless underworld
To the center of your heart, oh Cleopatra is the only one you loved
To the demonstrated smile
To the lonely love child
Destination desolation, tell me when you reach the brink of life
Just a picture on your wall
That's nice, what a metaphoric fall
Typically, I was a validation on your sleeve
Oh, what an indication
To the center of the pain
Through the tattered window pane
To the middle of your heart

Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line

Selene
This is not what I expect, this is not what I expect
I can see it in your tears and now they're crowning me the Caesar
Typically, I was a validation on your sleeve
Oh, what an indication
To the center of the pain
Through your tattered window pane

To the middle of your heart
Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing

This is my heart, it's on the line
Selene
(...)
This is my heart, it's on the line
This is my heart, it's on the line
This is my heart, it's on the line
Selene
Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line
Selene
