They came along and washed my soul so easy
High above myself, but I could hear them anyway
The wind is taking them away so feathery
To show them all the places they can reach
And it's not too far for them to go and leave
Me all alone like there is no guaranty for such a dream
And they bequeath me a black feather on the way
And I thought: Yes, I am a dreamer and these feathers
They won't stay

And I will try
Try to hold you
With my arms around your heart
Even though love is going to kill me

I will try...

And I will try
Try to hold you
With my arms around your heart
Even though love is going to kill me
I will try...
