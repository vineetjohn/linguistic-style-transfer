I've got a house in the back of my head
but I can't find a permanent resident
cause the market's down
and the area's not so good these days

I've got a watch but I don't have time
I got a road and it leads to decadance
but a dead end sign waits down the line
I leave my footprints for the evidence

So take my life, I'll hand it to you
and you can try on my clothes

but you can't fill these shoes
on a silver platter your wish came true
so your heart of gold turned platinum

you can take my life
but you can't take it with you

More long days and fleeting nights
I tell 'em wake me under flashing lights
cause I'm a brand name bought and sold

they say a face for fame
is a crying shame
because you face the crowd just to play their game

and I can play a little too rough
now and again(every now and again)
you drank the poison, and I let you in

So take my life, I'll hand it to you
and you can try on my clothes
but you can't fill these shoes

on a silver platter your wish came true
so your heart of gold turned platinum
you can take my life

but you can't take it with you
You drank the poison and I, I let you in
would you trade that heart of gold
for a minute in my skin?
you drank the poison and I, I let you in

on a silver platter your wish came true
