Dog goes woof
Cat goes meow
Bird goes tweet
And mouse goes squeek

Cow goes moo
Frog goes croak
And the elephant goes toot

Ducks say quack
And fish go blub
And the seal goes ow, ow, ow

But there's one sound
That no one knows
What does the fox say?

Ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding
Gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding
Gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding
What the fox say?

Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow
Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow
Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow
What the fox say?

Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho
Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho
Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho
What the fox say?

Joff-tchoff-tchoff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff
Joff-tchoffo-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff
Joff-tchoff-tchoff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff
What the fox say?

Big blue eyes, pointy nose
Chasing mice and digging holes
Tiny paws up the hill
Suddenly you're standing still

Your fur is red, so beautiful
Like an angel in disguise
But if you meet a friendly horse
Will you communicate by
Mo-o-o-o-orse?
Mo-o-o-o-orse?
Mo-o-o-o-orse?

How will you speak to that
Ho-o-o-o-orse?
Ho-o-o-o-orse?
Ho-o-o-o-orse?
What does the fox say?

Jacha-chacha-chacha-chow
Chacha-chacha-chacha-chow
Chacha-chacha-chacha-chow
What the fox say?

Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow
Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow
Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow
What the fox say?

A-hee-ahee ha-hee
A-hee-ahee ha-hee
A-hee-ahee ha-hee
What the fox say?

A-oo-oo-oo-ooo
Woo-oo-oo-ooo
What does the fox say?

The secret of the fox
Ancient mystery
Somewhere deep in the woods
I know you're hiding

What is your sound?
Will we ever know?
Will always be a mystery?
What do you say?

You're my guardian angel
Hiding in the woods
What is your sound?

Wa-wa-way-do
Wub-wid-bid-dum-way-do
Wa-wa-way-do
Will we ever know?

Bay-budabud-dum-bam
I want to
Mama-dum-day-do
I want to
I want to know
Abay-ba-da bum-bum bay-dum
