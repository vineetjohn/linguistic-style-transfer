Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got the healing that I want
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

We got this king size to ourselves
Don't have to share with no one else
Don't keep your secrets to yourself
It's karma sutra show and tell
Yeah

Woah
There's loving in your eyes
That pulls me closer
(That pulls me closer)
It's so subtle
(It's so subtle)
I'm in trouble
(I'm in trouble)
But I'd love to be in trouble with you

Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got the healing that I want
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got to give it up to me
I'm screaming mercy, mercy please
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

And when you leave me all alone
I'm like a stray without a home
I'm like a dog without a bone
I just want you for my own
I got to have you babe

Woah
There's loving in your eyes
That pulls me closer
(That pulls me closer)
It's so subtle
(It's so subtle)
I'm in trouble
(I'm in trouble)

But I'd love to be in trouble with you
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
Oh baby, you got that healing that I want
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn

let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got that healing that I want
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn

let's Marvin Gaye and get it on, baby
You got to give it up to me
I'm screaming mercy, mercy please
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
