Give me light
Give me action
At the touch of a button
Flying through hyper-space
In a computer interface
Stop – living on video
Stop – integrated circuits
Stop – sur un faisceau de lumieres
Stop – is this reality?

Traveling in a light beam
Laser rays and purple skies
In a computer fairyland
It is a dream you bring to life
Stop – living on video
Stop – integrated circuits…
Stop – sur un
Faisceau de lumieres
Stop – is this reality?

I see your glitterring blue eyes
You look at me with a smile
It's a computer fantasy
It is waiting for you and me
Living – living on video
Living – living on video

Living – living on video
Living – living on video – stop…
