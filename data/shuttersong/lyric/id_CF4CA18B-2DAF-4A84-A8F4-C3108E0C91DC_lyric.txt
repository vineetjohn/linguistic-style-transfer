I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment, for all my life Oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord, Oh Lord
Well, if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
Well, I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies
And I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life Oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life Oh Lord, oh Lord
Well I remember
I remember, don't worry
How could I ever forget
It's the first time, the last time we ever met
But I know the reason why you keep this silence up
No you don't fool me
The hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows
It's no stranger to you and me
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
Well I've been waiting for this moment, for all my life Oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight Oh Lord, oh Lord
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life Oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life Oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight Oh Lord, oh Lord
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, Oh Lord, oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life Oh Lord's
I can feel it coming on the
air tonight
Oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment all of my life
Oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight
Oh Lord, oh Lord
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight
