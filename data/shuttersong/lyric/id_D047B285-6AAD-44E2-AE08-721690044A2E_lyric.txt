You're on your own
In a world you've grown
Few more years to go
Don't let the hurdle fall
So be the girl you loved

Be the girl you loved

I'll wait
So show me while you're strong
Ignore everybody else
We're alone now
I'll wait

So show me while you're strong

Ignore everybody else
We're alone now
Suddenly I'm hit
Is this darkness or the dawn?

And your friends are gone
And your friends won't come

So show me where you fit

So show me where you fit

I'll wait
So show me while you're strong
Ignore everybody else
We're alone now
I'll wait
I'll wait

Suddenly I'm hit

Is this darkness or the dawn?
And your friends are gone
And your friends won't come
So show me where you fit
So show me where you fit
