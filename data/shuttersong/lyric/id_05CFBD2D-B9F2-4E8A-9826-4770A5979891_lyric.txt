Some people got soul
Some people got passion
Some people got wisdom
But you got it all

Some people got strength
Some people got courage
Some people got vision
But you got it all

Some people got drive
Some people got talent
Some people got style
But you got it all

Some people live life
Some people stay balanced
You're everything I ever want in a girl

'cause you got it all
'cause you got it all
You got it all
And I want all of it
Every little bit of all of it

Some people got curves
Some people got beauty
That's deeper than words
But you got it all

Some people get wild
Some people stay classy
You're everything I ever want in a girl

'cause you got it all
'cause you got it all
You got it all
So don't you change a thing
Cause I like everything about you
From your hazy toes, from your lips to your nose
You're perfect in my eyes

Some people got soul
Some people got passion
Some people got heart
But you got it all

'cause you got it all
You got it all
Some people got soul
Some people got passion
Some people got wisdom
But you got it all
Some people got strength
Some people got courage
Some people got vision
But you got it all
'cause you got it all
