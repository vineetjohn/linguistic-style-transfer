No more talk of darkness
forget these wide-eyed fears
I'm here, nothing can harm you
my words will warm and calm you.

Let me be your freedom
let daylight dry your tears
I'm here, with you, beside you
to guard you and to guide you.

Say you love me every waking moment
turn my head with talk of summertime.
Say you need me with you now and always
promise me that all you say is true
that's all I ask of you.
Let me be your shelter

let me be your light
you're safe, no one will find you
your fears are far behind you.
All I want is freedom

a world with no more night
and you, always beside me
to hold me and to hide me.
Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime

let me lead you from your solitude.
Say you need me with you, here beside you
anywhere you go, let me go too
Christine, that's all I ask of you
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime

say the word and I will follow you.
Share each day with me

each night, each morning.
Say you love me!
You know I do.
Love me, that's all I ask of you
ANYWHERE you go
Let me go too.
Love me
That's all I ask of you.
