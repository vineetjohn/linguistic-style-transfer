Our day has come
It's drawn in the sky
So don't shed a tear now
Be thankful for the time

Life wouldn't be so precious dear if there never was an end

Children still play in the garden
Dance as the sun slips away

We stand on the edge now
We've come so far
Through all the dust it becomes clear
You will always be my heart

There's no death, no end of time when I'm facing it with you

Children still play in the garden
Dance as the sun slips away
Not even stars last forever
Cleanse us Acid rain

Stand near to me
Don't look be brave
Over the blackened moon
I'll carry you away
Through the planets we fly

Children still play in the garden
Dance as the sun slips away
Not even stars last forever
Cleanse us Acid rain
Send us home
Send us home
Send us home
Send us home
