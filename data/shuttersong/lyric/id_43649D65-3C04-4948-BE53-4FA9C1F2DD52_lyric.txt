Decisions, but I want it all so I get it all
I wanna eat the whole cake
I'm not sharing, I'm not sharing
You should have learned how to bake

Yes I want it all so I get it all
I wanna eat the whole cake
I'm not sharing, I'm not sharing
You should have learned bitches love cake!

Decisions, but I want it all so I get it all
I wanna eat the whole cake
I'm not sharing, I'm not sharing
You should have learned how to bake

Yes I want it all so I get it all
I wanna eat the whole cake
I'm not sharing, I'm not sharing
You should have learned bitches love cake!
Decisions, between a family or a porn star
Humble life or sports cars, liver or the whole bar
Headache for my management, gossip columns resident
Your mom and dad might hate me but in 5 years I'm the president
I wanna girl, I get her. And I get her friend
Five girls singing in my bedroom, start my own band
They love me in my peak, but this love is fake
Everyday's my birthday, cause bitches love cake
