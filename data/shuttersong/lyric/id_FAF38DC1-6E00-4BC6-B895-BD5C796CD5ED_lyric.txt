I wish there was another you, 'nother way

And I just can't find the words I should say

If I wanna tell you how I feel, how I feel

Without breaking all that we've made

But they say life goes on anyway

If things should change, oh yeah

Stuck in the same old melody, of misery

And don't you remember

All of the times we spent late at night

We wasted our breath

We're over and done with

I couldn't see what you did to me

It's not for the best

We're over and done with

And I just can't stay another night

The last thing that I ever wanted to do

Was to say goodbye to you

Tell me if it's right or wrong, right or wrong

Staring at your pictures till the shadows fade

Acting like there's nothing wrong, nothing wrong

What we had is slipping away

But they say life goes on anyway

If things should change, oh yeah

Stuck in the same old melody, of misery

And don't you forget that

All of the times we spent late at night

We wasted our breath

We're over and done with

I couldn't see what you did to me

It's not for the best

We're over and done with

And I just can't stay another night

The last thing that I ever wanted to do

Was to say goodbye to you

You say that I

I'm the one who's changed

But I can't keep on

Living life this way

You say that I

I'm the one who's changed

Yeah...

You say that I

I'm the one who's changed

But I can't keep on

Living life this way

You say that I

I'm the one who's changed

I'll find another you another way

All of the times we spent late at night

We wasted our breath

We're over and done with

I couldn't see what you did to me

It's not for the best

We're over and done with

And I just can't stay another night

The last thing that I ever wanted to do

Was to say goodbye to you

You say that I

I'm the one who's changed

But I can't keep on

Living life this way

You say that I

I'm the one who's changed

I'll find another you another way
