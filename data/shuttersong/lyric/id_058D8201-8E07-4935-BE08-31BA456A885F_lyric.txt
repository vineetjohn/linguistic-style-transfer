I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess

So I sat quietly
Agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point

I stood for nothing
So I fell for everything
You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, You hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up

Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
dancing through the fire
Cause I am a champion and
You're gonna hear me ROAR
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion and
You're gonna hear me ROAR

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar
Now I'm floating like a butterfly

Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero
You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, You hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up

Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
dancing through the fire
Cause I am a champion and
You're gonna hear me ROAR
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion and
You're gonna hear me ROAR

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

You're gonna hear me roar
Roar-or, roar-or, roar-or
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
dancing through the fire
Cause I am a champion and
You're gonna hear me ROAR
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion and
You're gonna hear me ROAR
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar
