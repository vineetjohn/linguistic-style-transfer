Girl, tell me what you're doing on the other side
And so, just tell me what you're doing with that other guy
Cos' I ain't got patience to slow down the bass
All your girlfriends are wasted
They need it, they chase it
Face it; you want it, you crave it

Believe when I say that you'll know once you taste it
All of your friends have been here for too long
They must be waiting for you to move on

Girl, I'm not with it I'm way too far gone
I'm not ready, eyes heavy now
Heart on your sleeve like you've never been loved
Running in circles, now look what you've done
Give you my word as you take it and run
Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now
Took me some time and space to realize
That you, were busy lying, sleeping 'round with other guys

And what the hell were we?
Tell me we weren't just friends
This doesn't make much sense, no
But I'm not hurt, I'm tense
Cos' I'll be fine without you babe

All of your friends have been here for too long
They must be waiting for you to move on
Girl, I'm not with it I'm way too far gone
I'm not ready, eyes heavy now
Heart on your sleeve like you've never been loved
Running in circles, now look what you've done
Give you my word as you take it and run
Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now

(wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now)
(I'm not ready, eyes heavy now)
