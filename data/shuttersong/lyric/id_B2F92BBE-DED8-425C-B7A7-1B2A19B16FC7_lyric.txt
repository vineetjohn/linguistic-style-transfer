"Suffer"

Torna-tornado
Baby, you... you blow my mind
You'll tell me wait, wait on ya
But, baby, I can't wait all night
I go through pictures you send my phone
Oh, stop tempting me
You know what I want

I wanna make... wanna make love
Girl, I can't lie

I'm just a sucker
For a cold-hearted lover
You make me suffer
You make me suffer
Don't keep me waiting
You should come over
Don't make me suffer
Don't make me suffer

So here we go, go again
It's like I'm caught under your spell
You're wearing black, black magic
Well, baby, don't wear nothing else
When I open up this door, don't you play
Ain't no other man going to make you feel the same

I wanna make, wanna make love
Girl, I can't lie

I'm just a sucker
For a cold hearted lover
You make me suffer
You make me suffer
Don't keep me waiting
You should come over
Don't make me suffer
Don't make me suffer

I hate it when
You get your way
But we love, yeah, we love it, baby
So please don't ever change
You make me suffer, baby
You, oh

I'm just a sucker
For a cold-hearted lover
You make me suffer
You make me suffer
Don't keep me waiting
You should come over
Don't make me suffer
Don't make me suffer
