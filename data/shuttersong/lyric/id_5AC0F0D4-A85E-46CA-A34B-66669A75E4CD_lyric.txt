Who the fuck do you think I am?
You ain't married to no average bitch boy
You can watch my fat ass twist boy

And keep your money, I got my own
Get a bigger smile on my face, being alone

Fuck you hater, you can't recreate her no
You'll never recreate her no... Hell no

Beautiful mane I'm the lion

Blindly in love, I fucks with you
'Til I realize, I'm just too much for you
