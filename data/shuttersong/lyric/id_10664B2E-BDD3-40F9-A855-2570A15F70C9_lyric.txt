A friend gave me your number
To tell you watch your lover’s tracks
See I always kind of liked you
So, I wanna have your back
There is a good chance by the time you hear this
The story’s gonna say
That I came on to him
But it was never quite that way

I knew he was good looking
Maybe too good to be true
But when he kissed me in that alley
I could tell there was a you

I don’t want to be that girl
With your guy
To fool you
Make you cry
Wreck it all
For one night
To be with him when he should be with you
I don’t want all the dirty looks
The headlines
So, I called you
To explain why
I wound up
With your guy
When I don’t wanna be that girl

I know boys can be promiscuous
Yeah, that’s just what they do
But this involves the both of us
Yeah, it’s our business too
So, I thought I’d call to tell you
It was never in my plan
I’m not the scarlet Devil
I don’t want to take your man

Imagine how surprised I was
When he got up to leave
It wasn’t my name on his lips
No, he didn’t call for me
He didn’t say, Jolene

I don’t want to be that girl
With your guy
To fool you
Make you cry
Wreck it all
For one night
To be with him when he should be with you
I don’t want all the dirty looks
The headlines
So, I called you
To explain why
I wound up
With your guy
When I don’t wanna be that girl

We all know how the moral of the story goes
Be careful what you reap because you reap what you sow
I’m calling ’cause I really thought you should know
Even though he’s being that guy

I don’t want to be that girl
With your guy
To fool you
Make you cry
Wreck it all
For one night
To be with him when he should be with you
I don’t want all the dirty looks
The headlines
So, I called you
To explain why
I wound up
With your guy
When I don’t wanna be that girl
