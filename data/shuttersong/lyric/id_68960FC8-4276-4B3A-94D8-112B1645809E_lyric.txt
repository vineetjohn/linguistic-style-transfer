Since the day, you gave your love to me
Oh, I confess I need it constantly
No remedy could ever cure
This pain you have on me
So I'm yours, my dear
Until eternity, it's you or me

(Hooked for life, hooked for life)
For your love I'm makin' a sacrifice
Like a man with a monkey on his back I'm hooked for life
(Hooked for life)

I'm hooked for life, hooked for life
For your love I'm makin' a sacrifice
Like a man with a monkey on his back I'm hooked for life, yeah
(Hooked for life)

It's alright

People say, ooh, that you're no good for me

All they can see I'm chained and vowed
To this new love I've found
I'll be round
'Til I'm put in a clown, you're safe and sound

(Hooked for life, hooked for life)
Told you baby, yeah
Like a man with a monkey on his back I'm hooked for life
(Hooked for life)

(Hooked for life, hooked for life)
Like a man with a monkey on his back I'm hooked for life
(Hooked for life)

(Hooked for life, hooked for life)
For your love I'm makin' a sacrifice
Like a man with a monkey on his back I'm hooked for life, yes, I am
(Hooked for life)

(Hooked for life, hooked for life)
For your love I'm makin' a sacrifice
Like a man with a monkey on his back I'm hooked for life
(Hooked for life)

(Hooked for life, hooked for life)
Can't you see, just you and me
We together 'till eternity
(Hooked for life)

(Hooked for life, hooked for life)
There's no remedy
