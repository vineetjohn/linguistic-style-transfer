 don't you dare look  back
just keep your eyes on me.
I said your holding  back,
She said shut up and dance with me!
This woman is my destiny
She said oh oh oh
Shut up and dance with me
We were victims of the night,
The chemical, physical, kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and faded light
Oh we were born to get together,
born to get together.
She took my arm,
I  don 't know how it happened.
We took the floor and she said
Oh  don 't  you  dare look  back
just keep your eyes on me.
I said your holding  back,
She said shut up and dance with me!
This woman is my destiny
She said oh oh oh
Shut up and dance with me
A backless dress and some beat up sneaks,
My disco tec Juliet teenage dream.
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me.
I knew we were born to be together,
born to be together
She took my arm,
I  don 't know how it happened.
We took the floor and she said
Oh  don 't  you  dare look  back
just keep your eyes on me.
I said your holding  back,
She said shut up and dance with me!
This woman is my destiny
She said oh oh oh
Shut up and dance with me
Deep in her eyes,
I think i see the future.
I realize this is my last chance.
She took my arm,
I  don 't know how it happened.
We took the floor and she said
Oh  don 't  you  dare look  back
just keep your eyes on me.
I said your holding  back,
She said shut up and dance with me!
This woman is my destiny
She said oh oh oh
Shut up and dance!
Oh  don 't  you  dare look  back
just keep your eyes on me.
I said your holding  back,
She said shut up and dance with me!
This woman is my destiny
She said oh oh oh
Shut up and dance with me
oh oh oh shut up dance with me
