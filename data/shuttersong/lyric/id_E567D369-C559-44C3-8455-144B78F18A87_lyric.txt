Control - Halsey
They send me away to find them a fortune
A chest filled with diamonds and gold
The house was awake
With shadows and monsters
The hallways they echoed and groaned
I sat alone in bed 'til the morning
I'm crying they're coming for me
And I tried to hold these secrets inside me
My mind's like a deadly disease
I'm bigger than my body
I'm colder than this home
I'm meaner than my demons
I'm bigger than these bones
And all the kids cried out
Please stop you're scaring me
I can't help this awful energy
Goddamn right you should be scared of me
Who is in control
I paced around for hours I'm empty
I jumped at the slightest of sounds
And I couldn't stand the person inside me
I turned all the mirrors around
I'm bigger than my body
I'm colder than this home
I'm meaner than my demons
I'm bigger than these bones
And all the kids cried out
Please stop you're scaring me
I can't help this awful energy
Goddamn right you should be scared of me
Who is in control
I'm well acquainted
With villains that live in my bed
They beg me to write them
So they'll never die when I'm dead
And I've grown familiar
With villains that live in my head
They beg me to write them
So I'll never die when I'm dead
I'm bigger than my body
I'm colder than this home
I'm meaner than my demons
I'm bigger than these bones
And all the kids cried out
Please stop you're scaring me
I can't help this awful energy
Goddamn right you should be scared of me
Who is in control
And all the kids cried out
Please stop you're scaring me
I can't help this awful energy
Goddamn right you should be scared of me
Who is in control
