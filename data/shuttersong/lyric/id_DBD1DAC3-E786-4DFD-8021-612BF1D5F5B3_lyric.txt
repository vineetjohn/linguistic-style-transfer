She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

I've been feeling foolish
You should try it
She came and substituted
The peace and quiet for
Acrobatic blood, flow, concertina
Cheating heartbeat, rapid fire

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

Hear who's your host
Sounds as if she's pretty close
When the heat starts growing horns
She's thunderstorms

She's been loop the looping
Around my mind
Her motorcycle boots
Give me this kind of
Acrobatic blood, concertina
Cheating heartbeat, rapid fire

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

In an unusual place
When you're feeling far away
She does what the night does to the day
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
Thunderstorms
