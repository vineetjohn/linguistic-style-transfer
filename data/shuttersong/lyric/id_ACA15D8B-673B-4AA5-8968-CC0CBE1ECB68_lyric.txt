Honey you are a rock
Upon which I stand
& I come here to talk
I hope you understand

The green eyes
Yeah, the spotlight shines upon you
& how could
Anybody deny you?

I came here with a load
& it feels so much lighter now I've met you
& honey you should know
That I could never go on without you

Green eyes

Honey you are the sea
Upon which I float
& I came here to talk
I think you should know

The green eyes
You're the one that I wanted to find
& anyone who
Tried to deny you must be out of their minds

'Cause I came here with a load
& it feels so much lighter since I met you
Honey, you should know
That I could never go on without you

Green eyes, green eyes
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Honey, you are a rock
Upon which I stand
