Ask me what I did with my life
I spent to you
If I lose my fame and fortune
(Really don't matter)
As long as I got you, baby

Clap your hands, y'all it's alright
Clap your hands, y'all it's alright
Clap your hands, y'all it's alright
As long as I got you, baby

Clap your hands, y'all it's alright
Clap your hands, y'all it's alright
Clap your hands, y'all it's alright
As long as I got you
