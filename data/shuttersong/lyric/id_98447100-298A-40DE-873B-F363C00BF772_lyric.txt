It's 5 o' clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
 You said you'd go into bed soon

So I snuck off to your bedroom

And I thought I'd just wait there

Until I heard you come up the stairs

And I pretended I was sleepin and I was hoping¡­

 
It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and I want ya

And you want me, don't ya?

I can see it

Cause you've been waiting on me since

I said that I was hittin' the club

Something coming up on me

And I know you be getting so horny

Cause you be sending me texts

Like boy just get your ass up in that car

And come get all of this love

 
You ain't got to remind me

She already said if I don't come home on time

She might go crazy

And she'll be waiting on me naked

With one of my chains on

She might come and find me

And then ask me kindly

 
Do I want her to go crazy?

We do this every night

And then we always wake up singing the same song

 
It's 5 o' clock in the morning

And you calling

And these females got me stalling

I can hear your voice in my head like

What is he doing? oh what is he doing?

Cause I keep checking my cell phone

And these missed calls

You texting me like I'mma kill y'all

If you don't get your ass up out of that club

And you do know what time it is

It's 5 o'clock in the morning

On my bed, girl

And this Nuvo got me trippin

And I know that you mad, girl

But you ain't got to worry about nothing

Girl I got you, girl I got you

She might come and find me, and then ask me kindly

Do I want her to go crazy

Too many thirsty girls up in this club for me to

Leave here with one of them

That's why I call her

And you'll be right at home waiting for me

Iphone plugged in the wall, just waiting for me

Club closed at 6, left around 4:30
