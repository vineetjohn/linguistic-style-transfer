I'm gonna love ya
Like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya
When no one would
Cause I swear you deserve so good

Living up in California
Loving life that I've been waiting for ya
Please my dear don't turn my face
Oh God I hope it's not too late

I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya
Like no one could
I'm gonna love ya
Like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya
When no one would
Cause I swear you deserve so good

Sometimes it's hard to have the upper hand
When every dream you have is turning into sand
You need someone to make your game
But he took your breath and blew it away

I'm gonna love ya
Like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya
When no one would
Cause I swear you deserve so good

I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya
Like no one could
I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya
Like no one could

I'm gonna love ya
Like he never could
Cause i know you deserve so good
