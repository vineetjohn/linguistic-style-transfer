I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I know I let you down didn't I
So many sleepless nights
Where you were waiting up on me
Well I'm just a slave unto the night
Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me
Remember when I broke you down to tears
I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years
So I I bet my life I bet my life
I bet my life on you
I I bet my life I bet my life
I bet my life on you
I've been around the world but never in my wildest dreams
Would I come running home to you
I've told a million lies
But now I tell a single truth
There's you in everything I do
Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me
Remember when I broke you down to tears
I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years
So I I bet my life I bet my life
I bet my life on you
I I bet my life I bet my life
I bet my life on you
Don't tell me that I'm wrong
I've walked that road before
I left you on your own
And please believe them when they say
That it's left me yesterday
And the records that I've played
Please forgive me for all I've done
So I I bet my life I bet my life
I bet my life on you
I I bet my life I bet my life
I bet my life on you
I
I bet my
I bet my
I bet my
I
I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my life on you
