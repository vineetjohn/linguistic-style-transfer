It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh uh uh uh

It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, uh uh uh uh

Yeaaaah
We're happy free confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh-yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, uh uh

I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22, 22

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded too many cool kids
(Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ugh)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming instead of sleeping

Yeaaaah
We're happy free confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh-yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, uh uh

I don't know about you but im feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22, 22
I don't know about you 22, 22
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping

It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news, I gotta have you, I gotta have you

I don't know about you but im feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22, 22

Dancing like 22
Yeah, 22, yeah yeah

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping

It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news I gotta have you, I gotta have you
