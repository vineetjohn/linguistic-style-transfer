I'll have a shower
And then phone my brother up
Within the hour
I'll smash another cup
Please don't start saying that
Or I'll start believing you
If I start believing you
I'll know that this party fears two
And what if this party fears two?
The alcohol loves you while turning you blue
View it from here
From closer to near, awake me
Don't turn around
I won't have to look at you
And what's not found
Is all that I see in you
My manners are failing me
I'm left feeling ugly
And you say it's wonderful
To live with I never will
So what if this party fears two?
The alcohol loves you while turning you blue
View it from here
From closer to near, awake me
I'm standing still
And you say I dress too well
Still standing still
I might but it's hard to tell
Even a slight remark
Makes nonsense and turns to shark
Have I done something wrong?
What's wrong's the wrong that's always in wrong
I'll have a shower
And then phone my brother up
Within the hour
I'll smash another cup
