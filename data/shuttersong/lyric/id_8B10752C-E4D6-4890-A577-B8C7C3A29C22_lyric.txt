Looking you over and you don't know my name yet
But by the time you looked away, already knew I couldn't fake it

I got this need for you, forming in my beating heart
I knew the meaning right away, we only yesterday were worlds apart

I think I may love you
If you give me some time
Maybe you'll love me too

I got this thing for you
If you come closer I can whisper in your ear
And if you wanna walk away
I'll tell you all the things I know you wanna hear

I'll come closer to you
If you come over
I know we'll go farther
Farther with you
With you i'm in warm water swimming down

I think I may love you
If you give me some time
Maybe you'll love me too

I'll come closer to you
If you come over
I know we'll go farther
Farther with you
With you i'm in warm water swimming down
I'll come closer
To you if you
Come over
I know we'll go farther
Farther with you
With you i'm in warm water swimming down
