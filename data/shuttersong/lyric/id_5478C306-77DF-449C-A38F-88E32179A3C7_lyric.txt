Kill Em With Kindness	
	
ÑÝ³ª£ºSelena Gomez	
	
The world can be a nasty place	
You know it I know it yeah	
	
We don't have to fall from grace	
	
Put down the weapons you fight with	
	
Kill 'em with kindness	
	
Kill 'em with kindness	
Kill 'em kill 'em kill 'em with kindness	
	
Kill 'em with kindness	
	
Kill 'em with kindness	
Go ahead go ahead go ahead now	
	
We're running out of time	
Chasing our lies	
Everyday a small piece of you dies	
	
Always somebody	
You're willing to fight to be right	
	
Your lies are bullets	
Your mouth's a gun	
	
And no war and anger	
	
Was ever won	
	
Put out the fire before igniting	
	
Next time you're fighting	
	
Kill 'em with kindness	
	
Kill 'em with kindness	
	
Kill 'em kill 'em kill 'em with kindness	
	
Kill 'em with kindness	
	
Kill 'em with kindness	
	
Go ahead go ahead go ahead now	
	
Go ahead go ahead now	
	
Go ahead go ahead now	
	
Your lies are bullets	
Your mouth's a gun	
	
No war and anger	
	
Was ever won	
	
Put out the fire before igniting	
	
Next time you're fighting	
	
Kill 'em with kindness	
	
Kill 'em with kindness	
	
Kill 'em kill 'em kill 'em with kindness	
	
Kill 'em with kindness	
	
Kill 'em with kindness	
	
Go ahead go ahead go ahead now	
	
Go ahead go ahead now	
	
Go ahead go ahead now	
	
Go ahead go ahead now
