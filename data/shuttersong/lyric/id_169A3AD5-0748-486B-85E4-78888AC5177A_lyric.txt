Reload (Vocal Version) (Radio Edit) - Sebastian Ingrosso
When night has become the day
They're sending you far away
So  so far away
When everything starts to fade
You don't have to be afraid
No  you don't have to be afraid
Take my hand and
Reload
This is free love
That's what we are made of
Yes  we are  are  are
Reload
This is free love
That's what we are made of
Yes  we are  are  are
When you wanna get off the ground
But gravity pulls you down
Gravity pulls you down
And when you feel out of place
You don't have to be afraid
No  you don't have to be afraid
Take my hand and
Reload
This is free love
That's what we are made of
Yes  we are  are  are
Reload
This is free love
That's what we are made of
Yes  we are  are  are
Yes  we are  are  are are are are
Yes  we are 
Yes  we are  are  are
Yes  we are  are  are
