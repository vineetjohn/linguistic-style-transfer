Why?
Who me?
Why?

Feet, don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line

Oh, my heart, it breaks
Every step that I take
But I'm hoping at the gates
They'll tell me that you're mine

Walking through the city streets
Is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey

Don't make me sad
Don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough
And the road gets tough
I don't know why

Keep making me laugh
Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

Choose your last words
This is the last time
'Cause you and I
We were born to die

Lost, but now I am found
I can see, but once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Trying to take what I could get
Scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey

Don't make me sad
Don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough
And the road gets tough
I don't know why

Keep making me laugh
Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

Choose your last words
This is the last time
'Cause you and I
We were born to die

(We were born to die, we were born)
(We were born to die)
We were born to die
(We were born to die, we were born)
(We were born to die)
We were born to die

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

Don't make me sad
Don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough
And the road gets tough
I don't know why

Keep making me laugh
Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

Choose your last words
This is the last time
'Cause you and I
We were born to die

(We were born to die, we were born)
(We were born to die)
We were born to die
