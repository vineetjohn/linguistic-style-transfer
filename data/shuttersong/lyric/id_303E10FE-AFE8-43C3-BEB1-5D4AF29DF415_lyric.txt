When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you - all the way
Happy to be near you
When you need someone to cheer you - all the way
Taller than the tallest tree is

That's how its got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes - if it's real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you - all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years - come what may
Who knows where the road will lead us?
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you - all the way, all the way
