They would yell, they would scream, they were fighting it out
She would hope, she would pray, she was waiting it out
Holding onto a dream while she watches these walls fall down
Sharp words like knives, they were cutting her down
Shattered glass like the past, it's a memory now
Holding onto a dream while she watches these walls fall down

Hey mom, hey dad, when did this end?
Where did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Who's right, who's wrong, who really cares?
The fault, the blame, the pain's still there
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
This broken home

Wrote it down on the walls, she was screaming it out
Made it clear, she's still here, are you listening now?
Just a ghost in the halls feeling empty, they're vacant now
All the battles, all the wars, all the times that you've fought
She's a scar, she's the bruise and she's the pain that you brought
There was life, there was love like a light and it's fading out

Hey mom, hey dad, when did this end?
Where did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Who's right, who's wrong, who really cares?
The fault, the blame, the pain's still there
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
This broken home

You've gotta let it go
You're losing all your hope
Nothing left to hold
Locked out in the cold
Your painted memories, that washed out all the seas
I'm stuck in between a nightmare and lost dream

Hey mom, hey dad, when did this end?
Where did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home

Hey mom, hey dad, when did this end?
Where did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Who's right, who's wrong, who really cares?
The fault, the blame, the pain's still there
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
This broken home
