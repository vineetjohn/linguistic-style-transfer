Whoa

I want to paint down my memories
So I don't forget
Can we dance when it's cold outside?
Can we live with no regrets?
So many people get caught up in everything they see
You can always trust what you believe

Sometimes I feel stuck
Sometimes I get lost in so much hope I'm drowning

Would you save me a spark?
(Oh-Whoa)
We'll start a fire that shines a light in the dark
Strike a match
Make it last
We are all we need
(Whoa)
Would you save me a spark?

We'll light up the dark
We'll light up the dark
I wanna crash like a tidal wave
Sink to the ocean floor
I want to stand in a crowded room
Screaming the voice they can't ignore
While everyone is sleeping

I am wide awake
Cause hearts are only open when they break

Sometimes I feel stuck
Sometimes I get lost in so much hope I'm drowning
Would you save me a spark?
(Oh-Whoa)
We'll start a fire that shines a light in the dark
Strike a match
Make it last

We are all we need
(Whoa)
Would you save me a spark?
We'll light up the dark
Let me see you light up the dark (Whoa)

I want to see you light up the dark (Whoa)
I wanna see you light up the dark
While everyone is sleeping
We'll be wide awake
(we'll be wide awake)
Would you save me a spark?
(Oh-Whoa)
We'll start a fire that shines a light in the dark
Strike a match
Make it last
We are all we need
(Whoa)
Would you save me a spark?
I want to paint down my memories
So I don't forget
Can we dance when it's cold outside?
Can we live with no regrets?
Strike a match
Make it last
Cause we are all we need
(Whoa)
Would you save me a spark?
We'll light up the dark
We'll light up the dark
We'll light up the dark
