Pretty Hurts - Beyonc¨¦
Mr  third world  your first question
What is your aspiration in life 
Oh  my aspiration in life
Would be to be happy
Mama said  you're a pretty girl
What's in your head  it doesn't matter
Brush your hair  fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters
Just another stage  pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down  down
Pretty hurts  shine the light on whatever's worse
Perfection is a disease of a nation  pretty hurts  pretty hurts
Pretty hurts  shine the light on whatever's worse
Trying to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery
Blonder hair  flat chest
TV says bigger is better
South beach  sugar free
Vogue says thinner is better
Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down  down  down
Pretty hurts  shine the light on whatever's worse
Perfection is a disease of a nation  pretty hurts  pretty hurts (Pretty hurts)
Pretty hurts (pretty hurts)  shine the light on whatever's worse
Trying to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery
Ain't got no doctor  no computer can take the pain away
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul  it's the soul that needs surgery
It's my soul that needs surgery
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
And you break when the paper sign leaves you in the dark
You left a shattered mirror and the shards of a beautiful girl
Pretty hurts  shine the light on whatever's worse (pretty hurts)
Perfection is a disease of a nation  pretty hurts  pretty hurts
Pretty hurts  shine the light on whatever's worse
Trying to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery
When you're alone all by yourself
And you're lying in your bed
Reflection stares right into you
Are you happy with yourself
It's just a way to masquerade
The illusion that's been shed
Are you happy with yourself 
Are you happy with yourself   yes
