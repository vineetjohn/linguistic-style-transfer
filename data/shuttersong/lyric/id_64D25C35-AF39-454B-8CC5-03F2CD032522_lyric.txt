Yeah
You're my right hand, you're my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will

But I swear you gotta chill
You wanna grip a Benz wheel
And I know you can't wait
You dream big and sleep late
You got a lot on your plate
That's why you're always working out
Taking pictures of yourself
You don't see anybody else
And you're like oh well
You're like fuck it oh well

My past behind me like a pony tail

But you're my right hand, you're my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Yeah
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
Yeah
And they never will

Ok I know you want the Audi
I know you want to go to Maui
You and all your girlfriends
The ones you never bring around me
Cause you don't trust me like your last man
Did he open doors for ya?
Buy the things he can't afford for ya
Cause he must have did a lot for ya
I just fell back with it
And now your past is behind you
Like the car with the strap in it
Thank god that's finished
Cause now it's back to business
Any more henny and you're past the limit

You told me about the picture
Now you have to send it
I would never put you on blast when I get it

You're my right hand, you're my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Yeah
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will

You're my right hand, you're my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will
