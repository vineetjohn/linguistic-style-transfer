Baby, can't you see
I'm calling
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous
I'm falling
There's no escape
I can't wait

I need a hit
Baby, give me it
You're dangerous
I'm loving it
Too high Can't come down
Losin' my head
Spinnin' 'round and 'round

Do you feel me now?
With the taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under (Ohh Ohh)
With a taste of the poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?

And I love what you do

Don't you know that you're toxic?
It's getting late
To give you up
I took a sip
From my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me

Too high Can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?
With the taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With the taste of the poison paradise

I'm addicted to you

Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Ahhhh...
Taste of your lips I'm on a ride

You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With a the taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
With the taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under (Toxic)
With the taste of the poison paradise

I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
(I think I'm ready now)
Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
