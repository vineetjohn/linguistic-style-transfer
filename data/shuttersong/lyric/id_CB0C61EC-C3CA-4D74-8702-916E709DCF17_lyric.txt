I know that we just met
Maybe this is dumb
But it feels like there was something from the moment that we touched
'Cause its alright, its alright
I wanna make you mine

The way you're lighting up the room
Caught the corner of my eye
We can both sneak out the back door
We don't have to say goodbye
'Cause its alright, its alright
To waste time tonight

Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby
If this is what it's like falling in love
Then I don't ever wanna grow up
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby
It'd be cool if it's the two of us
But I don't ever wanna grow up

'Cause I got it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
All, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And I got it all

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
And I don't ever wanna grow up
said, Your place is kinda close
Your 'rents are out of town
Baby, there's no pressure
But if you're down, I'm down

'Cause its alright, its alright
To just talk tonight
But if you're feeling kinda crazy
Turn down the lights
We can take our time
Do whatever you like

It's alright, its alright
I wanna make you mine
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby
If this is what it's like falling in love
Then I don't ever wanna grow up
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby

It'd be fun if it's the two of us
But I don't ever wanna grow up
'Cause I got it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

All, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And I got it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
And I don't ever wanna grow up

'Cause I got it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, all
And I got it all oh oh
And I don't ever wanna grow up

You make me feel
Like I got it all, yeah
And you make me feel
Like I'm just a kid in love
And you make me feel
Like I got it all
And you make me feel
Like I don't ever wanna grow up
Maybe we're just kids in love
Maybe we're just kids in love

Oh, baby
This is what it's like falling in love
Then we don't ever have to grow up
And maybe we're just kids in love
Maybe we're just kids in love
Oh, baby
When we're alone and it's the two of us
I can't get enough
I've got it all, yeah
I got it all, yeah
And I've got it, and I've got it all
And I've got it, and we've got it all
And I've got it, and I've got it all
But I don't ever wanna grow up
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
