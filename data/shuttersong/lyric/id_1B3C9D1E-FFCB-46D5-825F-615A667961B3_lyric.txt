I've been everywhere, man
Looking for someone
Someone who can please me
Love me all night long
I've been everywhere, man
Looking for you, babe
Looking for you, babe
Searching for you, babe
Where have you been
Cause I never see you out
Are you hiding from me, yeah?
Somewhere in the crowd
Where have you been
All my life, all my life
Where have you been, all my life
