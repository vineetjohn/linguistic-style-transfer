 I know you're happy,  cause I can see it
So tell the voice inside ya' head to believe it
 I talked to God about  you, he said he sent  you an angel
And look at all what he gave  you
 You asked for one and  you got two
 You  know  I never left  you
 Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside  you
So  I  can say
Hello my only one, just like the morning sun
 You'll keep on rising till the sky  knows your name
Hello my only one, remember who  you  are
No  you 're not perfect but  you 're not your mistakes
Hey hey hey hey
Oh the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Remember how  I'd say
Hey hey one day  you'll be the man  you always knew  you could be
And if  you knew how proud  I was
 You'd never shed a tear have a fear no  you wouldn't do that
And though  I didn't pick the day to turn the page
 I  know it's not the end every time  I see her face and  I hear  you say
Hello my only one, remember...
 You got the world  cause  you got love in your hands
And  you 're still my chosen one
So keep on... one day  you'll understand
So hear me out hear me out  I won't go  I won't go no goodbyes no goodbyes just hello just hello
And when  you cry  I will cry and when  you smile  I will smile
And next time when  I look in your eyes we'll have wings and we'll fly
Hello my only one, just like the morning sun
 You'll keep on rising till the sky  knows your name
And  you 're still my chosen one, remember who  you  are
No  you 're not perfect but  you 're not your mistakes
Hey hey hey hey
