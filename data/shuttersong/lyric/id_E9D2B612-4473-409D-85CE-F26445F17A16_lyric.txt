Can't touch this
Can't touch this
Can't touch this (oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh)
Can't touch this (oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh)
My-my-my-my music hits me so hard makes me say oh my Lord
Thank you for blessing me with a mind to rhyme and two hyped feet
It feels good when you know you're down
A superdope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat uh u can't touch
I told you homeboy u can't touch this
Yeah that's how living and we're you know u can't touch this
Look in my eyes man u can't touch this
You know let me bust the funky lyrics u can't touch this
Fresh new kicks and pants
You got it like that now you know you wanna dance
So move out of your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rolling hold on pump little bita 
And let me know it's going on like that like that
Cold on a mission so pull on back
Let you know that you're too much
And this is a beat uh u can't touch
Yo I told you u can't touch this
Why you standing there man  u can't touch this
Yo sound the bells school is in sucka u can't touch this
me a song Give or rhythm
Making em sweat that's what I'm giving 'em
Now they know when you the Hammertalk about 
You talk about a show that's hyped and tight
Singers are sweating so pass them a mic
Or a tape to learn what it's gonna take
And now he's gonna burn
The charts legit either work hard
Or you might as well quit
That's word because you know
U can't touch this (oh-oh oh oh-oh-oh)
U can't touch this (oh-oh oh oh-oh-oh)
Break it down
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh oh)
Stop Hammer time
Go with the flow in a sin if you can't move to this
Then you probably are dead
So wave your hands in the air
Bust throught the moves run your fingers through your hair
This is it  for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump
Bump bump bump yeeeah
U can't touch this
Look man  u can't touch this
You'll probably get hyped boy
'Cause you know you can't  u can't touch this
Ring the bell school's back in   break it down
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Stop  Hammer time
(Oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh) u can't touch this
(Oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh) break it down
(Oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh) stop Hammer time
Every time you see me the Hammer's just so hype
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic
Now why would I ever  stop doing this
With others making records that just don't hit
I toured around the world from London to the BAY
It's Hammer go Hammer
Mc hammer yo hammer and the rest can go and play
U can't touch this (oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh)
U can't touch this (oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh)
U can't touch this (oh-oh oh-oh-oh)
Yeah u can't touch this
I told you u can't touch this (oh-oh oh-oh-oh)
Too hype can't touch this
Yo  get me outta here u can't touch this
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
