She says she met me on a tour, She keeps knocking on my door

She won't leave me, leave me alone, This girl she wouldn't stop, almost had to call
the cops
She was scheming, ooh, she was wrong, Cause she wanted all my attention, hey
And she was dragging my name through the dirt, no
She was dying for my affection, But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her
I'm talking to you
Maria, Why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby, no, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?

She ain't my baby, no, she ain't my girl
Cause she talking in, and she needs to quit, Cause I never hit it, all I know she's
not mine
That ain't my baby (that's not my baby), that ain't my girl
'Cause she's wildin' out, what she talking about? Let me tell you now this girl
she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
Now she's in the magazines, on TV, making a scene
Oh she's crazy, crazy in love

And she's all over the news, saying everything but the truth, She's faking, faking

it all
Cause she wanted all my attention, hey
And she was dragging my name through the dirt, no
She was dying for my affection, But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her
