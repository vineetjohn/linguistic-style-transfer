Loving you
Isn't the right thing to do
How can I
Ever change things that I feel
If I could
Baby, I'd give you my world
How can I
When you won't take it from me

(you can go your own way)
Go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
(you can go your own way)
Go your own way

Tell me why
Everything turned around
Packing up
Shacking up's all you wanna do
If I could
Baby, I'd give you my world
Open up
Everything's waiting for you

(you can go your own way)
Go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
(you can go your own way)
Go your own way

(you can go your own way)
Go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
Another lonely day
(you can go your own way)
Go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way
