You always verbalize
The doubts I wanna hide
My dreams get criticized
But you're just a voice in my mind

But you're not getting in my way

So shut up move on, stop saying what you want for me
I'll live my life at 100,000 feet
I'm tired of all your words, my actions speak louder to me 
Don't make a sound

Just shut up, shut up

The noise gets me tongue tied
Coz I don't believe in your lies
No space to compromise
Gonna see the world through my own eyes

And nothing's getting in my way

So, shut up move on, stop saying what you want for me
I'll live my life at 100,000 feet
I'm tired of all your words, my actions speak louder to me 
Don't make a sound

Just shut up, shut up, 
Just shut up, shut up

You say I'm not a kite I'll fly
You say I'm not a star I'll shine
You think I'm wrong, I know I'm right
(I'm my own mind)

Shut up

I'm tired of all your words, my actions speak louder to me
Don't make a sound

So shut up, lets get on, start dreaming up my dreams with me
Let's take a leap of faith from 100,000 feet
I'm done with all these words, coz actions speak louder to me 
Don't make a sound

Just shut up, shut up, just shut up, shut up
(I'm my own mind)

You say I'm not a kite I'll fly
You say I'm not a star I'll shine
You think I'm wrong, I know I'm right
I'm my own mind
