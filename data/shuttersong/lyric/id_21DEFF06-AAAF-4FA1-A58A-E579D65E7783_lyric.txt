There's a city in my mind, come along and take that ride, and it's all right, baby, it's all right
And it's very far away, but it's growing day by day, and it's all right, baby, it's all right
Well, we know where we're going, but we don't know where we've been
And we know what we're knowing, but we can't say what we've seen
And we're not little children, and we know what we want
And the future is certain, give us time to work it out

Yeah

We're on a road to nowhere, come on inside
We'll take that ride to nowhere, we'll take that ride
Feeling okay this morning, and you know
We're on a road to paradise, here we go, here we go

We're on a ride to nowhere, come on inside
Taking that ride to nowhere, we'll take that ride
Maybe you'll wonder where you are, I don't care
Even when time is on our side, take you there, take you there

We're on a road to nowhere, ha, ha
We're on a road to nowhere, ha, ha
We're on a road to nowhere, ha, ha, whoo

There's a city in my mind, come along and take that ride, and it's all right, baby, it's all right
And it's very far away, but it's growing day by day, and it's all right, baby, it's all right
Would you like to come along, you can help me sing this song, and it's all right, baby, it's all right
They can tell you what to do, but they'll make a fool of you, and it's all right, baby, it's all right
There's a city in my mind, come along and take that ride, and it's all right, baby, it's all right
And it's very far away, but it's growing day by day, and it's all right, baby, it's all right
Yeah, would you like to come along, you can help me sing this song, and it's all right, baby, it's all right
They can tell you what to do, oh, God, they'll make a fool of you, and it's all right, baby, it's all right

We're on a road to nowhere, hey
We're on a road to nowhere, ha
We're on a road to nowhere, ha, ha
We're on a road to nowhere
