Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss good night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
Fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
As long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

He doesn't care if it's in below
He's sitting by the fires glossy glow
He don't care about the cold and the winds that blow
He just says, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow

Ooh, wee, goes the storm
Why should he worry when he's nice and warm?
His girl by his side and the lights turned low
He just says, let it snow, let it snow
I don't care

Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But that fire is, mmm, delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought lots of corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
So, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow
When we finally say good night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll only hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
Fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
Long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
