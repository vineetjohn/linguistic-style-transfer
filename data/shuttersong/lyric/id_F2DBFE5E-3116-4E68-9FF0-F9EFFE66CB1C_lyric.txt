Everybody wanna know where you got your stuff

I keep a pedicured lawn so them snakes, they will be dead

Tears of joy run down my cheek onto the soil

I would trick off on your bitch but she ain't loyal

Nothin' but love for you niggas ridin' with no tint

Grand total 5 digits make these hoes repent

Popped a couple pills, I feel like Johnny Mad Dog

I lost a couple friends, I'm tryna get these bands, dog

You know we in this bitch, we throwin' up them grands, y'all

And once we hit the club we 'bout to go so ham, y'all

My comrades want them mils, my comrades want them millions

My comrades want the bills, my comrades want them billions

My comrades want the tri, my comrades want them trillions

Yeah we want more than racks, my comrades want them illions

Say my, say my, say my name

Twitchin' bitches and I'm switchin' lanes

When they call last shot for alcohol, I just wanna take my last drink

I just wanna sip some clean purp

Hit the car lot and just made a purchase

I just realized that I am a star, cruisin' my coupe up the boulevard

None of my pictures are watermarked

Got more water than a waterboard

I be on it draped me up, nigga

Yellow bone suck my nuts, nigga

She think it's chocolate but she call me papi

Papi Chulo, I'ma get it poppin'

Got some red bottoms on a hotty thotty

Put them heels knew karate

I just came in like a kamikaze

I just walk 'round like a zombie, daddy

I don't like bein' in paddy wagons

So no remorse, I'm about the fetti

Had a few horses come by the telly

Eating each other, they get some credit

Got commas on commas, I'm really ready

I'm really 'bout to pour up on a jet

I would never mention niggas names

Tell niggas nigga never did exist

These niggas Never ever been a thread

These niggas never get enough attention

I just put the bitch on punishment

I've been hangin' where the money been

I don't know what type of love is this

Can you tell me where my dogs at?

Put a hollow in your ball cap

What type of nigga you call that?

When I hang up on you, never call back

I'm a money counter, count my own money

Been Provin', you ain't ever goin' up

Every time you hit the club, you always fuck it up
