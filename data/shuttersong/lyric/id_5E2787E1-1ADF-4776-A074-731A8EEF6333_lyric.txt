?Stranger than the comet as it streaks across the sky 
Stranger than the truth I know before my open eyes 
I have dealt in mysteries and trickery  of light to entertain 
Looked into the abyss  called it by its name 
I have plundered time itself  put the world inside it 
I'm the mysteries  day and night divided 
A plague of wonders  on your knees beside me 
Know the secrets  you shall not deride us 
My dreams of empire from my frozen queen 
Will come to pass 
Know me  the Magus 
I am Dr  Dee 
And this is my house 
I am the master of the tides 
I shame the mirror in my sight 
What random music of the spheres 
Across the years 
Know this 
I will return to this land 
Rebuild where the ruins did stand 
Chain up the demons set free 
Strange alchemy 
 
Gather round the aimless and the feckless and the lame 
Hear the master summon up the spirits by their names 
I curse you Edward Kelly your betrayal for eternity is damned 
Know you speak with demons you cannot command 
Even as I looked into the glass  then I was blinded 
Burning by the Mortlake shore my house my books inside it 
You have taken up my wife and lain beside her 
Now the black rain on my house  the timbers burning 
My dreams of empire from my frozen queen 
Will come to pass 
Know me  the Magus 
I am Dr  Dee 
And this was my house 
I was the keeper of the books 
I had the knowledge of the scrolls 
But now through ignorance and fear 
I cast a shadow through the years 
Know this 
I will return to this land 
Rebuild where the ruins did stand 
Chain up the demons set free 
Strange alchemy 
 
Know this 
I will return to this land 
Rebuild where the ruins did stand 
Chain up the demons set free 
Strange alchemy 
Know this 
I will return to this land 
Rebuild where the ruins did stand 
Restore the knowledge memory 
Strange alchemy
