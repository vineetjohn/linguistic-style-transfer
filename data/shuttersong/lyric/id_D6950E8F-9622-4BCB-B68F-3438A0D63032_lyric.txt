No one laughs at God in a hospital
No one laughs at God in a war
No one¡¯s laughing at God
When they¡¯re starving or freezing or so very poor

No one laughs at God
When the doctor calls after some routine tests
No one¡¯s laughing at God
When it¡¯s gotten real late
And their kid¡¯s not back from the party yet

No one laughs at God
When their airplane start to uncontrollably shake
No one¡¯s laughing at God
When they see the one they love, hand in hand with someone else
And they hope that they¡¯re mistaken

No one laughs at God
When the cops knock on their door
And they say we got some bad news, sir
No one¡¯s laughing at God
When there¡¯s a famine or fire or flood

But God can be funny
At a cocktail party when listening to a good God-themed joke, or
Or when the crazies say He hates us
And they get so red in the head you think they¡¯re ¡®bout to choke
God can be funny,
When told he¡¯ll give you money if you just pray the right way
And when presented like a genie who does magic like Houdini
Or grants wishes like Jiminy Cricket and Santa Claus
God can be so hilarious
Ha ha
Ha ha

No one laughs at God in a hospital
No one laughs at God in a war
No one¡¯s laughing at God
When they¡¯ve lost all they¡¯ve got
And they don¡¯t know what for

No one laughs at God on the day they realize
That the last sight they¡¯ll ever see is a pair of hateful eyes
No one¡¯s laughing at God when they¡¯re saying their goodbyes
But God can be funny
At a cocktail party when listening to a good God-themed joke, or
Or when the crazies say He hates us
And they get so red in the head you think they¡¯re ¡®bout to choke
God can be funny,
When told he¡¯ll give you money if you just pray the right way
And when presented like a genie who does magic like Houdini
Or grants wishes like Jiminy Cricket and Santa Claus
God can be so hilarious

No one laughs at God in a hospital
No one laughs at God in a war
No one laughs at God in a hospital
No one laughs at God in a war
No one laughing at God in hospital
No one¡¯s laughing at God in a war
No one¡¯s laughing at God when they¡¯re starving or freezing or so very poor

No one¡¯s laughing at God
No one¡¯s laughing at God
No one¡¯s laughing at God
We¡¯re all laughing with God
