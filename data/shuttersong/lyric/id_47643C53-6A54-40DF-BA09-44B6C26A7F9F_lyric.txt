Double OT
I'm a new breed
Saucin', saucin', I'm saucin' on you
I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin' oh ooh
I'm ballin', I'm ballin', Iverson on you
Watch out, watch out, watch out, yeah
I smash out, I smash out, I smash out, yeah
Spendin', I'm spendin' all my fuckin' pay
I got me some braids and I got me some hoes
Started rockin' the sleeve, I can't ball with no joes
You know how I do it, Concords on my toes
(This shit is hard)
I ain't rich yet, but you know I ain't broke, I
So if I see it, I like it, buy that from the store, I
I'm with some white girls and they lovin' the coca
Like they're OT
Double OT like I'm KD, smokin' OG
And you know me, in my 2-3s and my gold teeth
Bet you're smiling, bet you see me from the nosebleeds
I'm the new 3 and I change out to my new 3s
White Iverson
When I started ballin' I was young
You gon' think about me when I'm gone
I need that money like the ring I never won, I won
Saucin', saucin', I'm saucin' on you
I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin' oh ooh
I'm ballin', I'm ballin', Iverson on you
Watch out, watch out, watch out, yeah
I smash out, I smash out, I smash out, yeah
Spendin', I'm spendin' all my fuckin' pay
Cigarettes and a headband
Commas, commas in my head, man
Slumped over like a dead man
Red and black, 'bout my bred, man
I'm the answer, never question
Lace up, learn a lesson
Bitch I'm saucin', I do this often, don't do no talkin'
My options right when I walk in, jump all them Jordans
I'm ballin', money jumpin'
Like I'm Davis from New Orleans
Or bitch I'm Harden, I don't miss nothin'
Fuck practice, this shit just happens, know y'all can't stand it
I have it, I'll never pass it, I wear my magic
High average, ball on these bastards, it makes me happy
It's tragic, I make it happen, and all y'all Shaqtin'
