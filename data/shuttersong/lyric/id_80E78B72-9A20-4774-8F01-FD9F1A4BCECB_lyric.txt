Hate, something, sometime, someway
Something kicked down the football
Mine, something inside.
I'll never ever follow.
So give... me... some... thing... that... is... for... real.
I'll never ever follow.

Get your boogie on.
Get your boogie on.

Hate, something, someway, each day
Feeling ripped off again no.
Why? This shit inside.
Now everyone will follow.
So give... me... noth... ing... just... feel.
And all the shit will follow.

God thanks me
The more I see the lie.
Who wants to see?
God told me
I've already Got The Life
Oh, I say...

God thanks me
They'll never see the light.
Didn't want us to see?
God told me
I've already Got The Life
Oh, I say...

Each day I can feel it swallow
Inside something torn from me
I don't feel your deathly ways
Each day I feel so hollow
Inside always beating me
You'll never see
So come dance with me.
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Me!

God thanks me
The more I see the lie.
Who wants to see?
God told me
I've already Got The Life
Oh, I say...

God thanks me
They'll never see the light.
Who wants to see?
God told me
I've already Got The Life.

Got The Life
Got The Life
Got The Life
Got The Life
Got The Life
Got The Life
Got The Life
Got The Life
Got The Life
