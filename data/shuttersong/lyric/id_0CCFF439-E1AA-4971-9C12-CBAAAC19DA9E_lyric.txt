Tell me baby what we're gonna do
I'll make it easy, got a lot to do
Watch the sun alight, coming true
Open the window, let it shine on you

Cause I've been sick and working all week
And I've been doing just fine
You've been tired of watching me
We've got to have a good time, boy
You can take it all these spaces
Never keeping it real
I know exactly how you feel

When you say you've had enough
And you might just give it up
Oh, oh
I will never let you down
When you feeling lone love
I'll be what you dreaming of
Oh, oh
I will never let you down

I will never let you down
Oh, oh
I will never let you down
Oh, oh
I will never let you down

There's a million ways to go
Don't be embarrassed if you lose control
On the rooftop, now you know
Your body's frozen and you lost your soul

Cause I've been sick and working all week
And I've been doing just fine
You've been tired of watching me
We've got to have a good time, boy
You can take it all these spaces
Never keeping it real
I know exactly how you feel

When you say you've had enough
And you might just give it up
Oh, oh
I will never let you down
When you feeling lone love
I'll be what you dreaming of
Oh, oh
I will never let you down

Oh, oh
I will never let you down
Oh, oh
I will never let you down

Let me take you where you never go
Have a little fun is the only we know
Let me show you what you never see
You're not hiding, love, only when you holding me

When you say you've had enough
And you might just give it up
Oh, oh
I will never let you down
When you feeling lone love
I'll be what you dreaming of
Oh, oh
I will never let you down

When you say you've had enough
And you might just give it up
Oh, oh
I will never let you down
When you feeling lone love
I'll be what you dreaming of
Oh, oh
I will never let you down
