Scared of my own image
Scared of my own immaturity
Scared of my own ceiling
Scared I'll die of uncertainty

Fear might be the death of me
Fear leads to anxiety
Don't know what's inside of me

Don't forget about me
Don't forget about me
Even when I doubt you
I'm no good without you

No, no.
Temperature is dropping
Temperature is dropping

I'm not sure if I can see this ever stopping
Shaking hands with the dark parts of my thoughts
No
You are all that I've got
No

Don't forget about me
Don't forget about me
Even when I doubt you

I'm no good without you ...
No, no, no, no, no.
Knowing all the Bishops
Claw our way up their system
Repeating simple phrases someone Holy insisted
Want the markings made on my skin to mean something to me again
Hope you haven't left without me
Hope you haven't left without me, please
Don't forget about me
Don't forget about me
Even when I doubt you
I'm no good without you
No
Don't forget about me
Don't forget about me
Even when I doubt you
I'm no good without you
No, no, no, no
