It's dangerous to fall in love
But I want to burn with you tonight
Hurt me
There's two of us
We're bristling with desire
The pleasure's pain and fire
Burn me
So come on
I'll take you on, take you on
I ache for love, ache for us
Why don't you come
Don't you come a little closer
So come on now
Strike the match, strike the match now
We're a perfect match, perfect somehow
We were meant for one another
Come a little closer

Flame you came to me
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
I'm burning alive
I can barely breathe
When you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
I got all I need
When you came after me
Fire meet gasoline
I'm burning alive
And I can barely breathe
When you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline

Burn with me tonight

And we will fly
Like smoke darknin' the skies

I'm Eve, I wanna try
Take a bite

So come on now
Strike the match, strike the match now

We're a perfect match, perfect somehow
We were meant for one another
Come a little closer

Flame you came to me
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
I'm burning alive
I can barely breathe
When you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline

I got all I need
When you came after me
Fire meet gasoline
I'm burning alive

And I can barely breathe
When you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline
Burn with me tonight
But it's a bad debt
Certain death
But I want what I want
And I gotta get it
When the fire dies
Darkened skies
Hot ash, dead match

Only smoke is left
But it's a bad debt
Certain death
But I want what I want
And I got to get it

When the fire dies
Dark in the skies
Hot as match
Only smoke is left
Flame it came to me
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
I'm burning alive
I can barely breathe
When you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
I got all I need
When you came after me
Fire meet gasoline
I'm burning alive
And I can barely breathe
When you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline
Burn with me tonight
Burn with me tonight
Burn with me tonight
Burn with me tonight
Eh, eh
