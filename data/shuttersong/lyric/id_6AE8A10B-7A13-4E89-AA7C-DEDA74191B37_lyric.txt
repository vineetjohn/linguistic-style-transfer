Baby, I don't know
Just why I love you so
Maybe it's just the way
That God made me this day

Baby, I don't know
Just why I love you so
Maybe it's just the way
That God made me this day

Honey, I need you
And I feel for you
It won't be too long till
We're back as one again

Baby, I don't know
Just why I love you so
Maybe it's just the way
That God made me this day
