I wanna be a billionaire so fuckin' bad
Buy all of the things I never had

I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen
Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights
Yeah, a different city every night
Oh, I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie your wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit

Give away a few Mercedes, like here lady have this
And last but not least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months since I've single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the Ho Hos
Get it I'd probably visit where Katrina hit

And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid

Everywhere I go I'ma have my own theme music
Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights
A different city every night
Oh, I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh oh, oh oh, for when I'm a Billionaire
Oh oh, oh oh
I'll be playing basketball with the President
Dunking on his delegates
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple million in the air just for the heck of it

But keep the fives, twenties, hiz and biz completely separate
And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession, but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up

So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet, put it in the air and sing
I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen
Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights
A different city every night
Oh, I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire
When I'm a billionaire
I wanna be a billionaire so fuckin' bad...
