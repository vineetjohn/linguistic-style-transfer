Good weed, white wine, uh

Okay, away we go
Only thing we have on is the radio-oh
Let it play, say you gotta leave
But I know you wanna stay
You are waiting on the traffic jam to finish girl
The things we could do in twenty minutes girl
Say my name, say my name
Wear it out, its getting hot, crack a window, air it out
I can get you through a mighty long day
Soon as I go the text you goin' right is goin' say

Knows how to work my body
Knows how to make me want it
But boy you stay up on it
You got that something
That keeps me so off balance

Every door you enter, I will let you in
