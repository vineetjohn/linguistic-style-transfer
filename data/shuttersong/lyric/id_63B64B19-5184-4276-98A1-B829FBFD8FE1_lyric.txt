Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Why do you look so familiar?
I could swear that I
Have seen your face before
I think I like that you seem sincere
I think I'd like to get
To know you a little bit more

I think there's something more
Life's worth living for

Who knows what could happen?
Do what you do
Just keep on laughing
One thing's true
There's always a brand new day
I'm gonna live today like it's my last day

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

How do you always have an opinion?
And how do you always find
The best way to compromise?
We don't need to have a reason
We don't need anything
We're just wasting time

I think there's something more
Life's worth living for

Who knows what could happen?
Do what you do
Just keep on laughing
One thing's true
There's always a brand new day

Who knows what could happen?
Do what you do
Just keep on laughing
One thing's true
There's always a brand new day
I'm gonna live today like it's my last day

Find yourself
'Cause I can't find you
Be yourself
Who are you?
Find yourself
'Cause I can't find you
Be yourself
Who are you?

Who knows what could happen?
Do what you do
Just keep on laughing
One thing's true
There's always a brand new day

So you go make it happen
Do your best
Just keep on laughing
I'm telling you
There's always a brand new day
Who knows what could happen?
Do what you do
Just keep on laughing
One thing's true
There's always a brand new day
I'm gonna live today like it's my last day
