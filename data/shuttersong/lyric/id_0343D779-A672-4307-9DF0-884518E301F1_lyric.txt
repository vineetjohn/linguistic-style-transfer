Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay, would it be a sin?
If I can't help falling in love with you

Like the river flows
Shortly to the sea
Darling so we go
Some things were meant to be

Take my hand, take my whole life too
If I can't help falling in love with you

Like the river flows
Shortly to the sea
Darling so we go
Some things were meant to be
Oh

Take my hand, take my whole life too
'Cause I can't help falling in love with you
'Cause I can't help falling in love with you

But I can't help falling in love with you
