The winner is
Beyonce Knowles female pop vocalist!
I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love
I love you Houston
And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wander
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cuz all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring
All these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels I'm touring
All these people on the planet
Working 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
All the people on the planet
Working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
How come?
What goes up, ghost around
Goes around around around around
What goes up, ghost around
Ghost around around around around
Ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und
Ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und
Ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und
Sold not for sale
Probably won't make no money off this, oh well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so... Mm
It's what you do
It's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
It's where we go
It's where we'll be
I know if I'm on to you, I'm on to you
On to you, you must be on to me
My haunted lungs
Ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
My wicked tongue
Where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you
I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, you must be on to me
You want me?
I walk down the hallway
You're lucky
The bedroom's my runway
Slap me!
I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay
My haunted lungs
Ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
My wicked tongue
Where will it be
I know if I'm onto you
You must be onto me
It's what we see
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
It's where we go
It's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
You must be onto me (on to you, I'm on to you)
You must be onto me (on to you, I'm on to you)
You must be onto me (on to you, I'm on to you)
Me (on to you, I'm on to you)
Me (on to you, I'm on to you)
Me (on to you, I'm on to you)
Me (on to you, I'm on to you)
Me (on to you, I'm on to you)
