[Verse 1 - Beyoncé:]
These four lonely walls have changed the way I feel
The way I feel, I'm standing still
And nothing else matters now, you're not here
So where are you? I've been calling you, I'm missing you

[Pre-Chorus - Beyoncé:]
Where else can I go? Where else can I go?
Chasing you, chasing you
Memories turn to dust, please don't bury us
I got you, I got you

[Chorus - Beyoncé:]
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
Together we'll win it all
I ain't runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
I'm ready to face it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all

[Verse 2 - Arrow Benjamin:]
I've outrun the fears that chased, they're standing still
I'm running still, I'm running still
And every voice that cries inside my head, forever drives
Forever drives, I kill the lights

[Pre-Chorus - Arrow Benjamin:]
Where else can I go? Where else can I go?
Chasing you, chasing you

[Chorus - Arrow Benjamin & Beyoncé:]
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
Together we'll win it all
I ain't runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
I'm ready to face it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all
