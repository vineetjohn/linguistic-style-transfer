There's a dream in my soul,
A fire that's deep inside me.
There's a me no one knows,
Waiting to be set free.

I'm gonna see that day;
I can feel it,
I can taste it.
Change is coming my way.

I was born to be somebody.
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me.
I'll light up the sky like lightning,
I'm gonna rise above,
Show 'em what I'm made of.
I was born to be somebody,
I was born to be,
And this world will belong to me.

This life can kick you around (whoa)
This world can make you feel small (whoa)
They will not keep me down (whoa)
I was born to stand tall.

I'm goin' all the way.
I can feel it, I believe it.
I'm here, I'm here to stay.

I was born to be somebody.
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me.

I'll light up the sky like lighting,
I'm gonna rise above,
Show 'em what I'm made of.
I was born to be somebody,
I was born to be,
And this world will belong to me.

Feel it,
Believe it,
Dream it,
Be it.

I was born to be somebody.
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me (no, no, no)
I'll light up the sky like lighting,
I'm gonna rise above,
Show 'em what I'm made of.
I was born to be somebody,
I was born to be,
And this world will belong to me.

Oh, oh,
Oh, oh...

And this world will belong to me.

Yeah, yeah, oh...

This world will belong to me.
