Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?

This ain't no fucking sing-along
So girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4

20, keep the bar rollin
Fake IDs and the trash we going
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a handful of girls and they all so foreign

Rain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lot of friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lot of girls, first flight from Poland
Why? 'Cause

They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew

They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
ohhhh

Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall

And really I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50K on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces, all it took was patience

I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, then made history

Tell them imma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
I'd much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and XO is everything you believe in, I know
They loving the crew

They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
If you broadcast swag, nigga we the news in the city
