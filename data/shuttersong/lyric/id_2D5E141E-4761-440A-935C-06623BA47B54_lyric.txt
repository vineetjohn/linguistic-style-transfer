When your best friend's all strung out
You'll do everything you can
'Cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
(When you find it all around)
Yeah, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start

Feelings, sleeping, in the field again,
But I can feel, I can feel
I can feel, it's beginning to end

Yeah, premonitions smiling in the dark
I can see, I can see
I can see the story's starting to arc

Ohhh ohhhh ohhhh ohhhhh

It dries up
I've been a spoken word
I've been a river bed
I've been a rabid force
And let it flow out from within

Sometimes it feels like I only dream in black and white

Ahhh, ahhhh, ahhhhhh, ahhhhh
And color's so, oh!

(When your best friend's all strung out)
You'll do everything you can
'Cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
(When you find it all around)
Yeah, you say it's what you need
And hide your eyes when you're close to me
(When your feet up in the clouds)
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start

Waves in theta, slipping into dreams
I can feel, I can feel
I can feel the celestial beings

Wilted pleasures leave you with a breath
I can see, I can see
I can see the beauty in the mess

Ohhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhh

It dries up
I've been a river bed
I tried to salt the wound
I've carried more than I can
I feel I've got a lot to prove
Sometimes it feels like I only dream in black and white

Ohhh, ohhh, ohhhh, ohhh
And color's so, oh!

(When your best friend's all strung out)
You'll do everything you can
'Cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
(When you find it all around)
Yeah, you say it's what you need
And hide your eyes when you're close to me
(With you feet up in the clouds)
You oughta know
That I'm here no matter where you go
(With your head hanging upside-down)
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start

I am here, no matter where you are
I'm waiting here with open arms, no matter where you are
Sometimes, you have to wait,
Until it passes by like a satellite or star
No matter where you are

(When your best friend's all strung out)
You know it
Ooh-hoooo-hooooo
(When your feet up in the clouds)
Oh, yeah, you know it
Ooh-hoooo-ooh hooooo

(When your best friend's all strung out)
Oh, yeah, you know it
You oughta know
That I'm here no matter where you go
(With your head, hanging upside-down)
Yeah, you know it
That's how you know
That your best friend's all strung out
