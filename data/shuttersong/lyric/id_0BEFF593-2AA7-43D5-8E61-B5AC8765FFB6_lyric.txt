Some day my prince will come,
Some day I'll find my love

some day some day
I say some day my prince will come
Some day some day

Some day my prince will come,
Some day I'll find my love,
and how thrilling that moment will be,
When the prince of my dreams comes to me.

He'll whisper "I love you"
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true, come true.

Some day I'll find my love,
Someone to call my own,
and I'll know him the moment we meet,
For my heart will be skipping a beat.

Some day we'll say and do
All the things we've been longing to
Though he's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true.

He's somewhere waiting for me
There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who thrills me forever more

Some day some day
I said I'm gonna find my love some day
Some day some day
I said I'm gonna find my love my love some day
Some day some day
I said some day I'm gonna find my love
Some day some day
I said he's out there waiting for me
Some day some day
I said some day
Some day some day
Oh no no no no no no..
Some day some day
I said some day my prince is
Some day some day
He'll whisper "I love you"
Some day some day
I said he's somewhere waiting for me
Some day some day
I said he's gonna come baby to me
Some day some day ...
