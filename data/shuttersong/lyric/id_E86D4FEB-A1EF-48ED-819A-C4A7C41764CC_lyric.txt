Instead of dreaming
I Sleepwalk
Cause I lost you
And now what am I to do
What to do.
Can£§t believe that we£§re through
I don£§t care how much you tell me
Sleeptalk
Cause I miss you
While the memory of you
Lingers like a song
Darling, I was so wrong
But I£§ll be right some day
The night fills my lonely place
I see your face
I know, I miss you so
I still love you
And it drives me insane
Sleepwalk
Every night I just Sleepwalk
And when you walk inside the door
I will Sleepwalk no more
Sleepwalk
Every night I just Sleepwalk
And when you walk inside the door
I will Sleepwalk no more
I will Sleepwalk no more
I will Sleepwalk no more
