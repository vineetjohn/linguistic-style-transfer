Much as you blame yourself
You can't be blamed for the way that you feel
Had no example of a love
That was even remotely real
How can you understand
Something that you never had?
Ooh, baby, if you let me
I can help you out with all of that
Girl, let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl, let me love you
I know your trouble
Don't be afraid
Girl, let me help
Girl, let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl, let me love you
A heart in numbness
Is brought to life
I'll take you there
Hey, hey
(Girl, let me love you)
Girl, let me love you, baby, oh
(Girl, let me love you)
Girl, let me love you, baby
(Girl, let me love you)
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh
Ooh
I can see the pain behind your eyes
It's been there for quite a while
I just wanna be the one
To remind you what it is to smile, yeah
I would like to show you
What true love can really do
Girl, let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl, let me love you
I know your trouble
Don't be afraid
Girl, let me help
Girl, let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl, let me love you
A heart in numbness
Is brought to life
I'll take you there
Oh, oh, oh, hey
Girl, let me love you, baby
(Girl, let me love you)
Girl, let me love you, baby
(Girl, let me love you)
Girl, let me love you, baby
(Girl, let me love you)
Girl, let me love you, baby
For every heart that beats
For every heart that beats
For every heart that beats
For every heart that beats
Heart that beats
Heart that beats
Heart that beats
Heart that beats
Girl, let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl, let me love you
I know your trouble
Don't be afraid
Girl, let me help
Girl, let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl, let me love you
A heart in darkness
Is brought to life
I'll take you there
(Girl, let me love you)
Darlin', let me love you, baby
Love you, baby, hey
(Girl, let me love you)
Let me love you, baby
You, babe
Ooh, ooh, oh
