I'm just listening to the clock go ticking
I am waiting as the time goes by
I think of you with every breath I take
I need to feel your heartbeat next to mine
You're all I see in everything

I just wanna hold you
I just wanna kiss you
I just wanna love you all my life
normally wouldn't say this but I just can't contain it
want you here forever right here by my side

All the fears you feel inside
And all the tears you've cried
They're ending right here
I'll heal your hardened soul
I'll keep you oh so close
Don't worry; I'll never let you go
You're all I need
You're everything

I just wanna hold you
I just wanna kiss you
I just wanna love you all my life
normally wouldn't say this but I just can't contain it
want you here forever right here by my side

No one else would ever do
I've got a stubborn heart for you
Call me crazy but it's true
I love you
I didn't think that it would be you who made it clear to me
You're all I need

I just wanna hold you
I just wanna kiss you
I just wanna love you all my life
normally wouldn't say this but I just can't contain it
want you here forever right here by my side
