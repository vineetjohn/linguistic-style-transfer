I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

You and me together through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You, you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
When the rain is pouring down

And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain
You and me together through the days and nights

I don't worry 'cause everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one

Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You, you
Can get in the way of what I feel.
I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try
Try to divide
Something so real
So 'til the end of time I'm telling you there is no one
No one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
