I'm not a rapper I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know
You'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten
Cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signed to a label
But didn't listen to any criticism

Thought you knew but you didn't
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is the system
And you could say that I'm driven
And now it's onto the next saga
We drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I do my own thing now
And get respect after
And I'm avoiding the 'caine
Like it was Get Carter

For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded
Like a paper weight
At 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
Went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star
And adding to the population
Not my imagination
I don't wanna relax

Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?

I take it back now

Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love

No

I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack I'll be singing the news
Tryin' act like Jack Black
When I bring it to school
I make a beat with my feet
By just hittin' the loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove
That I can fit in these shoes
I give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene
Like an opal fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens
Is from now on

I'll be ready to start again

By the end of the song
Since they are claiming I handled it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy
Except the NME but I'll be selling
Twice as many copies as their magazine will ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me
And festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on pedigree
Singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I'm battling for respect and I don't know if I have it

This song's from the heart cover the planet
I take it back now

Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us

Don't you fade into the back love
No
And take it back now

Now I don't ever wanna be perfect
Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed
Taken my first steps into the scene giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
'Cause every days some lyrics and a melody can be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking absinth can change your mind state
Vividly need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends
Is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
'Cause that how it's supposed to be
I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams
But, but I just write schemes

I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans

Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint of Mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down, that's how we plan it out
It's time to take it back now

Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

Mmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No
