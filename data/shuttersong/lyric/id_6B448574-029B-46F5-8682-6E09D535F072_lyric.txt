One, two, three
Two, two, three

Love is blindness
I don't wanna see
Won't you wrap the night
Around me
Oh, my heart
Love is blindness.

I'm in a parked car
On a crowded street
And I see my love
Made complete.
The thread is ripping
The knot is slipping.
Love is blindness.

Love is clockworks
And it's cold steel
Fingers too numb to feel
Squeeze the handle
Blow out the candle
Blindness

I don't wanna see
Won't you wrap the night
Around me
Oh my love
Blindness

A little death
Without mourning
No call
No Warning
Baby, a dangerous idea...
Almost makes... sense

Love is drowning
In a deep web
All the secrets
And no body else to tell
Take the money
Why don't you honey
Blindness

Love is blindness
I'm so sick of it
I don't wanna see
Why don't you just take the night
And wrap it all around me, now
Oh my love
Blindness
Oh, I'm too numb to feel...
Blow out the candle.
Blindness.
