I'll follow you out of the dark.
I tried it my way but I keep falling apart!

All that I see, is the wickedness around me.
I refuse to believe, the apocalypse inside of me.
I can't even trust myself.
I'm burning in my skin.
Standing at the gates of hell, but nobody will let me in.

I'll follow you out of the dark.
I tried it my way but I keep falling apart!
I'll follow you, with all of my heart.
I'm tired of my ways cause I keep falling and falling apart!

I stand here again, forsaken in a place
that feels like I can never win.
I'm reaching for a saving grace.
I can't even trust no one.
I need to rise above.
I don't think I'm good enough, to feel your perfect love.

I'll follow you out of the dark!
I tried it my way but I keep falling apart!
I'll follow you, with all of my heart!
I'm tired of my ways cause I keep falling and falling apart!
I'm falling and falling apart.
I'm falling and falling apart.
I'm falling apart.

Your love's a fire, it's alive and I'm burning in it.
I'm in the ashes of mercy; I'm covered in it.
I fall hard and you carry me.
I fall apart so you can set me free.
Your love's a fire, it's alive and I'm burning in it.
I'm in the ashes of mercy; I'm covered in it.
I fall hard and you carry me.
I fall apart so you can set me free.
I'll follow you out of the dark!
I tried it my way but I keep falling apart!
I'll follow you with all of my heart!
I'm tired of my ways, cause I keep falling and falling apart!
I'm falling and falling apart!
Without you I'm falling apart!
I'm falling and falling apart.
