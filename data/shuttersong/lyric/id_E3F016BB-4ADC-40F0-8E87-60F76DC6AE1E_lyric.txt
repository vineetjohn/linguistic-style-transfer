It's all about you
(It's about you)
It's all about you, baby
(It's all about)

It's all about you
(It's about you)
It's all about you
Yesterday, you asked me something I thought you knew

So I told you with a smile 'It's all about you'
Then you whispered in my ear and you told me too
Said, 'You make my life worthwhile, it's all about you'
And I would answer all your wishes, if you asked me to
But if you deny me one of your kisses, don't know what I'd do
So hold me close and say three words, like you used to do

Dancing on the kitchen tiles, it's all about you.

Yeah...
And I would answer all your wishes, if you asked me to

Dancing on the kitchen tiles
Yes you make my life worthwhile
So I told you with a smile...
It's all about you
It's all about you

It's all about you, baby

It's all about you

It's all about you

It's all about you
It's all about
You
