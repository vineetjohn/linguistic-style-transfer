 dirty secrets that I keep
Does he know it's killing me?
He knows, he knows
D-d-does he know another's hands have touched my skin?
 I won't tell him where  I've been
He knows, he knows
He knows
It's tearing me apart
And she's slipping away ( I'm slipping away)
Am  I just hanging on to all the words she used to say?
The pictures on her phone
And she's not coming home ( I'm not coming home)
Coming home, coming home
 I know what you did last summer
Just lie to me, there is no other
 I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you've been
 I know what you did last summer
Look me in the eyes, my lover
 I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you've been
 I know,  I know,  I know,  I know
 I know,  I know,  I know
 I know,  I know,  I know,  I know
 I know,  I know,  I know
 I didn't mean it, no
 I didn't mean it, mean it, no
Can't seem to let you go
Can't seem to hold you close
 I know when she looks me in the eyes
They don't seem as bright
No more, no more,  I know
But she loved me at one time
Would  I promise her  that night
Cross my heart and hope to die
It's tearing me apart (It's tearing me apart
And she's slipping away ( I'm slipping away)
Am  I just hanging on to all the words she used to say?
The pictures on her phone (The pictures on her phone)
And she's not coming home ( I'm not coming home)
Oh, na na na, ah yeah
