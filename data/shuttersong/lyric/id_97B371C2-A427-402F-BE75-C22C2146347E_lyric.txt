I think you wanna come over
Yeah I heard it through the grapevine
Are you drunk? Are you sober?
(Think about it)
Doesn't matter
And if it makes you feel good then I say do it
I don't know what you're waiting for

Feel my temperature rising
It's too much heat
I'm gonna lose control
Do you want to go higher?
Get closer to the fire
I don't what you're waiting for

Come join the party
(Yeah)
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started
(Yeah)
'Cause everybody wants to party with you

Boy you got a reputation
But you're gonna have to prove it
I see a little hesitation
Am I gonna have to show ya
That if it feels right
Get on your mark
Step to the beat boy
That's what its for

Put your arms around me
When it gets too hot we can go outside
But for now just come here
Let me whisper in your ear
An invitation to the dance of life

Come join the party
(It's a celebration)
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started
(No more hesitation)
'Cause everybody wants to party with you

Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
You look familiar
You wanna dance?
Yeah
I guess I just don't recognize you with your clothes on
What are you waiting for?

Come join the party
(It's a celebration)
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started
