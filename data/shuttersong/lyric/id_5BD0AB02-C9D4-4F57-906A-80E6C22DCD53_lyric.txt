The Cranberries - Roses
Life is no garden of roses
More like a thistle in time
Sailing past
Waiting for no one this time
Sailing fast
Waiting for no one this time
Now that you¡¯ve killed me with your eyes'
Why did you push me away 
How will i make it without you 
How will i go on my way 
Everything feels cold in the winter
Everything feels cold  
Everything feels cold in the winter
Everything feels cold  
Life is a garden of roses
Roses just wither and die
Now that you¡¯ve killed me with your eyes'
Why did you push me away 
How will i make it without you
How will i go on my way
Life is a garden of roses
Roses just wither and die
