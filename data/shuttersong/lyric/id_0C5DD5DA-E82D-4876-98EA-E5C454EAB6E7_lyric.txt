Hey, Macklemore, can we go thrift shopping?

What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

Walk into the club like "What up? I got a big cock!"
Nah, I'm just pumped, bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like "Damn, that's a cold ass honky!"
Rollin' in hella deep, headed to the Mezzanine
Dressed in all pink except my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standin' next to me
Probably shoulda washed this, smells like R. Kelly's sheets (Pisssssss)
But shit, it was ninety-nine cents!
Bag it, coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins someone else been has walkin' in
Bummy and grudgy, fuckin' it, I am stunting and flossin' and
Savin' my money and I'm hella happy, that's a bargain bitch
I'ma take your grandpa's style
I'ma take your grandpa's style
No for real, ask your grandpa
Can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you!)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found, dig it
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my Mello
John Wayne ain't got nothin' on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make 'em cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like "Ah, he got the Velcros!"

What you know about rockin' a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowin' about wearin' a fur fox skin?
I'm diggin', I'm diggin', I'm searchin' right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come up
Thank your granddad for donatin' that plaid button
Up shirt, ¡®cause right now, I'm up in here stuntin'
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the (Uptons)
I'm that, I'm that sucker searchin' in this section (Uptons)
Your grammy, your aunty, your momma, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies, secondhand and rock that motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on that motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like "Oh that Gucci, that's hella tight!"
I'm like "Yo, that's fifty dollars for a t-shirt!"
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a t-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch (shit)
I call that getting swindled and pimped, shit
I call that getting tricked by a business, that shirt's hella dough
And havin' the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Tryin' to get girls from a brand, man, you hella won't
Man, you hella won't

(Goodwill... poppin' tags... yeah!)

I'll wear your granddad's clothes
I look incredible
I'm in this big ass coat
From that thrift shop down the road
