O... Let me tell you girl
Woa, oh, oh, o... hey, here I go, here I go

I know you heard EM say it
time and time again
that they would ROCK your world
And change your life
But I can't blame them
Cause you make a nigga wanna get involved
Wanna get dem draws
Well I'm gone put my bit in
to get at u
No disrespect but I want it bad as they do
The only difference is
they look out for themselves
But I'm doin' it, just to hear you yell, yeah

[Chorus]
O... that's gunna be the sound
Girl when its goin' down
Your body sayin O... (O, o, oh)

So you can say O...(in the morning)

You can't be mad at me
I'm just aiming to please
Let me hear you scream O...

[Verse 2]
Girl come on over
And let's get this thing crackin
You'll be surprised
when you see what's O's unpackin
Cause I'm young but I'm ready
Trynna get hot and heavy
Turn you out if you let me in
Yeah, yeah
Girl I'm gone take you somewhere

Show you some things that'll

Have you so weak that you can't even say a thing
But that's okay all you gotta say is

But trust me baby girl

Girl believe me when I tell you
I'm not tryna tell you what to do
Cause when its said and done
The choice ain't mine it's really up to you
Just say yes, don't fix your mouth to tell me no
Drop that bottom JAW for me and just say Ooooooooooooo... O, O, Oh, O, O
