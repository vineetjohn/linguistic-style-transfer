She wants me to come over
I can tell her eyes don't lie
She's calling me in the dark
She moves us where the room around the lights turn like the sky
Confidence like a rock star

I wanna put my hands on her hands
Feel the heat from her skin
Get reckless in the starlight
I'm moving to the beat of her heart
I was so lost until tonight, tonight

I found you, in the darkest hour
I found you, in the pouring rain
I found you, when I was on my knees
And your light brought me back again
Found you in the river of pure emotions
I found you, my only truth
I found you, when the music played

I was lost, till I found you, you, you
Till I found you, you, you

The night is getting older
And I can't come off this high
I don't want this here to end
I know she feels the same
'Cause I can see it in her eyes
She says, "Can we start again?"

I wanna put my hands on her hands
Feel the heat from her skin
Get reckless in the starlight
She's moving to the beat of my heart
We're so lost until tonight, tonight
¡°
I found you, when the music played
¡ª The Wanted
I found you, in the darkest hour
I found you, in the pouring rain
I found you, when I was on my knees
And your light brought me back again
Found you in the river of pure emotions
I found you, my only truth
I found you, when the music played

I was lost, till I found you, you, you
Till I found you, you, you
I said, people
We're all looking for love tonight
But sometimes we can't see it
We run blinded by the light
And we all get lost, all get lost
Searching for that peace of mind
Just when I have given up
Looking for some kind of sign
That's when I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you
I found you, in my darkest hour
I found you, in the pouring rain
I found you, when I was on my knees
And your light brought me back again
Found you in the river of pure emotions
I found you, my only truth
I found you, when the music played
I was lost till I found you
