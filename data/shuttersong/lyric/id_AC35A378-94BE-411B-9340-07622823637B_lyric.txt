Pressure - The 1975
 
You've seen so many faces that I've never seen before 
I left an un-rewarding message telling you to come on
Over dramatic  automatically assume I'll stay the same 
 
There's a change in pressure
We're never gonna lie to you 
(Change in pressure)
My broken veins say that if my heart stops beating
(Change in pressure)
"We'll bleed the same way"
(Change in pressure)
Oh  my broken veins say 
 
Well I stay tuned  listen to the news
And try to fall asleep at night 
Because I'm living in a house with just three walls 
So I'm always getting recognized 
 
There's a change in pressure
We're never gonna lie to you 
(Change in pressure)
My broken veins say that if my heart stops beating
(Change in pressure)
"We'll bleed the same way"
(Change in pressure)
Oh  my broken veins say 
 
(Change in pressure)
(Change in pressure)
(Change in pressure)
(Change in pressure)
 
There's a change in pressure
We're never gonna lie to you 
(Change in pressure)
My broken veins say that if my heart stops beating
(Change in pressure)
"We'll bleed the same way"
(Change in pressure)
