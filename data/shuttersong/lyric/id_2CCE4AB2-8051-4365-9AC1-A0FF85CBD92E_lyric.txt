My life is brilliant

My life is brilliant
My love is pure
I saw an angel
Of that l'm sure

She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

Yes, she caught my eye
As we walked on by
She could see from my face that I was fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again but
We shared a moment that will last 'till the end

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
There must be an angel with a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you

But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you
