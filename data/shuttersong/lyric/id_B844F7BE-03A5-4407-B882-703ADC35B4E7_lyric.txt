You're giving me fever
You're making the pressure rise at night right through my veins
You're making my heart sing
You're making my voice reach places that it's never been
No, no, no, no...
You're making me weak
I lie awake all night daydreaming
When will you be mine?
You're making my sleep wait
Thinking of you is taking all my nights away-way-way

I really do adore you
You're lovely
I really do adore you, you, you, you
You're lovely
I really do adore...

[Abhi Dijon:]
And I adore you too
I've been thinking that your love is kinda special (yeah)
You should know that I adore you too

Can't sleep at night
You're my addiction
So compulsive
It's not right
I'm drowning in your smile
You're so contagious
Spreading through me
Got my fever up all night
And I can feel you through the night
And moving through me, I can't fight it
You're my obsession
Intoxicated
And you know that you do this to me
Cast your spell so you can rule me
Surrender to you

I really do adore you
My lovely
I really do adore you, you, you, you
My lovely
I really do adore...
[repeat]

[Abhi Dijon:]
And I adore you too
I've been thinking that your love is kinda special (yeah)
You should know that I adore you too

Adore (you)
