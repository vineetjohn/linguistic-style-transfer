Stay with me, baby stay with me
Tonight don't leave me alone.
Walk with me, come and walk with me
To the edge of all we've ever known.

I can see you there with the city lights
Fourteenth floor, pale blue eyes.
I can breathe you in.

Two shadows standing by the bedroom door
No, I could not want you more than I did right then
As our heads leaned in.

Well, I'm not sure what this is gonna be
But with my eyes closed all I see
Is the skyline, through the window
The moon above you and the streets below.
Hold my breath as you're moving in
Taste your lips and feel your skin.

When the time comes, baby don't run, just kiss me slowly.
Stay with me, baby stay with me
Tonight don't leave me alone.
She shows me everything she used to know

Picture frames and country roads
When the days were long and the world was small.
She stood by as it fell apart
Separate rooms and broken hearts

But I won't be the one to let you go.
Oh, I'm not sure what this is gonna be
But with my eyes closed all I see
Is the skyline, through the window
The moon above you and the streets below.
Hold my breath as you're moving in

Taste your lips and feel your skin.

When the time comes, baby don't run, just kiss me slowly.
Don't run away...
And it's hard to love again
When the only way it's been

When the only love you know
Just walked away...
If it's something that you want
Darling you don't have to run

You don't have to go ...
Just stay with me, baby stay with me
Well, I'm not sure what this is gonna be
But with my eyes closed all I see
Is the skyline, through the window
The moon above you and the streets below.
Hold my breath as you're moving in
Taste your lips and feel your skin.
When the time comes, baby don't run, just kiss me slowly.
Oh, I'm not sure what this is gonna go
But in this moment all I know
Is the skyline, through the window
The moon above you and the streets below.
Hold my breath as you're moving in
Taste your lips and feel your skin.
When the time comes, baby don't run, just kiss me slowly.
