I know

I know

I know

I know

I will be there for you

All this love that I am giving

Can it ever be enough

Let's go back to the beginning

Will it be the end of us

Pre-Give me a sign,

Tell me what you need

Tell me what you need

Throw my hands up high and surrender

You can count on me,

You can count on me,

I know

I know

I know

I know

I will be there for you

Cheating hearts, lying eyes, broken promises

I heard them all, but they never hurt like this

I'm in the dark when we're apart

And I miss the way you look right through me

No one else can move me

Pre-Give me a sign,

Tell me what you need

Tell me what you need

Throw my hands up high and surrender

You can count on me,

You can count on me,

I know

I know

I know

I know

I will be there for you

Oh baby

I, I,

I, I,

Oh baby

I know

I know

I know

I know

I will be there for you

Pre-Give me a sign,

Tell me what you need

Tell me what you need

Throw my hands up high and surrender

You can count on me,

You can count on me,

I know

I know

I know

I know

I never knew what I could feel

I will be there for you

I know

We got eachother baby

I know

We got eachother baby

I know

We got eachother baby

I know

I will be there for you
