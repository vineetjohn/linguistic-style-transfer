To know what it's like to love somebody the way I love you
To know what it's take to love somebody the way I love you
To know how it feels to kill yourself with bad habits
To know what you want and know you'll never truly have it
New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
'Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me tonight

New York City, please go easy on me tonight

When I went away, saw your face in my rear-view
I knew that look on your face, that I had lost you
New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
'Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me tonight

You promised, I promised
I never knew I could be this selfish
Nights downtown, it's a new town
But I keep thinking I see your face in the crowd
But you're not here, and you won't be
'Cause you love me enough to let go of me

New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
'Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me tonight
