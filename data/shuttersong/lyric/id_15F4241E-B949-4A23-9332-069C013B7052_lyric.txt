I don't know if you were looking at me or not
You probably smile like that all the time
And I don't mean to bother you but
I couldn't just walk by
And not say hi

And I know your name
Cuz everybody in here knows your name
And you're not looking for anything right now
So I don't wanna come on strong
But don't get me wrong
Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
It's just a conversation
No girl I'm not gunna waste it
You don't know me
I don't know you but I want to

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just want to take your time

I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I ain't gunna waste my lies
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

And I know it starts with hello
And the next thing you know your trying to be nice
And some guys getting too close
Tryin to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk

And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
Cuz she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk to much and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well

You coulda rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Coulda walked away
But your still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time

I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time

I don't wanna go home with you

I just wanna be alone with you

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
No, I ain't gotta call you baby
And I ain't gotta call you mine
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
