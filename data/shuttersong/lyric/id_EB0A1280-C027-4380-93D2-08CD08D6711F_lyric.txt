Open up the champagne, pop!
It's my house, come on, turn it up

Hear a knock on the door and the night begins
Cause we done this before so you come on in
Make yourself at my home, tell me where you been
Pour yourself something cold, baby, cheers to this

Sometimes you gotta stay in
And you know where I live
Yeah, you know what we is
Sometimes you gotta stay in, in

Welcome to my house
Baby take control now
We can't even slow down
We don't like to go out
Welcome to my house
Play that music too loud
Show me what you do now
We don't like to go out
Welcome to my house

Welcome to my house
Morning comes and you know that you wanna stay
Close the blinds, let's pretend that the time has changed

Keep our clothes on the floor, open up champagne
Let's continue tonight, come on, celebrate
Sometimes you gotta stay in

And you know where I live
Yeah, you know what we is
Sometimes you gotta stay in, in
Welcome to my house
Baby take control now
We can't even slow down
We don't like to go out
Welcome to my house
Play that music too loud
Show me what you do now

We don't like to go out
Welcome to my house
Welcome to my house
Welcome to my the crib, the spot, the pad
But my house is your house if you throwin' it back
Excuse me if my home

Soon as these happy faces you can run with the cash
Homerun, slam dunk, touchdown, pass
Mi casa es tu casa so it ain't no holding back
Another shot of vodka, you know what's in my glass
It's my house, just relax
Welcome to my house
Baby take control now
We can't even slow down
We don't like to go out
Welcome to my house
Play that music too loud
Show me what you do now
We don't like to go out
Welcome to my house
Welcome to my house
Welcome to my house
It's my house
