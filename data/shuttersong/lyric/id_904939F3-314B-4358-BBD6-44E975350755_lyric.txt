I was a hot mess
In my Sunday best
Black tears in my eyes.

You were my first love
You were my only one
I can't believe your lies.

Once we were like bottle rockets
Now I know I have to stop it
Please believe me
This isn't easy
I just need to say goodbye.

Goodbye
Goodbye
Losin' my mind
Goodbye!

You got a new friend
You like to play pretend
I'm just keepin' my cool.

Turn on that smoke machine
Magic and make-believe
She'll never know you like I do.

Once we were a fire burnin'
Now you're just a lesson I'm learnin'
Please believe me
This isn't easy
I just need to say goodbye.

Goodbye
Goodbye
Losin' my mind
Goodbye!

I know that I can find somebody
You won't ever find nobody else like me!
I know that I can find somebody
You won't ever find nobody else like me!
I know that I can find somebody
You won't ever find nobody else like me!
I know that I can find somebody
You won't ever find nobody else like me!

Once we were like bottle rockets
Now I know I have to stop it
Please believe me
This isn't easy
I just need to say goodbye.
Goodbye
Goodbye
Losin' my mind
Goodbye!
