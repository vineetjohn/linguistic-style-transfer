Don't look at me
It's way too soon to see
What's gonna be
Don't look at me

All my life
I never knew what I could be
What I could do
Then we were new
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

You came along
And made my life a song
One lucky day, you came along

Just in time
When I was searching for a rhyme
You came along
Then we were new
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

We can do what we want
We can live as we choose
You see, there is no guarantee
We've got nothing to lose

Don't look at me
I can't deny the truth
It's plain to see
Don't look at me

All my life
I never knew what I could be
What I could do
Then we were new
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

We can do what we want
We can live as we choose
You see, there is no guarantee
We've got nothing to lose

Don't look at me
It's way too soon to see
What's gonna be
Don't look at me

All my life
I never knew what I could be
What I could do
Then we were new
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Then we were new
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Now we are new
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
