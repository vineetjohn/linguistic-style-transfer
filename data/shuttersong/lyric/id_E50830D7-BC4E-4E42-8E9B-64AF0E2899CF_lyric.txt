I got a big dream, small world in between
Me and everything I can't do
Not really bad day, just okay
I kinda think you sucked the life right out of the blue
I know most likely
How I used to be a frail and silly thought in your mind
Don't be unkind
You're so far behind me
But I can see something more
Than the things you try to take
Now, you've made a mistake
Don't you cry
It's mine
It's mine
I saw the parade, big band, must convince
So I'm thinkin' out on my feet
Back at the first page, shut the game, for you, it ain't
Oh, nothing else could be more complete
I know most likely
How I used to be a frail and silly thought in your mind
Call me your kind
You're so far behind me
But I can see something more
Than the things you try to take
Now, you've made a mistake
Don't you cry
It's mine
It's mine
In my mind
In your head, in your heart, in your hiding emotion
Where the (waters meet?)
Im my mind
In the head, in the heart, in your hiding emotion
Where the (waters meet?)
But I can see something more
Than the things you try to take
Now, you've made a mistake
Don't you cry
It's mine
It's mine
It's mine
It's mine
If I stare into the darkness, I won't know where I am
I haven't seen the daylight since I started giving in
My eyes are falling heavy, my feet are moving slow
Am I main fature not in the stone
