Honestly, what will become of me?
I don't like reality
It's way too clear to me
But really life is dandy
We are what we don't see
We miss everything daydreaming

Flames to dust
Lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end?

Flames to dust
Lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end?

Traveling I always stop at exits
Wondering if I'll stay
Young and restless

Living this way I stress less
I want to pull away when the dream dies
The pain sets it and I don't cry

I only feel gravity and I wonder why
Flames to dust
Lovers to friends

Why do all good things come to an end?
Flames to dust
Lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end?

Come to an end, come to an
Why do all good things come to an end?
Come to an end, come to an
Why do all good things come to an end?

Dogs were whistling a new tune
Barking at the new moon
Hoping it would come soon

So that they could
Dogs were whistling a new tune
Barking at the new moon

Hoping it would come soon
So that they could die
Die, die, die

Well the dogs were barking at the new moon
Whistling a new tune
Hoping it will come soon
And the sun was wondering if it should
Stay away for a day ‘til the feeling went away
And the sky was falling
And the clouds were dropping
And the rain forgot how to bring salvation
The dogs were tune barking at the new moon
Whistling a new tune
Hoping it would come soon
So that they could die
