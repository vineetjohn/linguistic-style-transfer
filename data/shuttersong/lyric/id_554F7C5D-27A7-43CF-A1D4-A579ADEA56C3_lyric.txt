I'ts all the same.
Only the names will change, everyday
it seems were wasting away.
Another place, where the faces are so cold
I drive all night just to get back home.
I'm a cowboy. On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted, dead or alive.
Wanted, dead or alive.

Somtimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days.
Now people like me, must go their seperate ways.
Sometimes you'll tell the day, by the bottle that you drink.
Sometimes when your alone, all you do is think.

I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride.
I'm wanted (wanted), dead or alive.
Wanted (wanted,) dead or alive.

I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride.
I'm wanted (wanted), dead or alive.

Off these streets, a loaded six-string on my back
I play for keeps, 'cause I might not make it back.
I've been everywhere, standing tall
I've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all.

'Cause I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride.
I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive.
'Cause I'm a cowboy, I've got the night on my side.
I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive.
Dead or alive.
Dead or alive.
Dead or alive.
Dead or alive.
Dead or alive.
Dead or alive.
