Girls all in my bed and they don't trip off first impressions
Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions
I can't fuck with you no more cause you be actin' extra

All you niggas fightin' over crumbs, where the bread at
How they feel about you, where you're from, where your bed at

Got the key, now the doors open and we all goin' through it
Whole city at your head for the boy
