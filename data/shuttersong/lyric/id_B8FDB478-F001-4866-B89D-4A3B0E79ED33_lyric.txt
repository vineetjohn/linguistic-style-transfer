Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic Mister know it all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you 'cause
With the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share
This lonely view

With the birds I'll share
This lonely view

Push me up against the wall
Young Kentucky girl in a push up bra
Fallin' all over myself
To lick your heart and taste your health 'cause

With the birds I'll share
This lonely view, yeah

With the birds I'll share
This lonely view, yeah

With the birds I'll share
This lonely view

Blood loss in a bathroom stall
Southern girl with a scarlet drawl
Wave goodbye to ma and pa 'cause
With the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share
This lonely view, yeah

With the birds I'll share
This lonely view, yeah

Soft spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl
Autumn's sweet we call it fall
I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl

With the birds I'll share
This lonely view, yeah

With the birds I'll share
This lonely view, yeah
With the birds I'll share
This lonely view, yeah
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic Mister know it all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you 'cause
With the birds I'll share
With the birds I'll share
This lonely view, yeah
With the birds I'll share
This lonely view, yeah
With the birds I'll share
