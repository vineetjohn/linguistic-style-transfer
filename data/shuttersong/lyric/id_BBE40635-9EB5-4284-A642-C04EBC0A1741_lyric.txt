Dear Santa
It's me Ariana
I know it's been awhile but I really need
Your help this year
Let me make this clear
See I, I really love him

And it's been kinda tough cause
He's only in town for the holidays
Tomorrow he's flying away

Away from me
I don't need another gift
I just have one wish

This year can you
Just make it snow in California

I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace
Will be the perfect gift
Let it snow let it snow let it snow

Let it snow
In California
Dear Santa

What happened to the plan we had
I checked the news and it said
It'd be a sunny day
Make it go away
See I, I really need him to stay
For a couple more days

Can't you make his
Five o'clock flight delay
Won't you find a way

I don't need another gift
I just have one wish
This year can you
Just make it snow in california
I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace
Will be the perfect gift
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Let it snow
In California
I know I'm asking for the impossible
But I believe in miracles
I need my baby right here with me
So please, please
Just make it snow in California
I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace
Will be the perfect gift
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Let it snow
In California
