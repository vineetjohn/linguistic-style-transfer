Your gun went off
Well you shot off your mouth and look where it got you
My mouth runs on too
Shouts from both sides
Well we've got the land but they've got the view!
Well now here's the clue

Life it rents us
And yeah I hope it put plenty on you
Well I hope mine did too

As life gets longer, awful feels softer well it feels pretty soft to me
And if it takes shit to make bliss well I feel pretty blissfully

Your gun went off
Well you shot off your mouth and look where it got you
My mouth runs on too
Shouts from both sides
Well we've got the land but they've got the view!
Well now here's the clue

We are fixed right where we stand

Life it rents us
And yeah I hope it put plenty on you
Well I hope mine did too

We are fixed right where we are

As life gets longer, awful feels softer well it feels pretty soft to me
And if it takes shit to make bliss well I feel pretty blissfully

(For every invention made how much time did we save?)
(We're not much farther than we were in the cave)

As life gets longer, awful feels softer and it feels pretty soft to me
And if it takes shit to make bliss well I feel pretty blissfully
If life's not beautiful without the pain
Well I just would rather never ever even see beauty again
Well as life gets longer, awful feels softer and it feels pretty soft to me

(For every good deed done there is a crime committed)
We are fixed
(For every step ahead we could have just been seated)
We are fixed
As life gets longer, awful feels softer well it feels pretty soft to me
We are fixed
And if it takes shit to make bliss well I feel pretty blissfully
We are fixed
We are fixed
We are fixed
We are fixed right where we stand
