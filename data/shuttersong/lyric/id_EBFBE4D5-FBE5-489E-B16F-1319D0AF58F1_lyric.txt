Just shoot for the stars, if it feels right
Then aim for my heart, if you feel like
And take me away
And make it okay
I swear I'll behave

You wanted control, so we waited
I put on a show, now I'm naked
You say I'm a kid, my ego is big
I don't give a shit
And it goes like this

Take me by the tongue, and I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk, and I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes, and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

Maybe it's hard when you feel like
You're broken and scarred
Nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I make you believe
That I've got the key

Oh, so get in the car, we can ride it
Wherever you want, get inside it
And you want to steer
But I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here
And it goes like this

Take me by the tongue, and I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk, and I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes, and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

You want to know how to make me smile
Take control, own me just for the night
But if I share my secret
You gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this

So watch and learn, I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh, baby roll me right
But if I share my secret
You gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
And it goes like this

Take me by the tongue, and I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk, and I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes, and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
