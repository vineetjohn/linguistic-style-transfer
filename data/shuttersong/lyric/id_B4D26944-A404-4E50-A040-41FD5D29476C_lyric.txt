We're so late nights
Red eyes, amnesia, on ice
Late nights, red eyes, amnesia, I need ya

Right now I can't see straight
Intoxicated it's true
When I'm with you
I'm buzzing and I feel laced
I'm coming from a different phase
When I'm with you

Run away now
Like we're supposed to do
Take you to the back now
I take a shot for you
Wasted every night
Gone for every song
Faded every night
Dancing all night long

Drunk all Summer
Drunk all Summer
We be drunk all Summer
Drinking and flowing and rolling
We're falling down

We're so late nights
Red eyes, amnesia, on ice
Late nights, red eyes, amnesia, I need ya

Right now I'm emotional
I lose control, when I'm with you
I hope I haven't said too much
Guess I always push my luck when I'm with you

Run away now
Like we're supposed to do
Take you to the back now
I take a shot for you
Wasted every night
Gone for every song
Faded every night
Dancing all night long

Drunk all Summer
Drunk all Summer
We be drunk all Summer
Drinking and flowing and rolling
We're falling down

We're so late nights
Red eyes, amnesia, on ice
Late nights, red eyes, amnesia, I need ya

Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
(You put your drinks up)
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk all Summer
Drunk all Summer
