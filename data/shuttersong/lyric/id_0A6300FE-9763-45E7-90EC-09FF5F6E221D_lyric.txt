Oh look at me, so ordinary,
No mystery with no great capabilities
But I could make out as if I had it but you know
God, I'm so obvious and I should let it go
Oh I don't know, oooh

I'm no teenage icon
I'm no Frankie Avalon
I'm nobody's hero, oooh

Preserved and shy, your average guy
No piercing stare, just out of shape with messy hair
But I always figured I was somebody in wake,
And now I’m guessing that my woman must be late
'cause I need her, oooh

I'm no teenage icon
I'm no Frankie Avalon
I'm nobody's hero, oooh

I’m not magnetic or mythical
I’m suburban and typical
But I've got it, I've got it,
I’m overrun with it all, oooh

Seductive charm, a way with words
So effortless, not leather clad or dangerous
But I always did it like a real rebel would,
I had a photo where John Lennon may have stood,
or so I'm told, oooh

I'm no teenage icon
I'm no Frankie Avalon
I'm nobody's hero, oooh

I'm no teenage icon
I'm no Frankie Avalon
I'm nobody's hero, oooh
