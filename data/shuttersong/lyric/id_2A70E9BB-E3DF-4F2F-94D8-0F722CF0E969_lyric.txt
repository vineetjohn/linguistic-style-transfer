Love that once hung on the wall
Used to mean something, but now it means nothing
The echoes are gone in the hall
But I still remember, the pain of December

Oh, there isn't one thing left you could say
I'm sorry it's too late

I'm breaking free from these memories
Gotta let it go, just let it go
I've said goodbye, set it all on fire
Gotta let it go, just let it go
Oh (oh) Oh (oh)

You came back to find I was gone
And that place is empty, like the hole that was left in me
Like we were nothing at all
It's not what you meant to me, thought we were meant to be

Oh, there isn't one thing left you could say
I'm sorry it's too late

I'm breaking free from these memories
Gotta let it go, just let it go
I've said goodbye, set it all on fire
Gotta let it go, just let it go

(And let it go) And now I know
(A brand new life) Is down this road
(And when it's right) You always know
(So this time) I won't let go

There's only one thing left here to say
Love's never too late
I've broken free from those memories
I've let it go, I've let it go
And two goodbyes led to this new life
Don't let me go, don't let me go
Oh (oh) Oh (oh) Oh (oh)
Don't let me go Won't let you go
Don't let me go
