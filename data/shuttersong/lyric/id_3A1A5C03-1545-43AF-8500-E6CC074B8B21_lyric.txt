Sittin' in the mornin' sun
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' comes
Watching the ships come in
And I watch 'em sail away again

Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay wastin' time

I left my home in Georgia
For the San Francisco bay
I felt I had nothing to live for
But I know something's gonna come my way

So I'll just sit here on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Sittin' on the dock of the bay wastin' time

Yeah, and it looks like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, yeah

Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
I'm too tired for having fun
So I'll be sittin' when the evenin' comes 

Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh, sittin' on the dock of the bay wastin' time

Oh, where were you, baby?
Nothing's gonna change
Yeah, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Everything's the same

Nothin', no, no, nothin's gonna change, baby
I ain't gonna change
I'm just gonna sit here
Sit, sit, sittin' on the dock of the bay
