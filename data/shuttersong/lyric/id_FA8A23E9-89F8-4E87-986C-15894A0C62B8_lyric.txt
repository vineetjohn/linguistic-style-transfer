Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say
"Baby, I love you"

If you ain't runnin'
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't calling me baby

Why the sudden change
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say

"Baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game

Say my name, my name
Say my name, my name
Any other day, I would call
You would say, "Baby, how's your day?"
But today, ain't the same
Every other word is "uh-huh," "yeah okay"
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
And if you took it there, first of all, let me say
I am not the one to sit around and be played

So prove yourself to me, I'm the one that you claim
Why don't you say the things you said to me yesterday
I won't let you say I'm assuming things
If something's going down, that's the way it seems
It shouldn't be the reason why you actin' strange
Yeah, nobody's holding you back from me
'Cause I know how you usually do
When you say everything to me times two

Why can't you just tell the truth
If somebody's there, then tell me who
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say
"Baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game

Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't calling me baby
Why the sudden

Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say

"Baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin' games (oh no)
Say my name, my name (My name)
I know they say that some things are better left unsaid
And it wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
(Oh no no)

All of these things people told me keep messing with my head
You should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it
But you don't have to say just what you did
I already know
I found out from him

Now there's just no chance for you and me
And there'll never be
And don't it make you sad
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me, all alone
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me, on the phone
Girl I refuse, you must have me confused

With some other guy
Your bridges were burned, and now it's your turn
To cry
So cry me a river
Just cry me a river (oh no)

Just cry me a river
Cry me, cry me
You say yeah yeah
You say yeah yeah
You say yeah yeah
You say yeah yeah
I say no no
You say yeah yeah

I say no no
You say no no no
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say
"Baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin'
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't calling me baby
Why the sudden change
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say
"Baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game (oh no)
Say my name, my name
Say my name then cry me a river(My name)
Say my name then cry me a river(My name)
Say my name then cry me a river
