Boy, look at you looking at me
I know you know how I feel
Loving you is hard, being here is harder
You take the wheel
I don't wanna do this anymore
It's so surreal, I can't survive
If this is all that's real

All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby, bye, bye
The truth is I never
Bought into your bullshit
When you would be pay tribute to me

Cause I know that

All I wanna do is get high by the beach

Get high baby, baby, bye, bye

Boy look at you
Looking at me
I know you don't understand
You could be a bad motherfucker
But that don't make you a man
Now you're just another one of my problems
Because you got out of hand
We won't survive
We're sinking into the sand
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby, bye, bye
The truth is I never
Bought into your bullshit
When you would be pay tribute to me
Cause I know that
All I wanna do to us get high by the beach
Get high baby, baby, bye, bye
Lights camera action
I'll do it on my own
Don't need your money, money
To get me what I want
Lights camera action
I'll do it on my own
Don't need your money, money
To get me what I want
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby, bye, bye
The truth is I never
Bought into your bullshit
When you would be pay tribute to me
Cause I know that
All I wanted to do is get high by the beach
Get high baby, baby, bye, bye
High
High
High
High
Everyone can start again
Not through love but through revenge
Through the fire, we're born again
Peace by patience
Brings the end
