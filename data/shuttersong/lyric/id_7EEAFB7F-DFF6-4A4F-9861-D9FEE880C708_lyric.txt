1, 2, 3, 4.

Hey, hey, oh...
Hey, hey, oh...

It's you and me
Moving at the speed of light into eternity, yeah,
Tonight is the night to join me in the middle of ecstasy.
Feel the melody in the rhythm of the music around you, around you
Imma take you there, Imma take you there
So don't be scared
I'm right here, baby
We can go anywhere, go anywhere
But first it's your chance,
Take my hand come with me

[Chorus:]
It's like I've waited my whole life for this one night
It's gon' be me you and the dance floor
'Cause we've only got one night
Double your pleasure
Double your fun and dance
Forever (ever, ever)
Forever (ever, ever)
Forever (ever, ever)
Forever, girl, forever
Forever (ever, ever)
Forever (ever, ever)
Forever (ever, ever)
Forever on the dance floor

Feels like we're on another level
Feels like our love's intertwined,
We can be two rebels breaking the rules
Me and you, you and I
All you got to do is watch me
Look what I can do with my feet
Baby, feel the beat inside,
I'm driving, you can take the front seat
Just need you to trust me
Oh, ah, oh
It's like!

[Chorus]

It's a long way down,
We're so high off the ground,
Sending for an angel to bring me your heart
Girl, where did you come from?
Got me so undone,
Gazing in your eyes got me singing what a beautiful lady
No ifs, ands or maybes
I'm releasing my heart and it's feeling amazing
There's no one else that matters
You love me and I won't let you fall, girl
Let you fall, girl, oh
Ah, ah, yeah, yeah
I won't let you fall, let you fall
Let you fall oh oh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
It's like...

[Chorus]

Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Yeah
Forever (ever, ever, ever)
Forever, ever, ah.
