I don't know just how it happened
I let down my guard
Swore I'd never fall in love again
But I fell hard

Guess I should have seen it coming
Caught me by surprise
Wasn't looking where I was going
I fell into your eyes

You came into my crazy world
Like a cool and cleansing wave
Before I, I knew what hit me baby
You were flowing through my veins

I'm addicted to you
Hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug
I can't get enough of

Lost in your eyes
Drowning in blue
Out of control
What can I do?
I'm addicted to you

Midnight blows in through the window
Dances 'round the room
Got me hypnotized
I'm getting high on the perfume

I couldn't live without you now
Oh, I know I'd go insane
I wouldn't last one night alone, baby
I couldn't stand the pain

I'm addicted to you
Hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug
I can't get enough of

Lost in your eyes
Drowning in blue
Out of control
What can I do?
I'm addicted to you
