Oh, you waited so long
Sometimes it's hard to stand out
And you don't have to do anything else
But be yourself

You, you dressed up so nice
But all I could see was your eyes
And the crowd came and pulled you away
And then you were gone
Ooh, yeah

And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me everyday
'Cause I don't even know your name

Oh, everywhere that I go
I see your face and it kills me to know
That you never know what you did to me
And now you're gone
Yeah, I can't stop thinkin' bout' you

'Cause I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me everyday
'Cause I don't even know your name
Yeah, I don't even know your name

I'm running, I'm searching
And I don't know where to start
I'm dying, my love, you punched a hole right through my heart
I won't stop, stop looking
'Till I hold you in my arms
'Cause I'm running, I'm running, I'm running
I'm running, I'm searching

And I don't know where to start
I'm dying, my love, you punched a hole right through my heart
I won't stop, stop looking
'Till I hold you in my arms
'Cause I'm running, I'm running, I'm running
And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me everyday
'Cause I don't even know your name
