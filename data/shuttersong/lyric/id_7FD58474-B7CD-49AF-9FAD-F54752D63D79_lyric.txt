I'm just the boy inside the man, not exactly who you think I am
Trying to trace my steps back here again, so many times
I'm just a speck inside your head, you came and made me who I am
I remember where it all began, so clearly

I feel a million miles away, still you connect me in your way
And you create in me, something I would've never seen
When I can only see the floor, you made my window a door
So when they say they don't believe, I hope that they see you and me
After all the lights go down, I'm just the words you are the sound
A strange type of chemistry, how you've become a part of me
And when I sit alone at night, your thoughts burn through me like a fire
You're the only one who knows, who I really am

We all wanna be somebody, we just need a taste of who we are
We all wanna be somebody, we're willing to gamble but not that far

And we're all see through, just like glass
And we can shatter just as fast
That light's been burned out for a while, I still see it every time I pass
It was lost in the coldness of my mind, behind a box of reasons why
I never doubted it was there, just took a little time to find
And even when...

I feel a million miles away, still you connect me in your way
And you create in me, something I would've never seen
When I can only see the floor, you made my window a door
So when they say they don't believe I hope that they see you and me
After all the lights go down, I'm just the words you are the sound
A strange type of chemistry, and you've become a part of me
And when I sit alone at night, your thoughts burn through me like a fire
You're the only one who knows, who I really am

We all wanna be somebody, we just need a taste of who we are
We all wanna be somebody, we're willing to gamble but not that far
We all wanna be somebody, (be somebody) we just need a taste of who we are
We all wanna be somebody, (be somebody) we're willing to gamle but not that far
I'm just the boy inside the man, not exactly who you think I am
Trying to trace my steps back here again, so many times
When I can only see the floor, you made my window a door
So when they say they don't believe, I hope that they see you and me
