(eh eh eh oh eh eh eh
eh eh eh oh eh eh eh)
It never crossed my mind at all
That's what I tell myself
What we had has come and gone
You're better off with someone else

It's for the best, I know it is
But I see you
Sometimes I try to hide

What I feel inside
And I turn around
You're with him now
I just can't figure it out
Tell me why

You're so hard to forget
Don't remind me
I'm not over it
Tell me why
I can't seem to face the truth
I'm just a little too not over you

(eh eh eh oh eh eh eh)
Not over you
(eh eh eh oh eh eh eh)

Memories
Supposed to fade
What's wrong with my heart?
Shake it off, let it go

Didn't think it be this hard
Should be strong
Moving on
But I see you
Sometimes I try to hide

What I feel inside
And I turn around
You're with him now

I just can't figure it out
Tell me why
You're so hard to forget
Don't remind me

I'm not over it
Tell me why
I can't seem to face the truth
I'm just a little too not over you
Maybe I regret
Everything I said
No way to take it all back, yeah
Now I'm on my own
How I let you go
I'll never understand
I'll never understand
Yeah, oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooooooh
Oh
Ooooh, oh
Tell me why
You're so hard to forget
Don't remind me
I'm not over it
Tell me why
I can't seem to face the truth
I'm just a little too not over you
Tell me why
You're so hard to forget
Don't remind me
I'm not over it
Tell me why
I can't seem to face the truth
And I really don't know what to do
I'm just a little too not over you
(eh eh eh oh eh eh eh)
Not over you
(eh eh eh oh eh eh eh)
