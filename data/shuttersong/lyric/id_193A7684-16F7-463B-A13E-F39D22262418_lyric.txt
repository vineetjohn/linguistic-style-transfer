This Is What It Takes - Shawn Mendes
I watch your troubled eyes as you rest
And I fall in love with every breath
Wonder if those eyes are really shut
And am I the one you're dreaming of
Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
And I know this cause I notice
A little bit shining through the seems
And if this is what it takes
Then let me be the one to bear the pain
If this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way
If this is what it takes
You keep on telling me I'm wasting time
But call it wasting time  oh that's a crime
And you think it's crazy what I'm tryna do
Well baby  I'm a fool for you
Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
And I know this cause I notice
A little bit shining through the seems
And if this is what it takes
Then let me be the one to bear the pain
If this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way
Cause if you don't understand yet
Then I'll never let you forget
That you don't have to do this on your own
I'll be your shoulder to lean on
I'll be your right when you feel wrong
So c'mon take my hand  we're moving on
And if this is what it takes
Then let me be the one to bear the pain
And if this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls these walls that are in our way
This is what it takes
