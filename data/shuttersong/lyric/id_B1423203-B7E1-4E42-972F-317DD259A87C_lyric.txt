Take me to the docks, there's a ship without a name there

And it is sailing to the middle of the sea

 
The water there is deeper than anything you've ever seen

Jump right in and swim until you're free

 
I will remember your face

'Cause I am still in love with that place

 
But when the stars are the only things we share

Will you be there?

 
Money came like rain to your hands while you were waiting

For that cold long promise to appear

 
People in the churches started singing above their hands

They say, "My God is a good God and He cares"

 
I will remember your face

'Cause I am still in love with that place

When the stars are the only things we share

Will you be there?
