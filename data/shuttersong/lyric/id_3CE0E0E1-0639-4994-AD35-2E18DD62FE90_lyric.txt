If I could fly
I'd be coming right back home to you
I think I might
Give up everything just ask me to
Pay attention, I hope that you listen
Cause I've let my guard down
Right now I'm completly defenceless

For your eyes only
I'll show you my heart
For when you're lonely
And forget who you are
I'm missing half of me
When we're apart
Now you know me
For your eyes only
For your eyes only

I've got scars
Even though they can't always be seen
And pain gets hard
But now you're here and I don't feel a thing

Pay attention and I hope that you listen
Cause I've let my guard down
Right now I'm completly defenceless

For your eyes only
I'll show you my heart
For when you're lonely
And forget who you are
I'm missing half of me
When we're apart
Now you know me
For your eyes only
For your eyes only

I can feel your heart inside of mine
I feel it
I feel it
I've been going out of my mind
I feel it
I feel it
Know that I'm just wasting time
And I hope that you don't run from me

For your eyes only
I'll show you my heart
For when you're lonely
And forget who you are
I'm missing half of me
When we're apart
Now you know me
For your eyes only

For your eyes only
I'll show you my heart
For when you're lonely
And forget who you are
I'm missing half of me
When we're apart
Now you know me
For your eyes only
For your eyes only
For you eyes only
