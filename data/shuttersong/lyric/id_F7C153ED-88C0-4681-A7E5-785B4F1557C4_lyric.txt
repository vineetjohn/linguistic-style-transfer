Coming up slowly, our sun out of the hill
Daylight's still a longtime coming, but I know it will
Been out of this spell, oh, but we're coming away
So we'll be rude, we'll be loud
As long as it takes

This is why, this is why
We crank the dial to the right
Oh, this is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right

Sing!
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Different colors
Ooh, ooh, ooh
We carry each other
Ooh, ooh, ooh
We're just different colors
This is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right

We keep cranking the music up
Driving through our town
But they don't wanna hear
They want us to turn it down
So come on lovers
Come on haters
Tonight we raise a fire
'Cause when the people get to dancin'
They forget about taking sides

This is why, this is why
We crank the dial to the right
Oh, this is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right

Sing!
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Different colors
Ooh, ooh, ooh
We carry each other
Ooh, ooh, ooh
We're just different colors
This is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right

We're coming away
Out of your spell
As long as it takes
We're coming away

We're coming away
Out of your spell
As long as it takes
We're coming away

This is why, this is why
We crank the dial to the right
This is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right
I said, this is why, this is why
We turn it up all night
Oh, this is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Different colors
Ooh, ooh, ooh
We carry each other
Ooh, ooh, ooh
We're just different colors
This is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right
Different colors
We carry each other (oh yeah)
We're just different colors
This is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right
