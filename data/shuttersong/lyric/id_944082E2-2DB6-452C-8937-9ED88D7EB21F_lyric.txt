I got a heart, and I got a soul
Believe me, I will use them both
We made a start
Be it a false one, I know
Baby, I don't want to feel alone

So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms are made for holding you, oh
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18

We took a chance
God knows we tried
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine
So pour me a drink, oh love
And let's split the night wide open, and we'll see everything
Living love in slow motion, motion, motion

So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
And all I can do is say that these arms are made for holding you, oh
And I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18

I wanna love like you made me feel

When we were 18
Oh Lord, when we were 18

Kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
And all I can do is say that these arms are made for holding you
And I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18

I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18
