Ding Dong Ding Dong Ding
Ding Dong Ding Dong Ding
Ding Dong Ding Dong Ding
Ding Dong Ding Dong Ding

Hark how the bells, 
Sweet silver bells, 
All seem to say, 
Throw cares away

Christmas is here, 
Bringing good cheer, 
To young and old, 
Meek and the bold, 

Ding, dong, ding, dong
That is their song
With joyful ring 
All caroling
One seems to hear
Words of good cheer
From ev'rywhere
Filling the air

Oh how they pound, 
Raising the sound, 
O'er hill and dale, 
Telling their tale, 

Gaily they ring
While people sing
Songs of good cheer, 
Christmas is here, 
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas, 
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas, 

Hark how the bells, 
Sweet silver bells, 
All seem to say, 
Throw cares away

Christmas is here, 
Bringing good cheer, 
To young and old, 
Meek and the bold, 

Ding, dong, ding, dong
That is their song
With joyful ring 
All caroling
One seems to hear
Words of good cheer
From ev'rywhere
Filling the air
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas, 
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas, 
 
On on they send, 
On without end, 
Their joyful tone to every home

Ding Dong Ding Dong Ding
Ding Dong Ding Dong Ding

Christmas is here, 
Bringing good cheer, 
To young and old, 
Meek and the bold, 

Ding, dong, ding, dong
That is their song
With joyful ring...
