In the land of Gods and Monsters,
I was an Angel.
Living in the garden of evil,
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I Needed.
Shining like a fiery beacon,
You got that medicine I need
Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly.
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly.
Me and God we don't get along, so now I sing.

No one's gonna take my soul away,
I'm living like Jim Morrison.
Headed towards a fucked up holiday.
Motel, squeeze, squeeze, and I'm singing;
Fuck yeah give it to me, this is heaven, what I Truly want
It's innocence lost. Innocence lost.

In the land of gods and monsters,
I was an Angel,
Lookin' to get fucked hard.
Like a groupie incognito posing as a real singer,
Life imitates art
You got that medicine I need
Dope, shoot it up straight to the heart please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said 'baby that's alright with me'.

No one's gonna take my soul away,
Living like Jim Morrison.
Headed towards a fucked up holiday.
Motel, sprees, sprees, and I'm singing;
Fuck yeah give it to me, this is heaven, what I Truly want
It's innocence lost. Innocence lost.

When you talk it's like a movie
Making me go crazy
'Cause life imitates art
If I'll get a little pretty
Can I be your baby?
And tell me life isn't that hard.

No one's gonna take my soul away,
Living like Jim Morrison.
Headed towards a fucked up holiday.
Motel, sprees, sprees, and I'm singing;
Fuck yeah give it to me, this is heaven, what I Truly want
It's innocence lost. Innocence lost.
