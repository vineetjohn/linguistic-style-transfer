Let em know that we're still Rock n Roll...

I don't care about my makeup

I like it better with my jeans all ripped up
Don't know how to keep my mouth shut
You say 'so what' (what)

I don' t care if I'm misfit
I like it better than the hipster of all sh*t
I am a mother f-cking princess
You still love me

Some some how
It's a little different when
I'm with you
You know what I really am
On the phone
You know how it really goes...
Some some way
We'll be getting out of this
Time one day
You're the only that I
Want with me
You know how the story goes...

When it's you and me
We don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turning up the radio
When it's you and I
Just put up a middle finger to the sky
Let them know we're still Rock ¡®n Roll
Rock ¡®n Roll
Hey hey hey
Rock ¡®n Roll
Hey Hey Hey

Don't get a bad attitude dude
I'm never going to cover up that tattoo
I might have a couple issues
You say 'me too' (yeah)
Don't care about a reputation
Must be living in the wrong generation
This is your invitation
Let's get wasted

Some some how
It's a little different when
I'm with you
You know what I really am
On the phone
You know how the story goes

When it's you and me
We don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turning up the radio
When it's you and I
Just put up a middle finger to the sky
Let them know we're still Rock ¡®n Roll
Rock ¡®n Roll
Hey hey hey
Rock ¡®n Roll
Hey hey hey

When it's you and me
We don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turning up the radio

When it's you and I
Just put up a middle finger to the sky
Let them know we're still Rock ¡®n Roll

When it's you and me
We don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turning up the radio

When it's you and I
Just put up a middle finger to the sky
Let them know we're still Rock ¡®n Roll

Rock ¡®n Roll
Hey hey hey
Rock ¡®n Roll
Hey hey hey...
