She would not show that she was afraid
But being and feeling alone was too much to face
Though everyone said that she was so strong
What they didn't know was that she could barely carry on

But she knew that she would be okay
So she didn't let it get in her way
Sometimes it all gets a little too much

But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much

She would always tell herself she could do this
She would use no help it would be just fine
But when it got hard she would lose her focus
So take my hand and it will be alright
And she knew that she would be okay
So she didn't let it get in her way
Sometimes it all gets a little too much

But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much
Sometimes it all gets a little too much

But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much
Sometimes it all gets a little too much

But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much
