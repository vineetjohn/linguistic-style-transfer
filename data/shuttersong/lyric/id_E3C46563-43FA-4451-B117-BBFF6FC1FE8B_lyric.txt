They say if I get paid then I'll be fine
But I can't get by on anything but you
I know if I smoke then I might die
But I won't die for anything but you

I found a shooting star in the pocket of my jeans
I won the lottery and built a time machine
I got everything, and everything is mine to lose
But I don't want anything but you

They say great things come if you wait
But I won't wait for anything but you
Free falls and alcohol, I've paid my dues
Now I can't get high on anything but you

I found a shooting star in the pocket of my jeans
I won the lottery and built a time machine
I got everything, and everything is mine to lose
But I don't want anything but you

Ooo, ooo, ooo

A cardboard box of make believe
Empty pockets full of dreams
And you are everything I need

I never found a shooting star and there's holes in my jeans
I didn't win the lottery or build a time machine
I never had much at all but I still got everything to lose
Cause I don't want anything
I never found a shooting star and there's holes in my jeans

I didn't win the lottery or build a time machine
I never had much at all but I still got everything to lose

Cause I don't want anything
Cause I don't want anything

But you
