I'm alive
'Cause Jesus gave me life
He opened up my eyes
I can see clearly now

Oh, everybody dance now, oh

Everybody, give it up for Jesus
Give Him glory, for He has redeemed us
Everybody, give it up for Jesus
Praise His name

My desire
Is to lift You higher
It's only burning brighter
This passion inside of me

Oh, everybody dance now, oh

Everybody, give it up for Jesus
Give Him glory, for He has redeemed us
Everybody, give it up for Jesus
Praise His name
[x2]

This praise is bursting out
And I can't contain it now
This praise is bursting out
Out, out, 1, 2, let's go

Everybody, give it up for Jesus
Give Him glory, for He has redeemed us
Everybody, give it up for Jesus
Praise His name
[x2]
