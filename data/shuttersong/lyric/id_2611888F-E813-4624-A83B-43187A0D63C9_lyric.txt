Have you ever had the feeling you're drawn to someone? Yeah
And there isn't anything they could've said or done?
And everyday I see you on your own
And I can't believe that you're alone
But I overheard your girls and this is what they said

Looking for a, looking for a
That you're looking for a boyfriend, I see that

Give me time, you know, I'm gonna be there
Don't be scared to come, put your trust in me
Can't you see all I really want to be
Is your boyfriend, can't fight that
Let me down, you know, I'm coming right back
I don't care at all what you done before

So when I kick it you it ain't something that you've heard
I don't know what kind of guy that you prefer
But I know I gotta put myself for worse

See I think got the kind of love that you deserve and I heard that
That you're looking for a boyfriend, I see that
Give me time, you know, I'm gonna be there
