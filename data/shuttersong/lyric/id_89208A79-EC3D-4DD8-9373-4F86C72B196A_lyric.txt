I can't look at you in the same light
Knowing what you did in my heart doesn't feel right
Yeah, my head's been tripping all night
I need another point of view
I got a friend who's committed to sci-fi
He's read every comic he's addicted to Twilight
He'll give you the Goosebumps, but he's never lead me wrong
He said, she's got a method of kidding
Pulling you in like you're gonna start kissing
Fooling around until you've lost all feeling
Sucking your blood until your heart stops beating

Before we started, it was over
I feel our bodies getting colder
She gives me, a feeling that I can't fight
And it's the road that leads to nowhere
But all I want to do is go there
She's got me, running from the daylight
Daylight

I got a taste for it and I'm obsessed
Lying here no fear of the darkness
Now I'm not happy unless, I'm close enough to you
And all these dreams I'm dreaming
Freaking me out I wish I knew the meaning
Doesn't make sense because I'm just not seeing
How I'm alive it feels like I'm not breathing

Before we started it was over
I feel our bodies getting colder
She gives me, a feeling that I can't fight

And it's the road that leads to nowhere
But all I want to do is go there
She's got me, running from the daylight
Daylight

I'm not ready to start again
And you're not willing to make amends
Now the daylight's dangerous
It will turn us both to dust

I'm not ready to start again
And you're not willing to make amends
Now the daylight's dangerous
And it is much too late for us

Before we started it was over
I feel our bodies getting colder
She gives me, a feeling that I can't fight

And it's the road that leads to nowhere
But all I want to do is go there
She's got me, running from the daylight
Daylight
I feel our bodies getting colder
She gives me, a feeling that I can't fight
And it's the road that leads to nowhere
But all I want to do is go there
She's got me, running from the daylight
Daylight
