Whenever I close my eyes, I picture you there
I'm looking out at the crowd, you're everywhere
I'm watching you from the stage, yeah
Your smile is on every face now
But every time you wake up
You're hearing me say

[Harry:]
Goodbye.

[All:]
Baby, you don't have to worry
I'll be coming back for you, back for you, back for you, you
Lately, I've been going crazy
So I'm coming back for you, back for you, back for you, you.

[Louis:]
I've never been so into somebody before
And every time we both touch I only want more
So tell me nothing's gonna change yeah
And you won't ever walk away, yeah
Cause even though every night you'll know what I'll say
