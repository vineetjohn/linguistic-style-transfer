Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no trauble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no trouble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass

Yeah it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
But I can shake it, shake it like I'm supposed to do
Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
All the right junk in all the right places
I see the magazines working that Photoshop
We know that shit ain't real
Come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty beauty just raise 'em up
Cause every inch of you is perfect

From the bottom to the top
Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size
She says, boys they like a little more booty to hold at night
You know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll
So, if that's what's you're into

Then go ahead and move along
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble

I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass
I'm bringing booty back
Go ahead and tell them skinny bitches
Hey No, I'm just playing I know you think you're fat
But I'm here to tell you that

Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top
Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size
She says, boys they like a little more booty to hold at night
