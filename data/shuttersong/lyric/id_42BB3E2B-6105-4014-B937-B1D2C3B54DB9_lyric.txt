I can barely sleep
There's something on my mind
I'm lying in the dark
I'm searching hard to find
For the love that we shared
And the life I left behind
There's only beautiful excuses in my eyes

I can scream and shout
But what's the point? it's done
Don't try before you learn
Fly too close to the sun
You're starting to lose faith
So hold on to your pride
There's only beautiful excuses in my eyes

What makes an angel fall in love?
What makes a good man turn and run?
How do you know if she's the one?

I've made all the perfect alibies
And I've sugar coated my disguise
But I can't cover this up
With sweet goodbyes, no
There's only beautiful excuses in my eyes

She's wrapped up in her thoughts
We haven't spoke in days
She's saying that I've changed
Well she's stuck in her ways
I won't pick up the phone
I've said all there is to say
Gotta be strong

Because it's wrong for me to stay
What makes an angel fall in love?
What makes a good man turn and run?

How do you know if she's the one?
I've made all the perfect alibies
And I've sugar coated my disguise
But I can't cover this up
With sweet goodbyes, no

There's only beautiful excuses in my eyes
Too many beautiful excuses
Tell me what the use is
Trying to find a way to come back home
How can we correct this if we're disconnected?
I don't know, I don't know.

What makes an angel fall in love?
What makes a good man turn and run?
How do you know if she's the one?
I've made all the perfect alibies
And I've sugar coated my disguise
But I can't cover this up
With sweet goodbyes, no
There's only beautiful excuses in my eyes
