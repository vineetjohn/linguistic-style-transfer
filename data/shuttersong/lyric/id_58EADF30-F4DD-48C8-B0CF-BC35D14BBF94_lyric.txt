'Cause I've been doing forensics
On your body in this club
Now I can tell the way you walk banned
Ain't been touched the right way

It seems your man been treating you like a step child
Some of 'em are out, some are in
And I'mma get on the floor
And shut the whole game down
Until I hear you cheering, babe
Have you spelled out my name, babe
See, I wanna give you all my love
Be your dope man in the bedroom
You can make me your drug, babe

And it don't make no sense to be that bad
