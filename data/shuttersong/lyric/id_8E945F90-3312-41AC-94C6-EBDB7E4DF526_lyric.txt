Your mouth is a revolver firing bullets in the sky
Your love is like a soldier, loyal till you die
And I've been looking at the stars for a long, long time
I've been putting out fires all my life
Everybody wants a flame, but they don't want to get burnt
And today is our turn

Days like these lead to
Nights like this lead to
Love like ours
You light the spark in my bonfire heart

People like us, we don't
Need that much

Just someone that starts
Starts the spark in our bonfire hearts
This world is getting colder, strangers passing by
No one offers you a shoulder, no one looks you in the eye
But I've been looking at you for a long, long time
Just trying to break through, trying to make you mine

Everybody wants a flame, they don't want to get burnt
Well today is our turn
Days like these lead to
Nights like this lead to

Love like ours
You light the spark in my bonfire heart
People like us, we don't

Need that much
Just someone that starts

Starts the spark in our bonfire hearts
(Our bonfire heart)
(Our bonfire heart)
(Our bonfire heart)

(You light the spark)
People like us, we don't

Need that much
Just someone that starts
Starts the spark in our bonfire hearts
Days like these lead to
Nights like this lead to
Love like ours
You light the spark in my bonfire heart
People like us, we don't
Need that much
Just someone that starts
Starts the spark in our bonfire hearts
(Our bonfire hearts)
Days like these lead to
Nights like this lead to
Love like ours
You light the spark in my bonfire heart
People like us, we don't
Need that much
Just someone that starts
Starts the spark in our bonfire hearts
