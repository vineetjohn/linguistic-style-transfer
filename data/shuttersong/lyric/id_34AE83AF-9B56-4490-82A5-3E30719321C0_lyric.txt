Now put your hands up
Up in the club, we just broke up
I´m doing my own little thing
Decided to dip and now you wanna trip
'Cause another brother noticed me

I´m up on him, he up on me
Don´t pay him any attention
Just cried my tears, for three good years
You can´t be mad at me

'Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it
Don´t be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it

Oh, oh, oh.

If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it
Don´t be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it

I got gloss on my lips, a man on my hips
Got me tighter in my Dereon jeans
Acting up, drink in my cup
I can care less what you think

I need no permission, did I mention
Don´t pay him any attention
'Cause you had your turn and now you gonna learn
What it really feels like to miss me

'Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it
Don´t be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it

Oh, oh, oh...

If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it
Don´t be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it

Oh, oh, oh...

Don´t treat me to the things of the world
I´m not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve

Here´s a man that makes me, then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms, say I´m the one you own
If you don´t, you´ll be alone and like a ghost I'll be gone
