Baby came home today
Told me to stay away
She told me her man was afraid,
Told me i better behave,
Baby just came back around,
Told me she's leaving this town,
Said she needs time to explore,
She said I can't love her no more

Thinking about her
She's gone all the time
I think if you found her
That even you would know...

So baby packed up all she had,
Promised to never come back,
She left me alone and without,
Skin i could study about,
Tiles get colder to touch,
Wood splinters, metal will rust,
But baby, she had all my trust,
And I guess that was never enough

Thinking about her
She's gone all the time
I think if you found her
That even you would know she's mine.

(Whoa, oh oh. You know that she's mine, ooh.
Baby came home today
Told me to stay away
Told me her man was afraid
Told me I better behave)

(Oh, no no, I'm)

Thinkin' about her
She's gone all the time
I think if you found her
That even you would know she's mine
She's mine
That girl is mine, she's mine, oh
