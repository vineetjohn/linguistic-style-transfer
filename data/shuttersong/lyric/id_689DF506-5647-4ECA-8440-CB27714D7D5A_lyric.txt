It's a holiday (yeah, yeah yeah)

Spend it with you
I think that I am in love this Christmas (yeah)
Just hang your stockings on the fireplace
You know that Santa's coming to town
I'm the one who wants to take you on a sleigh, right now
So today is all about you babe
The mistletoe can pull us closer
It's what I'm waiting for
It sorta feels like it's Valentine's, Valentine's
So in on top of your roof
Them sleigh bells is ringing
I'll be up all night with you
Don't care what they're saying
Japan to Peru, baby me and you
This Christmas Eve

Be my date this Christmas Eve
Be my holiday, my dream

Lay your head on me
I got you babe, whoa oh
Kissing underneath the tree
I don't need no presents girl

You're everything I need
Let me give you all of me
Together on this Christmas Eve

You leave some cookies out,
I'ma eat 'em up
Nobody can see me but you
It's so magical
When we use imagination,

We can fly to never never land
The North Pole, ain't that cold
If you wanna go
I got you baby

Be my date this Christmas Eve
Be my holiday, my dream
Lay your head on me
I got you babe, whoa oh
Kissing underneath the tree

I don't need no presents girl
You're everything I need
Let me give you all of me
Together on this Christmas Eve

Be my, be my, Christmas Eve
Be my, be my, Christmas Christmas
Be my, be my, Christmas Eve
I promise I won't do you wrong

Be my date this Christmas Eve
(Be my baby
Be my holiday, my dream
(Oooh, lay your head on me)
I got you babe
(Whoa no no no whoa oh)
Kissing underneath the tree
(I just hold you right)
I don't need no presents girl
You're everything I need
(Oooh)

Together on this Christmas Eve
