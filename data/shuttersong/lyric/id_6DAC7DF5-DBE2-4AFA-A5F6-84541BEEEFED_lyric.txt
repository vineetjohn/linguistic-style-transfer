Come to me, in all your glamour and cruelty
Just do that thing that you do
And I'll undress you

Keep it tight, sometimes the simplest move is right
The melody that you choose
Can rescue you

A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything

We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)

We could, we could, belong together
ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP

Come to me, without your subjects and fantasy
Just do that thing that you do
In that peverse hue

Lovers kites, Are flown on beaches for public sight
The color palette you choose
Can profit you

A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything

Could try to sell you out or I
Could show you all the reasons why
My ARTPOP could mean anything

We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could, belong together
ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP

Brushes with darkness won't help you create
Your destiny of self but ARTPOP could mean anything
A-ny-thing...

I try to sell myself but I am really laughing
Because I just love the music, not the bling
Music, not the bling

We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could, belong together
ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could, belong together
ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP

Free my mind, ARTPOP
You make my heart stop...
