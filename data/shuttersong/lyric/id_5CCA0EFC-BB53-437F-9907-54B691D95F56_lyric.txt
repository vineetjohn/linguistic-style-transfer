That's right, pleased to meet you
I still won't tell you my name
Don't you believe in mystery?
Don't you wanna play my game?

I'm lookin' for a man to love me
Like I never been loved before
I'm lookin' for a man that'll do it anywhere
Even on a limousine floor 'cause

Tonight I'm livin' in a fantasy
My own little nasty world
Tonight, don't you wanna come with me
Do you think I'm a nasty girl?

Tonight I'm livin' in a fantasy
My own little nasty world
Tonight, don't you wanna come with me
Do you think I'm a nasty girl?

I guess I'm just used to sailors
I think they got water on the brain
I think they got more water upstairs
Than they got sugar on a candy cane

That's right, it's been a long time
Since I had a man that did it real good
If you ain't scared, take it out
I'll do it like a real live nasty girl should

Tonight I'm livin' in a fantasy
My own little nasty world
Tonight, don't you wanna come with me
Do you think I'm a nasty girl?

Oh, I don't like this groove
Try and give me something I can croon to
Catch my drift

That'll work

That's right, I can't control it
I need 7 inches or more
Tonight I can no longer hold it
Get it up, get it up, I can't wait anymore
