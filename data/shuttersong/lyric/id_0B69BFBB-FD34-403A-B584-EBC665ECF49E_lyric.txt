All brawn and no brains
And all those nice things
You FINALLY got what you want
Someone to look good with
AND light your cigarette
Is this what you really want?

I figured out what you're all about
And I don't think I like what I see
SOOOOO ...
I HOPE I won't be there in the end
if you come around.

How long will he last
Before he's a CREEP in the past
And you're alone once again?
Will you pop up AGAIN and be my
"SPECIAL FRIEND" 'till the end?
And when will that be?

I figured out what you're all about
And I don't think I like what I see
SOOOOO ...
I HOPE I won't be there in the end
if you come around.
