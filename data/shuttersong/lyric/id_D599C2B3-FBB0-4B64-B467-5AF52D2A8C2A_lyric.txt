I think I talk too much
I need to listen, baby
I need to listen, baby
I need to listen good
I think I try too hard
How I look, what I do, what I'm sayin'
I spend too much time explainin' myself
I hope there's some time to change it

I can taste it, my heart's breakin', please don't say it
That you know, when you know
I can't take it, I'm impatient, tell me baby
Now I know, you should go

I know I'll fall in love with you, baby
And that's not what I wanna do
I hope you won't ever lie to me
And if you do, I know I won't be your cry baby

I think I worry a lot
I need to take it easy
I got this anxious feeling
But it goes away for a minute
When I'm with you breathing

I can taste it, my heart's breakin', please don't say it
That you know, when you know
I can't take it, I'm impatient, tell me baby
Now I know, you should go

I know I'll fall in love with you, baby
And that's not what I wanna do
I hope you won't ever lie to me
And if you do, I know I won't be your cry baby

The Sun's coming out but I'm feeling colder
I can't wait 'til the drought is over

I know I'll fall in love with you, baby
And that's just what I'll do
I hope you won't ever lie to me
And if you do, I know I won't be your cry baby
I know I'll fall in love with you, baby
And that's not what I wanna do
I hope you won't ever lie to me
And if you do, I know I won't be your cry baby
Cry baby, cry baby
I need to cry, baby
Cry baby, cry baby
You need to cry, baby
Cry baby, cry baby
We need to cry
And if we do, I know that would be alright
