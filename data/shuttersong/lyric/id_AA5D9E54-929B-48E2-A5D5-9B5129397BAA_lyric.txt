All around the world this time of year
As a matter of fact it won't cost you nothing
It's in your heart you got it right there
You got it right there

The truth is
Your heart is the biggest gift you can give anyone
I know we can do it cause when I look around
There's enough for everyone

If you spend a little time
Look deep inside
Search your heart
And I'm sure you'll find that the
Best gift you could give this Christmas

All we need is love
Love is all we need
Love underneath the tree
Love is everything

All we need is love

Won't disappear
