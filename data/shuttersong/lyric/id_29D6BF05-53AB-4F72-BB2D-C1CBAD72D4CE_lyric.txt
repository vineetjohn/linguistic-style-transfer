Steady, are you ready?
Back to life, back to reality
Back to life, back to reality
 
Goin’ through a dark place, dark time
And I couldn’t even see the light (light)
Had my back up against the wall
I was feelin’ like do or die (die)
But what don’t kill me make me stronger
I know it’s gonna be alright (alright)
So we celebratin’ here tonight (tonight)
Yea we celebratin’ life tonight

Gotta make it count
So before we die
Let’s go all out

So till my time’s up up up up up
Bring me back 2 life, back 2 life

Every single one of y’all showed me 
So the love I’m givin’ back to y’all

From England, to Japan, to Jamaica
To right down to MIA

Here’s the king!
 
OK, them suckas tried to bury me
Jesus had to carry me
Middle finger to the reaper, nigga ain’t no scarin’ me
Apparently, you don’t understand who I am (who I am)
It’s trouble man, hundred grand in my pants
Whippin’ dropheads hardtops fit to sell Maybach’s
Maserati’s, Ferrari’s, that money I don’t play by
Presidents stop me, imagine if I stay down
Still shinin’ on them make them haters pull they shades out
When tragedy strikes, I struck back
Lookin’ for me to roll over and die
Who does that?
Left a nigga for dead, come back to life
I guess this is me ballin’ in the afterlife
Let’s get it
 
Back to life, back to reality
Back to life, back to reality
 
We gotta live it up up up up up
Champagne in my cup cup cup cup cup
DJ turn it up up up up up
Bring me back 2 life, back 2 life
Yea we gotta live it up up up up up
You know we don’t give a what what what what what
So till my time’s up up up up up
Bring me back 2 life, back 2 life
Back 2 life
