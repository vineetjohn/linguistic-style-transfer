More than just a dream...

Forty days and forty nights
I waited for a girl like you to come and save my life
All the days I waited for you
You know the ones who said I'd never find someone like you

And you were out of my league
All the things I believed
You were just the right kind
Yeah, you were more than just a dream
You were out of my league
Got my heartbeat racing
If I die don't wake me
Cause you are more than just a dream

From time to time I pinch myself
Because I think my girl mistakes me for somebody else
And every time she takes my hand
All the wonders that remain
Become a simple fact

That you were out of my league
All the things I believed
You were just the right kind
Yeah, you were more than just a dream
You were out of my league
Got my heartbeat racing
If I die don't wake me
Cause you are more than just a dream

You were out of my league
All the things I believed
You were just the right kind
Yeah, you were more than just a dream
You were out of my league
Got my heartbeat racing
If I die don't wake me
Cause you are more than just a dream

More than just a dream
More than just a dream
More than just a dream...
