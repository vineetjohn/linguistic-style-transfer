There's a place way down in Bed Stuy
Where a boy lives behind bricks
He's got an eye for girls of eighteen
And he turns them out like tricks
I went down to a place in Bed Stuy
A little liquor on my lips
I let him climb inside my body
And held him captive in my kiss
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting
I'm a wanderess
I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city
Don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah ha ah ah ah
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah ha ah ah ah
I'm a hurricane
I went down to a place in Brooklyn
Where you tripped on LSD
And I found myself reminded
To keep you far away from me
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting
I'm a wanderess
I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city
Don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah ha ah ah ah
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah ha ah ah ah
I'm a hurricane
He says, Oh, baby, beggin' you to save me.
Well lately, I like 'em crazy
Oh, maybe, you could devastate me
Little lady, come and fade me
I'm a wanderess
I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city
Don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
Come and fade me
Come and fade me
I'm a hurricane
