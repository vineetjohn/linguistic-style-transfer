Konvict, Konvict Muzik
And you know we up front

I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know, girl

Money in the air as Mo' fell
Grab you by your coattail, take you to the motel, ho sale
Don't tell, won't tell
Baby say, "I don't talk Dogg" but she told on me, oh well

Take a picture with me, what the flick gon' do
Baby, stick to me and I'ma stick on you
If you pick me, then I'ma pick on you
D O double G and I'm here to put this dick on you

I'm stuck on pussy and yours is right
Rip ridin' the poles and them doors is tight
And I'ma get me a shot for the end of the night
'Cuz pussy is pussy and baby, your pussy for life

I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know, girl

Shorty, I can see, you ain't lonely
Handful of niggaz and they all got cheese
So you lookin' at me now, what it's gon' be?
Just another tease far as I can see

I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know

Tryin' to get you up out this club
If it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwin' 'bout thirty stacks in the back
Make it rain like that 'cuz I'm far from a scrub

And you know my pedigree
Ex-dealer use to move 'phetamines
Girl, I spend money like it don't mean nothin'
And besides, I got a thing for you

I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know, girl

Mobbin' through the club in the low pressin'
I'm sittin' in the back in the smokers section
Bird's eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me but I can see you

It's cool, we jet, the mood is set, your pussy is wet
You rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck
Your body is movin', you're humpin' and jumpin'
Your titties is bouncin', you smilin'
And grinin' and lookin' at me

Girl and while you're lookin' at me
I'm ready to hit the Caddy right up on the patio
Move the patty to the Caddy
Baby, you got a fatty, the type I like to marry
Wantin' to just give you everything and that's kind of scary

'Cuz I'm lovin' the way you shake your ass
Bouncin', got me tippin' my glass
Lil' mully don't get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you

I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you (fuck you, fuck you...)
