"Don't Speak"

You and me 
We used to be together 
Everyday together always 
I really feel 
That I'm losing my best friend 
I can't believe
This could be the end 
It looks as though you're letting go 
And if it's real 
Well I don't want to know 

Don't speak 
I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining 
Don't tell me cause it hurts 
Don't speak 
I know what you're thinking 
I don't need your reasons 
Don't tell me cause it hurts

Our memories 
Well, they can be inviting 
But some are altogether 
Mighty frightening 
As we die, both you and I 
With my head in my hands 
I sit and cry 

Don't speak 
I know just what you're saying 
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me cause it hurts (no, no, no) 
Don't speak 
I know what you're thinking 
I don't need your reasons 
Don't tell me cause it hurts 

It's all ending 
I gotta stop pretending who we are... 
You and me I can see us dying...are we? 

Don't speak 
I know just what you're saying 
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me cause it hurts (no, no, no) 
Don't speak 
I know what you're thinking 
I don't need your reasons 
Don't tell me cause it hurts 
Don't tell me cause it hurts! 
I know what you're saying 
So please stop explaining

Don't speak,
don't speak, 
don't speak, 
oh I know what you're thinking 
And I don't need your reasons 
I know you're good, 
I know you're good, 
I know you're real good 
Oh, la la la la la la La la la la la la 
Don't, Don't, uh-huh Hush, hush darlin' 
Hush, hush darlin' Hush, hush 
don't tell me tell me cause it hurts 
Hush, hush darlin' Hush, hush darlin' 
Hush, hush don't tell me tell me cause it hurts
