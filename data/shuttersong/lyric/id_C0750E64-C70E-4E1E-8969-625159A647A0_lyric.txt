As we walk the golden mile
Down the pretty aisle
I know that you are mine
And there's nothin' in this world
That I know I wouldn't do
To be near you every day
Every hour, every minute

Take my hand
And let me lead the way

All through your life
I'll be by your side
Till death do us part
Baby, I'll be your friend
My love will never end
Till death do us part

When I wake up every day
With you lyin' in my arms
I wonder if I'm dreamin'
When I look into your eyes
I just can't believe it's true
That my heart belongs to you
Baby, we can have it all

Girl, take my hand
And let me lead the way

All through your life
I'll be by your side
Till death do us part
Baby, I'll be your friend
My love will never end
Till death do us part

There'll be good times
And there'll be bad
But I will stand beside you
Woman, all the way

And through the years
As life will put us through
When snow will fall on winter nights
I'll keep you warm inside
Yeah, baby, I will

All through your life
I'll be by your side
Till death do us part
Baby, I'll be your friend
My love will never end
Till death do us part

Yeah, baby, I'll be there
All through your life
I'll be by your side
Till death do us part

Baby, I'll be your friend
My love will never end
Till death do us part

Yeah, baby, I'll be there
Baby, I'll be there
All through your life
And I know that you'll be there
I know that you'll be there
Waiting for me
Yeah, baby, I'll be there
Baby, I'll be there
All through your life
And I know that you'll be there
I know that you'll be there
Waiting for me
