She's a spice, ride pipe like bike, like Yokohama
She heard the ting bend like banana
So she wanna give me the adunana-ne
She say I'm a sweeterman
But she say that she don't need a man
I say why don't we make an agreement then
We can just fuck while we're being friends
Girl I know you wanna

Cause the pussy too good, drink too strong

I need you right here beside me
If you oblige me, I'll hang it up, and I'll never
come out of retirement
You should just sleep on it, you shouldn't doubt
me
It would be different without me
What is it without me
Don't go do nothing without me
This is a blessing, mashallah, wallahi
I swear my life story's better than stories they
telling about me
They got it twisted
Ride the pipe like a bike, make sure you're going
the distance
And if he wasn't with it, then why were you with
him?
Maybe you just had to realize
That knowing the difference can make all the
difference
She wanna ride me that adanunana
Yeah she keep giving me looks
