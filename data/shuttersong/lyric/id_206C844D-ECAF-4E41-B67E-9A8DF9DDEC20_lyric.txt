Yeah, yo
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm and
Though the words sound steady, something's empty within'em
We say yeah with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
‘Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and fear
Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear

Waiting for the end to come, wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control
Flying at the speed of light thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It's hard to let you go

(Oh) I know what it takes to move on
(Oh) I know how it feels to lie
(Oh) All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

Sitting in an empty room trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last
I wish it wasn't so

(Oh) I know what it takes to move on
(Oh) I know how it feels to lie
(Oh) All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

Yo, yo
What was left when that fire was gone
I thought it felt right but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on
And I don't even know what kind of things I've said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead so
Picking up the pieces now where to begin
The hardest part of ending is starting again

All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
(I'm holding on to what I haven't got) But you listen through the tone and the violent
rhythm and
Though the words sound steady, something empty's within ‘em
We say yeah with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
(Holding on to what I haven't got) ‘Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain
and fear
Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear.
