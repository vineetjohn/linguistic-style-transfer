We The Best music!
Oh, this what we doin' here

I got them keys, keys, keys
I got them keys, keys, keys
I got them keys, keys, keys
I got them keys, keys, keys
We go to court, we gon' plead the fifth
I know the judge, I'ma shoot him some chips
I got them keys, keys, keys
I got them keys, keys, keys

Niggas always asking me the key
'Til you own your own you can't be free
'Til you're on your own you can't be me
How we still slaves in 2016?
Key to life, keep a bag comin'
Every night another bag comin'
I ain't been asleep since '96
I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
I been speedin' through life with no safety belt
One on one with the corner, with no safety help
I perform like Josh Norman, I ain't normal, nigga
Just a project nigga out in Beverly Hills, California, nigga
That Wraith talk, that's foreign, nigga
Special cloth talk here
All my niggas from the mud damn near
All my niggas millionares
We gon' take it there, I swear
You gon' think a nigga's psychic
You ain't seen nothin' like this
I should probably copyright this
I promise they ain't gonna like this

I got them keys, keys, keys
I got them keys, keys, keys
I got them keys, keys, keys
I got them keys, keys, keys
We go to court, we gon' plead the fifth
I know the judge, I'ma shoot him some chips
I got them keys, keys, keys
I got them keys, keys, keys
Radar, radar on, these niggas ain't even on my radar
Radar, radar on, on, you ain't on my radar
Radar, radar, no, no, you hatin' on my radar
No, no, you bitches ain't, bitches ain't even on my radar

I got a bag for lawyers, like, \
