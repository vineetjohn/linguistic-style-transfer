A-a-a-a-a-a-y
A-a-a-a-a-a-y
A-a-a-a-a-a-y
Ay, ay.

You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign

Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling in dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame it could burn out, it could burn out

Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes, and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

Lights flash, we will run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time, not this time

Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places

They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I, I know places we could hide
I know places, I know places
They take their shots, but we're bulletproof (I know places)
And you know for me, it's always you (I know places)
In the dead of night, your eyes so green (I know places)
And I know for you, it's always me
I know places.
