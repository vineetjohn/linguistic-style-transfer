Eighteen
Thousand year old soul
Midwest shooting star
In the day she waits
But she moonlights rock and roll
Playing the rain dance with her guitar

Sometimes you only get one chance
You gotta look in your eyes
I knew you in past life
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops
Ships pass in the night
I don't want to wait till the next life
One glance and the avalanche drops

One look and my heartbeat stops
Last call
And everybody's watching
The voice rings out like a storm
Sometimes the past
Echoes in the future

Started long before we were born
Sometimes you only get one chance
You gotta look in your eyes
I knew you in a past life
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops
Ships pass in the night
I don't want to wait till the next life
One glance and the avalanche drops

One look and my heartbeat stops
(Hey, don't wait)
Universe won't wait for you
(Hey, don't wait)
It's do or die, whatcha gon, gon, gonna choose
You gotta look in your eyes
I knew you in a past life
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops
You gotta look in your eyes
I knew you in a past life
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops
Ships pass in the night

I don't want to wait till the next life
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops
