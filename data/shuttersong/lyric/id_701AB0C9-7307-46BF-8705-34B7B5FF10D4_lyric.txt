You give me something to talk about
Something to talk about, hey!
I know it's chemicals that make me cling to you, cling to you
And I need a miracle to get away from you, away from you

I know it's chemicals
I need a miracle
And I'm not spiritual
But please stay

‘Cause I think you're a saint and I think you're an angel.
I said ohh
You give me something to talk about, something to talk about.
I said ohh
You give me something to think about that's not the shit in my head.
You're a miracle.
You're a miracle.
A miracle.

Transparent hands were at my neck, at my neck, at my
But I love the way you let me breathe instead, breathe instead
Take in your chemicals
You are a miracle
And I'm not spiritual
But please stay

‘Cause you're a glimpse of bliss, a little taste of heaven.
I said ohh
You give me something to talk about, something to talk about.

I said ohh
You give me something to think about that's not the shit in my head.
You're a miracle.
You're a miracle.

A miracle.
I said ohh
You give me something to talk about, something to talk about.
I said ohh
You give me something to think about that's not the shit in my head.
I need a miracle to bring me back to you, back to you
I know you're gone now but I still wait for you
Wait for you

hey, hey
I said ohh
You give me something to talk about, something to talk about.
I said ohh
You give me something to think about that's not the shit in my head.
You're a miracle
You're a miracle
A miracle
I still wait, I still wait for you
I know you're gone now but I still wait for you, wait for you.
