All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray.
I've been for a walk on a winter's day.
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A.
California dreamin' on such a winter's day.

All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray.
I've been for a walk on a winter's day.
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A.
California dreamin' on such a winter's day.

Stopped in to a church I passed along the way.
Well I got down on my knees and I pretend to pray.
You know the preacher liked the cold
He knows I'm gonna stay.
California dreamin' on such a winter's day.

(I'd be safe and warm) (I'd be safe and warm)

All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray.
I've been for a walk on a winter's day.
If I didn't tell her I could leave today,
California dreamin' on such a winter's day.
On such a winter's day.
On such a winter's day.
