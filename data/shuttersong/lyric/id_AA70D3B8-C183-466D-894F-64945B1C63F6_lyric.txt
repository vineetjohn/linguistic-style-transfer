I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time
And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
So you were never a saint
And I love in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild
And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same
This is the state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles' heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real
And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same
And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same
This is the state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
