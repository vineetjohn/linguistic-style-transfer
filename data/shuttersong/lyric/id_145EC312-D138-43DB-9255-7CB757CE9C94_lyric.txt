Well I grew up in a real town
Where the prom queen had a plastic crown
And we really did just drive around
‘Cause there wasn't sh to do
We didn't know we were real broke
Daddy rolled them real smokes
We drank RC, no real Coke
But our neighbor had a pool
We got green grass and two trees
Whoa oh oh oh oh
But it ain't like what's on TV
Whoa oh oh oh oh

This is real life in the real world
We ain't talking to no models
We got real girls
We get real low, we get real high
It ain't all good baby but it's all right
Real life

We got a dive bar
With a real band, they play too loud
And they're real bad
But we're real boys so we still dance
And we stay out way too late
Hit the Waffle House for some real food
But that waitress, she's real rude
She got real problems but we do too so we tip her anyway
That's just the way that it is
Whoa oh oh oh oh
That's just the way that we live
Whoa oh oh oh oh

This is real life in the real world
We ain't talking to no models
We got real girls
We get real low, we get real high
It ain't all good baby but it's all right
Real life
Yeah we're livin' real life

We find real love, get real hurt
Fall real hard, shake off the dirt
Pray to God, let's make a deal
I guess it just got real

We get real low, we get real high
It ain't all good baby but it's all right
Real life
This ain't no fairy tale, it's real life
