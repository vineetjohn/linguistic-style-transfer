I give... Give, give
Tell me why I act this way
Tell me that I'll change someday
I'll be the one that can satisfy you

If I can't rectify the...
I give... Give, give
...Few things that I've got to change and a few things in my way
Okay, so I've said it before and won't imply that

You're not too close to the fact
Just nod your head and get up
I'm not going let you give up, babe
Just nod your head and get up
I'm not going let you give up, babe
I know that sometimes you wished I'd go away, away
Just nod your head and get up

I'm not going let you give up, babe
Don't we get another chance?
Did I make the final stand above the ones that are oh so perfect
'Cause they know how to work it, work it, work it?

I give... Give, give
Looking like I'll keep it now, I made the cut
Okay, so I've done it before and you think it's an act
But I call this time a wrap

Just nod your head and get up
I'm not going let you give up, babe
Just nod your head and get up
I'm not going let you give up, babe
I know that sometimes you wished I'd go away, away
I know that sometimes you wished I'd go away, away
But I'd wished that you would know that I'm here to stay, to stay
Just nod your head and get up
I'm not going let you give up, babe

Tell me what I got to do
Oh no, don't give up
I'll do everything to make it better, babe
I'll do anything
Bite, I'll bite
Do you like it like that? (Do you like it like that?)

Tell me what I've got to do
Oh no, don't give up
'Cause I'll do anything to make you see me, baby
(Give me your attention)
Bite, I'll make you better
I know that sometimes you wished I'd go away, away
I know that sometimes you wished I'd go away, away
But I'd wished that you would know that I'm here to stay, to stay
Just nod your head and get up
I'm not going let you give up, babe
Just nod your head and get up
I'm not going let you give up
I give...
