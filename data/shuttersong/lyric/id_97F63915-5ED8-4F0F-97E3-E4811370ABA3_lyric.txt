Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I stare at you
Why can't I keep you safe as my own?
One moment I have you the next you are gone
Rehearsed steps on an empty stage
That boy's got my heart in a silver cage
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I crave you

I walked into the room dripping in gold
Yeah dripping in gold
I walked into the room dripping in gold
Dripping in gold
A wave of heads did turn, or so I've been told
Or so I've been told
My heart broke when I saw you kept your gaze controlled

Oh I cannot solve

Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I stare at you
Why can't I keep you safe as my own?
One moment I have you the next you are gone
Rehearsed steps on an empty stage
That boy's got my heart in a silver cage

Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I crave you

It's true I crave you
Crave you
It's true I crave you

It's true I crave you
Crave you

It's true I crave you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Crave you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Crave you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Let's just stop and think, before I lose faith
Surely I can't fall into a game of chase
Around his little finger, that boy has got me curled
I try to reach out but he's in his own world
This boy's got my head tied in knots with all his games

I simply want him more because he looks the other way
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I stare at you
Why can't I keep you safe as my own?
One moment I have you the next you are gone
Rehearsed steps on an empty stage
That boy's got my heart in a silver cage
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I crave you
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I stare at you
Why can't I keep you safe as my own?
One moment I have you the next you are gone
Rehearsed steps on an empty stage
That boy's got my heart in a silver cage
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I crave you
I am craving you
I am craving you
I am craving you
I am craving you
I am craving you
I am craving you
