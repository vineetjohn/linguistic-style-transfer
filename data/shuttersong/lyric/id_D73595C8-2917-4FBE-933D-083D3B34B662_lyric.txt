You are not your makeup,
Not your clothes,
An anonymous face.
No one knows,
You're not a skin color,
A pretty face,
The number of inches around your waist.
There's so much you've been through,
That nobody knows,
So many things you never show.

You're more than labels,
More than pain,
Baby you're more than your mistakes.
And you got something, to say.

Ohhhhhhh woahhhhhh

When will you realize, baby you're worth it,
Don't have to do anything to earn it.
Baby you're perfect,
You deserve it,
When will you see what I see,
And realize you're worth it.

You are not a burden,
Not a waste,
You're not a copy,
Can't be replaced.
You're not your pain,
Not your past,
Scars will never hold you back.
There's so much you've been through that nobody knows,
So many things you never show.

You're more than labels,
More than pain,
Baby you're more than your mistakes.
And you got something, to say.
Ohhhhhhh woahhhhhh

When will you realize, baby you're worth it,
Don't have to do anything to earn it.
Baby you're perfect,
You deserve it,
When will you see what I see,
And realize you're worth it.

You're worth it, baby you're worth it.
You're worth it, baby you're worth it.
You're worth it, baby you're worth it.
You're worth it, baby you're worth it.
You're worth it, baby you're worth it.
You're worth it, baby you're worth it.
You're worth it, baby you're worth it.
You're worth it.

You're more than labels,
More than pain,
Baby you're more than your mistakes.
And you got something, to say.
Ohhhhhhh woahhhhhh

When will you realize, baby you're worth it,
Don't have to do anything to earn it.
Baby you're perfect,
You deserve it,
When will you see what I see,
And realize you're worth it.

You're worth it, baby you're worth it.
You're worth it, baby you're worth it.
You're worth it, baby you're worth it.
You're worth it, baby you're worth it.
You're worth it, baby you're worth it.
You're worth it, baby you're worth it.
You're worth it, baby you're worth it.
You're worth it.
