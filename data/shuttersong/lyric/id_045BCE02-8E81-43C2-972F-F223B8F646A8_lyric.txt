[Verse 1 - Beyonce:]
I been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind, oh
Now I'm even more lost
You're still so fine
All mine...
All mine...
Been having conversations about break-ups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oh

Cause if we are
We're taking this a little too far...
If we are...
We're taking this a little too far...
Baby if we are...
We're taking this a little too far...

With me being where ever I'm at
Worrying about where ever you are
We're taking this a little too...
Far...
We're taking this a little too...
Far...
We're taking this a little too...
Far...

[Hook 1 - Drake:]
Know you wanna roll with a good girl
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time...
This is a song for the good girl
Don't sleep when you know you got a good girl
One time...
This is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll wanna roll with a good girl
One time...
This is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
What's up

[Verse 2 - Beyonce:]
On my mind, I pass my bed time
No rest at the kingdom...
Alone in my place, my heart is away
All that I can think of is...
We should get married, we should get married
Let's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away

[Pre-Hook:]
Stop making a big deal out of the little things,
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
I got everything I'm asking for but you...
Stop making a big deal out of the little things,
Let's get carried away...
Come right now you know where I stay...

[Hook 2 - Drake & Beyoncé:]
I just wanna say your mine, your mine
I just wanna say your mine, your mine
Fuck what they heard your mine, your mine
All I'm really asking for is you...
Your mine, your mine
I just wanna say your mine, your mine
Fuck what they heard your mine, your mine
Long as you know who you belong to...

[Verse 3 - Drake:]
Oh... from 8 until late I think bout you
You're on my nights I don't know what to do
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep
This whole thing got way to deep and we should
