Hello hello Mr. Fighter
Look! there we go again...
Go-getters don't forsake!
They never wallow in their fate.
More than a thousand miles until the end
We're never gonna know what lies ahead.
We only got today
to learn from our yesterday!
I feel alive (bringing into play)
my whole life (going all the way)
I'm still alive (and I turn away)
from broken mirrors.
I feel alive (when I dare to say)
I wanna fight
Won't fix by running, running, running...
SAY YAY YAY YAY!
Come on and raise your battle cry
You are the one who never dies!
Hurray sing it lalalala! Go on singing lalalala!
You keep on climbing over hills...
Right now you're following your dreams!
Hurray sing it lalalala! Hurray!
SAY YAY YAY YAY!
Hurray!
SAY YAY YAY YAY!
SAY YAY YAY YAY!
Hurray!
SAY YAY YAY YAY!
Hello Hello Mr. Danger
No need to be afraid!
I know by heart my shades
I got the light between my breaks...
More than a thousand wounds upon my hands
of every time I fought them face to face!
We go through our mistakes
to find the way to go back straight.
I feel alive (bringing into play)
my whole life (going all the way)
I'm still alive (and I turn away)
from broken mirrors.
I feel alive (when I dare to say)
I wanna fight
Won't fix by running... No, no, no, no, won't fix by running!
Come on and raise your battle cry
You are the one who never dies!
Hurray sing it lalalala! Go on singing lalalala!
You keep on climbing over hills...
Right now you're following your dreams!
Hurray sing it lalalala! Hurray!
