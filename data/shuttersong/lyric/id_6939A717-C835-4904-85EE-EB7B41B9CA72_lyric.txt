Got the club goin' up
On a Tuesday

Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up
On a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up
On a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up
On a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Squad goin' up
Nobody flippin' packs now
I just did 3 in a row
Them shows is back-to-back to back now

Put the world on our sound
You know PARTY and The Weeknd
Ain't got no motherfuckin' time
To party on the weekend
Tell Gelo, bring the juice
We about to get lit
Fill the room up with some tings
One night off and this is it
Always workin' OT,
Overtime and out of town

Shit is crazy back home
It kills me that I'm not around
I think we gettin' too deep
Shit I'm talkin' might be too true
Upstairs I got xan's in a Advil
Bottle, I don't take them shits, but you do
So I got 'em for you
I don't need the pills
I'm just gonna' have another drink
And when I'm puttin' work in on a weekend
I'll look back on this and think
How we had the club going up
On a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up
On a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up
On a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up
On a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Workin' Monday night
On the corner flippin' hard
Made at least 3 thousand
On the boulevard
I've been workin' graveyard
Shifts every other weekend
Ain't got fuckin' time
To party on the weekend
I've been flippin' in the house
Makin' juugs on the highway
I've been ridin' out of state
Makin' money like my way
I don't think that I should dance
I'm just gon' have another drink
I'm doin' my stance
You know my molly prant
I got the loudest of the loud
You know my gas stink
My P.O. Think I'm in the house
Don't give a damn 'bout what she think
Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up
On a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up
On a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up
On a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
And I know I know how I made it on my own
I made my own style, I don't think that I should stay
You know I gotta' go
You're moving too fast
Don't wanna take it slow
Got the club goin' up
On a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up
On a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up
On a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up
On a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up
On a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up
On a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Got the club goin' up
