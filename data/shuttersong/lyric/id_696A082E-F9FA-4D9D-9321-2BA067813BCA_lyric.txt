Do you ever feel like breaking down
Do you ever feel out of place
Like somehow you just don't belong
And no one understands you

Do you ever wanna run away
Do you lock yourself in your room
With the radio on, turned up so loud
That no one hears you screaming

No you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels allright
No you don't know what it's like
To be like me

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked
When you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life

Do you wanna be somebody else
Are you sick of being so left out
Are you desperate to find something more
Before your life is over

Are you stuck inside a world you hate
Are you sick of everyone around
With their big, fake smiles and stupid lies
While deep inside you're bleeding

No you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels allright
No you don't know what it's like
To be like me

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked
When you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life

No one ever lied straight to your face
And no one ever stabbed you in the back
You might think I'm happy
But I'm not gonna be okay

Everybody always get you what you wanted
Never had to work, it was alway there
You don't know what it's like
What it's like

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked
When you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No you don't know what it's like (What it's like)

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked
When you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life
Welcome to my life
Welcome to my life
