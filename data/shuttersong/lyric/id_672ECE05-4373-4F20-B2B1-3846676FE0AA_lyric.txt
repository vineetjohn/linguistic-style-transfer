Get back to your seat
Get back mashin' teeth
Oh, I want all of your mind

People turn the TV on it looks just like a window, yeah
People turn the TV on it looks just like a window, yeah

Digital witnesses, what's the point of even sleeping?
If I can't show it, you can't see me
What's the point of doing anything?

(This is no time for confessing)
Mm, I want all of your mind

People turn the TV on it looks just like a window, yeah
People turn the TV on it looks just like a window, yeah

Digital witnesses, what's the point of even sleeping?
If I can't show it, you can't see me
Watch me jump right off the London Bridge

(This is no time for confessing)

People turn the TV on and throw it out the window, yeah
Get back to your stare
I care, but I don't care

Oh, oh, I, I want all of your mind
Give me all of your mind
I want all of your mind
Give me all of it
Digital witnesses, what's the point of even sleeping?
If I can't show it, if you can't see me
What's the point of doing anything?
What's the point of even sleeping?
So, I stop sleeping, yeah, I stop sleeping
Won't somebody sell me back to me?
