Mustard on the beat, ho!
Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl, I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fuck it like no other
Don't you tell 'em what we do
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even
You ain't even gotta tell 'em
Don't you tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even
Don't you tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even
You ain't even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
Know you say you down with it
Won't tell 'em how you hit the ground with it
Girl, you know I'm from Chicago
I act a fool Bobby Brown with it
In it, nobody take me out though
You got gifts bring 'em down to the south pole
Marathon doll gon' puttin' miles
Don't you worry 'bout it might gon' work it out
Only it's you got me feeling like this
Oh why, why, why, why
Loving while grabbing the rhythm of your hips
That's right, right, right, right, right
Dely full, full with it
But you know I know what to do with it
I get it at, girl, I'm talking laps
As if you got to pull with it
And since she ain't with your best friend
Then let me be your diamond
You know you feeling how your boy press play
Just keep that ass re-winding
Only it's you got me feeling like this
Ooh why, why, why, why, why
Loving while grabbing the rhythm your hips
That's right, right, right, right, right
Throw it up 9-3-4, 8-6-1-6
I gotta missed call from your bitch
She been plotting on me for a cool minute
She wanna' suck my dick, and I'm cool with it
I like her in the shower, when it's wet and fresh
On my late-night thirsty, 'cause it was late-night and I was thirsty
Girl, I been to that county girl, I ain't telling
Handcuff me to the bed, girl, it ain't no bailing
I keep a stack of hundreds like I keep a secret
If anything you were just exploring, you wasn't cheating
She got my number stored under fake names
Her nigga think she faithful, but she running game
YOLO, so take me out these Polos
And we can fuck from Uno to Ocho
Only it's you got me feeling like this
Oh why, why, why, why
Loving while grabbing the rhythm of your hips
That's right, right, right, right, right
