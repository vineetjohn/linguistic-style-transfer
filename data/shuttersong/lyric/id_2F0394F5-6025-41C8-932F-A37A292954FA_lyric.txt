There's no way to say this song's about someone
Every time you're not in my arms I start to lose myself
Someone please pass me my shades don't let em see me down
You have taken over my days
So tonight I'm going out
Yea I feel like there is no better place
When I'm by your side
I have a little taste and I'll hold this for you
at the party anyway
'Cause all the girls are looking fine
But you're the only one on my mind
La da dee La la da doo
La la da me La la da you
La da dee La la da doo
There's only me There's only you
La da dee La la da doo
La la da me La la da you
La da dee La la da doo
When you are gone I'll think of you
All these places packed with people
But your face is all I see
And the music's way to loud
But your voice won't let me be
So many pretty girls around
They're just dressing to impress
But the thought of you alone has got me sweating
I don't know what to see next
Yea I feel like there is no better place
When I'm by your side
I have a little taste and I'll hold this for you
At the party anyway
'Cause all the girls are looking fine
But you're the only one on my mind
La da dee La la da doo
La la da me La la da you
La da dee La la da doo
There's only me There's only you
La da dee La la da doo
La la da me La la da you
La da dee La la da doo
When you are gone I'll think of you
La da dee La la da doo
La la da me La la da you
La da dee La la da doo
There's only me There's only you
La da dee La la da doo
La la da me La la da you
La da dee La la da doo
When you are gone I'll think of you
I'll pretend the night is so beautiful
Take a photo with the pose
La da dee La la da doo
They won't see through my disguise
Right here behind my eyes
Replaying in my mind
La da da yea
Yea I feel like there is no better place
When I'm by your side
I have a little taste and I'll hold this for you
At the party anyway
'Cause all the girls are looking fine
But you're the only one on my mind
La da dee La la da doo
La la da me La la da you
La da dee La la da doo
There's only me There's only you
La da dee La la da doo
La la da me La la da you
La da dee La la da doo
When you are gone I'll think of you
La da dee La la da doo
La la da me La la da you
La da dee La la da doo
There's only me There's only you
La da dee La la da doo
La la da me La la da you
La da dee La la da doo
When you are gone I'll think of you
