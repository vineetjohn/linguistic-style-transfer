It's Myx Moscato
It's friends in the bottle
It's Nicki full throttle
It's all, all
Swimming in the grotto
We winning in the lotto
We dipping in the pot of blue pho-to
Kidding so good
This drippin' on wood
Get a ride in the engine that could go
Batman Robin it bang, bang, cocking it
Queen Nicki dominate, prominate
It's me, Jessie, and Ari
If they test me they sorry
Riders umph like Harley
Then pull off in this Ferrari
If he hangin' we bangin'
Phone rangin', he slangin'
It ain't karaoke night but get the mic 'cause I'm singing (uh)

B to da' A to da' N to da' G to da' uh (baby)
B to da' A to da' N to da' G to da' hey
See anybody could be good to you
You need a bad girl to blow your mind (your mind)

Bang bang into the room (I know ya want it)
Bang bang all over you (I'll let ya have it)
Wait a minute lemme take you there (ah)
Wait a minute till ya (ah)
Bang bang there goes your heart (I know ya want it)
Back, back seat of my car (I'll let ya have it)
Wait a minute lemme take you there (ah)
Wait a minute till ya (ah)
Bang bang into the room (I know ya want it)
Bang bang all over you (I'll let ya have it)
Yo, I said bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Bang bang there goes your heart (I know ya want it)
Back, back seat of my car (I'll let ya have it)
Wait a minute lemme take you there (ah)
Wait a minute till ya (ah)
