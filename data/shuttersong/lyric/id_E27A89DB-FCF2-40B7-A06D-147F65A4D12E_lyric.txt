The Christmas Song - Nat King Cole
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
We'll find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to many two
Although It's been said
Many times  many ways
Merry Christmas to you
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to many two
Although It's been said
Many times  many ways
Merry Christmas to you
