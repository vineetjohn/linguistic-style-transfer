So at my show on Monday
I was hoping someday
You'd be on your way to better things

It's not about your make-up
Or how you try to shape up
To these tiresome paper dreams
Paper dreams, honey

So now you pour your heart out
You're telling me you're far out
Not about to lie down for your cause

But you don't pull my strings
'Cause I'm a better man
Moving on to better things

But uh oh, I love her because
She moves in her own way
But uh oh, she came to my show
Just to hear about my day

And at the show on Tuesday
She was in her mindset
Tempered furs and spangled boots

Looks are deceiving, making me believe it
And these tiresome paper dreams
Paper dreams, honey, yeah

So won't you go far
Tell me you're a keeper
Not about to lie down for your cause

But you don't pull my strings because
'Cause I'm a better man
Moving on to better things

But uh oh, I love her because
She moves in her own way
But uh oh, she came to my show
Just to hear about my day

Yes, our wish's that we never make it
Through all the summers
We kept them up instead of
Kicking us back down to the suburbs
