I miss the taste of the sweet life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh baby why did you run away?

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you'd have my back
So I wonder where were you
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
And nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following
“
The map that leads to you
— Maroon 5

I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
Cause all the strangers come over me
Now I can't get over you
No, I just can't get over you

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you'd have my back
So I wonder where were you
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
And nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you'd have my back
So I wonder where were you
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
And nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
