there's only so much anyone can do with a florid , overplotted , anne rice rock 'n' roll vampire novel before the built-in silliness of the whole affair defeats them .
it's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism .

apart from dazzling cinematography , we have seen just about everything in blue crush in one form or the other .
too much of the humor falls flat .
detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor .
van wilder does not bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like tomcats , freddy got fingered , and slackers .
the piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones .
very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality ca not hide the giant achilles' heel in " stuart little number " : there's just no story , folks .
the plot combines the blues brothers and almost famous ( but with bears , and a g rating ) , with an excruciating dollop of disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure .
no way i can believe this load of junk .
" roger michell ( " notting hill " ) directs a morality thriller . "
it's dumb , but more importantly , it's just not scary .
there is no pleasure in watching a child suffer . just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame .
the movie's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach . but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ?
even with a green mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting . and that leaves a hole in the center of the salton sea .
there's just no currency in deriding james bond for being a clichéd , doddering , misogynistic boy's club .
when the film ended , i felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while .
full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny
the film's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style .
the iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did .
it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for number minutes .
this movie is maddening . it conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought .
should have been someone else-
the film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner .

velocity represents everything wrong with ''independent film'' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the american filmmaking scene .
just one bad idea after another .
because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , 'swimfan' left me with a very bad feeling .
though moonlight mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama .
a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle .
i ca not recommend it . but it's surprisingly harmless .
corpus collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about number minutes in .
the last number minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we have seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes
it's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and shiner , starring michael caine as an aging british boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that .
a by-the-numbers effort that wo not do much to enhance the franchise .
involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters .
overall the film feels like a low-budget tv pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube .
it's of the quality of a lesser harrison ford movie - six days , seven nights , maybe , or that dreadful sabrina remake .
it appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen .
despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults .
shrewd but pointless .
an unclassifiably awful study in self- and audience-abuse .
sluggish , tonally uneven .
this movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work .
hey arnold ! the movie could have been made number years ago , and parents' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing .
this one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics .
excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters .
once the number year old benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back .
a working class " us vs . them " opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered .
if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of 'there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .
there are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part sliding doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them .
it takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of robert forster , anne meara , eugene levy , and reginald veljohnson all in the same movie .
we have not seen such hilarity since say it is not so !
expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery .
the cold turkey would have been a far better title .
the idea of number-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough . the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque .
the ga-zillionth airhead movie about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate measures .
zaidan's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight .

just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time .
a valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the nba .

so much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie .
the experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not .
the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power .
it has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death .
almost gags on its own gore .
how do you spell cliché ?
it's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show .
the moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess's home video of their baby's birth .
while hill has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film .
in the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a résumé loaded with credits like " girl in bar #number . "
too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped .
under number ? a giggle a minute . over age number ? big fat waste of time .
hey arnold ! the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to number times their natural size , and it ai not pretty .
sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest .
this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience .

i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers .
while much of the cast has charm -- especially allodi and nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy .
this directorial debut from music video show-off higuchinsky is all flash .
yes , ballistic is silly . unfortunately , it's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies .
the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows .
the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it's actually pretty good in the first few minutes .
while it's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( sugar hill gang , etc . ) , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences .
not only unfunny , but downright repellent .
care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters .
forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending .
does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in- the-blanks with a tragic past .
k-number exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap hollywood tension .

the entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad .
the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience's chain .
confirms the nagging suspicion that ethan hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it .
made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss .
it's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center .
holden caulfield did it better .
a synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness .
oh come on . like you could not smell this turkey rotting from miles away .
if it's seldom boring , well , it's also rarely coherent .
simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy .
not exactly the bees knees
it does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they are being streamed over a numberk modem .
the kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated .
makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment . . . but at least this time there's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff .
the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment .
jacquot's rendering of puccini's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera . in his first stab at the form , jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically .
chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama .

one of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year .
a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that's pretty toxic in its own right .
too slow , too long and too little happens .
the film's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency . it's just filler .
sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance .
utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , roberto benigni's pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film .
a hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the mason-dixon line .
scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence . it's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job .
they takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending .
barely gets off the ground .
even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , miller's hand often feels unsure .
pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his co-director , tony r . abrams , in their feature debut .
at its best , queen is campy fun like the vincent price horror classics of the 'numbers . at its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects .
from the opening scenes , it's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie .
it takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as 'worse than expected , ' but ghost ship somehow manages to do exactly that .
on the bright side , it contains jesse ventura's best work since the xfl .
despite impeccable acting . . . and a script that takes some rather unexpected ( even , at times , preposterous ) turns , love is just too , too precious in the end .
a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments ( including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether ) .

i would have to say the star and director are the big problems here .
without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace .
it's like every bad idea that's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs' slickness and sophistication ( and who knew they even had any ? ) .
while the resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these .

to my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation .
what the director can&#number ; t do is make either of val kilmer&#number ; s two personas interesting or worth caring about .
in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy .

not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions .
a science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left .
once kim begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors , you may decide it's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard .
the words , 'frankly , my dear , i do not give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate .
what's next : " my mother the car ? "
all the amped-up tony hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal ca not disguise the fact that , really , we have been here , done that .
a sequel that's much too big for its britches .

there's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like lavinia , to go the conservative route .
it's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions .
the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious .
but the power of these subjects is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film's narrative .
rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment .

harrison's flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all .
this re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against .
a string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity .
the movie is dawn of the dead crossed with john carpenter's ghosts of mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second .
basically a static series of semi-improvised ( and semi-coherent ) raps between the stars .
too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging . . . the isle defies an easy categorization .
an unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer/director john mckay can swallow .

" the time machine " is a movie that has no interest in itself . it does not believe in itself , it has no sense of humorit's just plain bored .
. . . a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it .

it's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong .
although there are several truly jolting scares , there's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at .
i will bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film .
star trek : nemesis meekly goes where nearly every star trek movie has gone before . wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by silly putty and kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test trekkie loyalty .
like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all .
i do not mind having my heartstrings pulled , but do not treat me like a fool .
. . . although this idea is " new " the results are tired .
i am guessing the director is a magician . after all , he took three minutes of dialogue , number seconds of plot and turned them into a number-minute movie that feels five hours long .

do not be fooled by the impressive cast list - eye see you is pure junk .
not since freddy got fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through .
the documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation .
plays like a volatile and overlong w magazine fashion spread .
a better title , for all concerned , might be swept under the rug .
this movie seems to have been written using mad-libs . there can be no other explanation . hilariously inept and ridiculous .
vera's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them .
a shapeless blob of desperate entertainment .

a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going .
stealing harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time .
pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery . for this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- chelsea walls deserves a medal .

it's a grab bag of genres that do not add up to a whole lot of sense .
movie fans , get ready to take off . . . the other direction .
director o'fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short .
the intent is almost exactly the same as the full monty . all that's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight .
no one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through the master of disguise .
even the finest chef ca not make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro ca not make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy .
there's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging .
it's not without its pleasures , but i will stick with the tune .
miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness .
despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine .
more maudlin than sharp .
this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic .
it's slow -- very , very slow . it's not the ultimate depression-era gangster movie . that's pure pr hype .
characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license avary employs .
comes . . . uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of the bicycle thief .
visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide treasure planet entirely and completely reimagine it .
stealing harvard is evidence that the farrelly bros . -- peter and bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with green's half-hearted movie career .
there seems to be no clear path as to where the story's going , or how long it's going to take to get there .

i do not think i laughed out loud once . and when you are talking about a slapstick comedy , that's a pretty big problem .
it's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just ca not get no satisfaction .
slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $number to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ?
. . . turns so unforgivably trite in its last number minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock .
the notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy .
my reaction in a word : disappointment . his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it .
it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others .
sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is rebecca romijn-stamos .
intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story's least interesting subject .
a non-mystery mystery .
feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot .
what an embarrassment .
for each chuckle there are at least number complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout .
in its own way , joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis buñuel film without the latter's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius .
i have always dreamed of attending cannes , but after seeing this film , it's not that big a deal .
the vintage is pure 'number , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = do not have an affair with a nutjob ; unfaithful = do not if you are married to one .
a workshop mentality prevails .
it cannot be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull . yes , dull .

it's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes .
as a rumor of angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even ms . redgrave's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality .
new best friend's playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous .
an appalling 'ace ventura' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak , former wrestler chyna and dolly parton . if any of them list this 'credit' on their resumes in the future , that will be much funnier than anything in the film . . .
the humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant .
scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; perdition , meanwhile , reads more like driving miss daisy than goodfellas .
while the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target .
as the latest bid in the tv-to-movie franchise game , i spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor .
this is not even madonna's swept away . this is her blue lagoon .
the director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom .

burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast .
an overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce .
has all the depth of a wading pool .
this is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing .
the so-inept- it's-surreal dubbing ( featuring the voices of glenn close , regis philbin and breckin meyer ) brings back memories of cheesy old godzilla flicks .
. . . the movie is just a plain old monster .
if this disposable tissue has one wild card , it's john turturro , who's simply fab as a spanish butler with a foot fetish .
one long string of cliches .
a noble failure .
fancy a real downer ? leigh lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race .
professionally speaking , it's tempting to jump ship in january to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller .
nelson's brutally unsentimental approach . . . sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle .
weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger . but its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell .
at once half-baked and overheated .
there's a solid woman- finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you would have to dig pretty deep to uncover it .
i still ca not relate to stuart : he's a mouse , for cryin' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough .
serry wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition . it's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one .
by the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk , . . . actually pretty good . of course , by more objective measurements it's still quite bad .

all this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull .
demme's loose approach kills the suspense .
this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture .

the film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low .
nothing more than a mediocre trifle .
a turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull .
too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , david arquette .
if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he would have them mate .
trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere .
it would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun .
theology aside , why put someone who ultimately does not learn at the center of a kids' story ?
all that ( powerpuff girls ) charm is present in the movie , but it's spread too thin .
sometimes smart but more often sophomoric .
the ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch .
collateral damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-number/number , an antique , in the end . as are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness .
dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it does not even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding .
its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing .
a great idea becomes a not-great movie .
. . . watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life . and if the hours wins 'best picture' i just might .
by the end , i was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious .
not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it's almost funny .
feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention .
life is a crock -- or something like it .
made by jackasses for jackasses .
despite a powerful portrayal by binoche , it's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum .
the picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn .
bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that .
disjointed parody .
given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there is not much .
a bravura exercise in emptiness .
philip k . dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach .
despite the premise of a good story . . . it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles .
all prints of this film should be sent to and buried on pluto .
not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well .
first good , then bothersome . excellent acting and direction .
this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
it's difficult to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing--i am prepared to call it a draw .
even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame .
so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program .
sunshine state lacks the kind of dynamic that limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece .
even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles . . . so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential .
a long-winded , predictable scenario .
too close to phantom menace for comfort .
. . . silly humbuggery . . .
although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result does not fully satisfy either the die-hard jason fans or those who can take a good joke .
too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining .
this movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray .
it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original .
melanie eventually slugs the yankee . too bad the former murphy brown does not pop reese back .
at the bottom rung of the series' entries .
a real clunker . a well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless .
a dreary rip-off of goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for hispanic americans .
the picture , scored by a perversely cheerful marcus miller accordion/harmonica/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety .
good for a few unintentional laughs , " extreme ops " was obviously made for the " xxx " crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction .
a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason .
a frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality .
lawrence preaches strictly to the converted .
as written by michael berg and michael j . wilson from a story by wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all .
will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible qatsi siblings .
just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos .
choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy .
. . . the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs .
the only thing in pauline and paulette that you have not seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers .

the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven .
there's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about .
too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes .
when a film is created solely because it's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result . let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested .
unfortunately , heartbreak hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit .
the more kevin costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like dragonfly tossed at them .
it's difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of american chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view .
the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon numberever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace .
taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore . but as a movie , it's a humorless , disjointed mess .
if myers decides to make another austin powers movie , maybe he should just stick with austin and dr evil .
the backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense .
too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless .
overly stylized with lots of flash black-&-white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , ( it's ) at its worst when it's actually inside the ring .
what is captured during the conceptual process does not add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , the selection , became in its final form .

any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment .
the director's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship ( most notably wretched sound design ) .
about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through .

flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey .
a chaotic panorama that's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags .
suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video .
the screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable .
a trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience .
newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept  a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .
should not have been allowed to use the word " new " in its title , because there's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie .
often silly  and gross  but it's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films .
the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap .
it's exactly what you would expect .
the performances are so leaden , michael rymer's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud .
a subtle variation on i spit on your grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men .
reggio's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad .
as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne tv sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up .
if somebody was bored and . . . decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus' son , they would come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler .
the best you can say about it is it's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now .
a tough go , but leigh's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined and despairing milieu .
an overstuffed compendium of teen-catholic-movie dogma .
too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing .
ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ?
eh .
the movie's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension .
the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge . these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future .
if this is the resurrection of the halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead .
this formulaic chiller will do little to boost stallone's career .

the average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town america .
no worse than a lot of the crap we have been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black number as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go .
the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset .
at first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin .
never again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds .
the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : they might be giants' so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed .
este é apenas mais um ( longo ) episódio do programa da mtv . a única diferença é que , desta vez , a paramount teve o mau gosto de exibi-lo nos cinemas .
technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial .
the title's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is .
the parts are better than the whole ( bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in new york ) .
while the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an american movie might demand , scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a hollywood production .
the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny .
it's a movie forged in the fires of chick flick hell .
its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper .
any one episode of the sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes .
feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the lifetime cable television network .
lanie's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she's driven by ambition and does not know how to have fun .
credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
denzel washington's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony .
if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap ( literally ) .
so faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check .
rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next .
there's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent .
i can only imagine one thing worse than kevin spacey trying on an irish accent , and that's sultry linda fiorentino doing the same thing .
an awkward and indigestible movie .
the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs .
haneke keeps us at arm's length . guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens .
all the well-meaningness in the world ca not erase the fact that the believer feels like a number-step program for the jewish nazi .
like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness .
there's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong . this is an hour and a half of daydreaming .
message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ? alas , it's neither .
no movement , no yuks , not much of anything .

thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking . now it's just tired .
heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension .
the movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students .
a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his self-deprecating act against murphy's well-honed prima donna shtick .
a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it's sort of true and it's sort of bogus and it's ho-hum all the way through .
the movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark .
plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights .
it will come as no surprise that the movie is not scary . but here's the real damn : it is not funny , either .
quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ?
the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .
what you get with empire is a movie you have seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead .
cho's fans are sure to be entertained ; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i am not one of them .
looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter's imagination .
the period -- swinging london in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in gangster no . number , but falls apart long before the end .
high crimes miscasts nearly every leading character .
the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .
de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal .
i did not believe for a moment in these villains or their plot .
another rent installment for the ian fleming estate .
with danilo donati's witty designs and dante spinotti's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children's movie -- if only benigni had not insisted on casting himself in the title role .
so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun .
though it draws several decent laughs , it's low-cal woody at best .
has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags .
britney's performance cannot be faulted . lucy's a dull girl , that's all .
" the kid stays in the picture " is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this cliff notes edition is a cheat .
well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons .
sadly , hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks .
if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna .
this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay .
just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story . or a profit . or some damn thing .
the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .
enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment .
the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep . i like frank the pug , though .
a restrained ribisi convinces as an italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones .
gee , a second assassin shot kennedy ? moot point .
a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face .
needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey .
the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr . desplechin is content to state it .
madonna still ca not act a lick .
even the imaginative gore ca not hide the musty scent of todd farmer's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the number alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship .
if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce .
the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .
serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in number . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .
do not let your festive spirit go this far .
though the book runs only about number pages , it is so densely packed . . . that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr . schepisi's seems skimpy and unclear .
hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading .
intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area .
sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .
director brian levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you will find on a french poodle .
. . . perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world .
suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let's just say the ingredients do not quite add up to a meal .
i would give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes .
movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of 'bold' revelation . but in number , such revelations wilt .
the timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off .
i admire it and yet cannot recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time .
a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy .
flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind .
even if you feel like you have seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness .
the story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence .
despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy .
mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
a recipe for cinematic disaster . . . part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part numbers spy spoof , it's all bad .
the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie's power as a work of drama .
another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through .
aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend . when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music .
outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time . we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .
much of what is meant to be 'inspirational' and 'uplifting' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing the movie's mindset .
well before it's over , beijing bicycle begins spinning its wheels .
home alone goes hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even steven spielberg would know how to do . besides , real movie producers are not this nice .
nelson's movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised , unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes .
passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes . for me , this opera is not a favorite , so it's a long time before the fat lady sings .
looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due .
truth to tell , if you have seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there's nothing here you have not seen before .
abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists .
even die-hard fans of japanese animation . . . will find this one a challenge .
filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low . fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water .
the movie gets muted and routine .
the issue of faith is not explored very deeply
it's a bad sign when you are rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .
the situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .
it's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high .
i was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness .
k-number may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy saving private ryanovich .
a very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale . . . a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more .
automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf .
black-and-white and unrealistic .
the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off .
feels less like it's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers .
ja rule and kurupt should have gotten to rap . it would have benefitted the dialogue .
a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas .
elicits more groans from the audience than jar jar binks , scrappy doo and scooby dumb , all wrapped up into one .
it's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school .
in the end , white oleander is not an adaptation of a novel . it's a flashy , star-splashed reduction .
this film , starring anthony hopkins and chris rock , is your typical 'fish out of water' story . you have seen them a million times . just one problem : fish out of water usually die . this one does .
the angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging .
a soggy , shapeless mess . . . just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie .
men in black ii has sequel-itis something fierce . an ungainly , comedy-deficient , b-movie rush job . . .
a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move .
an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living .
say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue .
after seeing swept away , i feel sorry for madonna .
instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart's war , like the st . louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started .
two-bit potboiler .
a gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of moore's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crème brûlée .
maudlin and melodramatic we expected . boring we did not .
never quite transcends jokester status . . . and the punchline does not live up to barry's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery .
the film's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place .
it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes .
a baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie woody allen has made in the last twenty years .
it wo not be long before you will spy i spy at a video store near you .
this film looks like it was produced in number , shelved for number years , and repackaged for a number audience .
propelled not by characters but by caricatures .
there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .
this extremely unfunny film clocks in at number minutes , but feels twice as long .
earnest but earthbound . . . a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast .
the pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film ca not help but go soft and stinky .
for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero .
a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie .
if i spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it's trying to reap from the moviegoing public .
frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music .
places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .
stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition  wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text  when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type .
a very average science fiction film .
undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters .
how anyone over the age of number can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us .
the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap .
the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .
the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .
ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness .
those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an number-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida . or , you can do something fun tonight .
jolie's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips .
as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure .
static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , hey arnold ! would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year .
for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear .
un thriller manqué qui tombe sur les nerfs presque dès la première image .
when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon numberever .
what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about .
while benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that .
yes , numberever is harmless in the extreme and it will mute your kids for nearly number minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ?
preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure .
calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls .
none of these characters resembles anyone you have ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter .
. . . just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise .
as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame .
splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers' puppet strings .
. . . has virtually no script at all . . .
will only satisfy those who ca not tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly .

the film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own .
an imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie .
muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for kevin costner .
too clumsy in key moments . . . to make a big splash .
just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that's neither original nor terribly funny .
`matrix'-style massacres erupt throughout . . . but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with kafka-inspired philosophy .
at least it's a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii .
it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .
wanker goths are on the loose ! run for your lives !
why would anyone cast the magnificent jackie chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ?
a grating , emaciated flick .
unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .
presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency .
we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .
. . . unbearably lame .
according to the script , grant and bullock's characters are made for each other . but you would never guess that from the performances .
the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies .
ararat feels like a book report
steve oedekerk is , alas , no woody allen .
a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless .
an amalgam of the fugitive , blade runner , and total recall , only without much energy or tension .
the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing .
shows that jackie chan is getting older , and that's something i would rather live in denial about
with miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , killing me softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it's-good camp .
alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick .
the slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat .
this is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks .
the problem with the mayhem in formula number is not that it's offensive , but that it's boring .
much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché .
the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale
mark wahlberg . . . may look classy in a 'numbers-homage pokepie hat , but as a character he's dry , dry , dry .
told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject .
the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own .
now i can see why people thought i was too hard on " the mothman prophecies " .
if ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it . if ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .
with an unusual protagonist ( a kilt-wearing jackson ) and subject matter , the improbable " formula number " is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger .
sandra bullock's best dramatic performance to date ( is ) almost enough to lift ( this ) thrill-kill cat-and-mouser . . . above its paint-by-numbers plot .
a feel-good movie that does not give you enough to feel good about .
adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service . '
this mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost .
the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .
de niro cries . you will cry for your money back .
slap me , i saw this movie .
the kid's just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow .
behind the glitz , hollywood is sordid and disgusting . quelle surprise !
scherfig , who has had a successful career in tv , tackles more than she can handle .
just consider what new best friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay .
oscar caliber cast does not live up to material
the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .
carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , 'if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . '
so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film .
in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .
starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichés .
sometimes makes less sense than the bruckheimeresque american action flicks it emulates .
one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation .
there's only one way to kill michael myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies .
bland but harmless .
'rare birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience .
the movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive .
resident evil is what comes from taking john carpenter's ghosts of mars and eliminating the beheadings . in other words , about as bad a film you are likely to see all year .
five screenwriters are credited with the cliché-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before .
the whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of bewitched that takes place during spring break .
well made but uninvolving , bloodwork is not a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery .
so we got ten little indians meets friday the numberth by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter's the thing and loaded with actors you are most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat .
the movie's blatant derivativeness is one reason it's so lackluster .
la de salma es una versión de frida superficial , preciosista y sin ningún contenido .
kids do not mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there's lots of cute animals and clumsy people . 'snow dogs' has both .
it's almost as if it's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film .
wobbly senegalese updating of " carmen " which is best for the stunning star turn by djeinaba diop gai
it's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who does not think about percentages all day long .
ken russell would love this . in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino's climactic shootout  and meat loaf explodes .
bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies . this is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer .
the premise of " abandon " holds promise , . . . but its delivery is a complete mess .
what could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess .
a little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon wedding serves mostly to whet one's appetite for the bollywood films .
unless bob crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film's impressive performances and adept direction are not likely to leave a lasting impression .
the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects .
the bottom line with nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted need not waste their time on it .
the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington's fine performance in the title role .
the whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas .
what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !
the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film .
opera on film is never satisfactory . the art demands live viewing . the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .
despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless .
it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
the sweetest thing leaves an awful sour taste .
it's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay .
terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing . . . the movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable .
as dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy .
aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships .
a low-rent retread of the alien pictures .
serviceable at best , slightly less than serviceable at worst .
its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche .
a big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on .
the story has little wit and no surprises .
the merchant-ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage .
what should have been a cutting hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week's issue of variety .
hey everybody , wanna watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children's party clown gets violently gang-raped ? i did not think so .
a little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt .
dense and enigmatic . . . elusive . . . stagy and stilted
this slop does not even have potential as a cult film , as it's too loud to shout insults at the screen .
the movie's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .
. . . may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence . this scarlet's letter is a . . . as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary .
plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp .
the central character is not complex enough to hold our interest .
a modestly comic , modestly action-oriented world war ii adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight .
a puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .
just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be .
a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium .
there's a heavy stench of 'been there , done that' hanging over the film . it's everything you would expect -- but nothing more .
the biggest problem with satin rouge is lilia herself . she's a cipher , played by an actress who smiles and frowns but does not reveal an inner life .
a quaint , romanticized rendering .
what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song .
the movie's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness .
a potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted .
woody allen used to ridicule movies like hollywood ending . now he makes them .
she's not yet an actress , not quite a singer . . .
not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best .
been there done that .
there is only so much baked cardboard i need to chew .
a movie like the guys is why film criticism can be considered work .
schnitzler's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying .
even if it made its original release date last fall , it would have reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness .
only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience .
a loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target .
lame and unnecessary .
a movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture . we can tell what it is supposed to be , but ca not really call it a work of art .
it's a brilliant , honest performance by nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic kathy bates turns up . bravado kathy !
. . . liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . too bad .
you can thank me for this . i saw juwanna mann so you do not have to .
unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .
basically , it's pretty but dumb .
this romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in .
squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare .
there's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at number minutes , but kang tacks on three or four more endings .
reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition . it has no affect on the kurds , but it wore me down .
the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen .
co-writer/director jonathan parker's attempts to fashion a brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short .
if this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it .
a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find .
if there's a heaven for bad movies , deuces wild is on its way .
comes off like a bad imitation of the bard .
what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough .
an uninspired preachy and clichéd war film .
horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is not incomprehensible .
a movie that harps on media-constructed 'issues' like whether compromise is the death of self this orgasm wo not be an exceedingly memorable one for most people .
slackers' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by .
if festival in cannes nails hard- boiled hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing .
the movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value .
i have not seen such self-amused trash since freddy got fingered .
little more than a well-mounted history lesson .
rob schneider's infantile cross-dressing routines fill the hot chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian .

the film is so bad it does not improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen .

when it comes to the battle of hollywood vs . woo , it looks like woo's a p . o . w .
there are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies .
the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film .
it's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast .
the mushy finale turns john q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker .
content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance .
the movie turns out to be assayas' homage to the gallic 'tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness .
its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack , might have made a point or two regarding life .
seems even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels .
it's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread .
neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie is not tough to take as long as you have paid a matinee price .
if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh .
what might have been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors .

it's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere .
boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect .
it's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . unfortunately , that's precisely what arthur dong's family fundamentals does .
has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick .
like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen .
something must have been lost in the translation .
becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring .
in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we are looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses .
chan's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy .
rock's stand-up magic wanes . hopkins , squarely fills the screen . action - mechanical .
" the tuxedo " should have been the vehicle for chan that " the mask " was for jim carrey . alas , it's the man that makes the clothes .
for casual moviegoers who stumble into rules expecting a slice of american pie hijinks starring the kid from dawson's creek , they will probably run out screaming .
the biggest problem i have ( other than the very sluggish pace ) is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing .
what puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in britney spears' first movie .
plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king .
city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for . but how it washed out despite all of that is the project's prime mystery .
whatever the movie's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet t-shirt and shower scenes .
as a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , murder by numbers fits the profile too closely .

amid the cliché and foreshadowing , cage manages a degree of casual realism . . . that is routinely dynamited by blethyn .
mostly , shafer and co-writer gregory hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor .
no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild .
eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm does not do a load of good .
strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression .
there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes .

derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone .
deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits .
. . . comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental .
brosnan's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes .
a film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact .
to me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy .
tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often .
flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they ca not distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up .
zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted .
a crushing disappointment .
how can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ? in truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick ( but none of the sheer lust ) .
nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that's giving it the old college try .
episode ii-- attack of the clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight .
the problem with all of this : it's not really funny .
denis' bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a 'numbers exploitation picture than the finished product .

viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet .
overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste .

writer-director walter hill and co-writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags .
there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces .
a cockeyed shot all the way .
lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but ultimately you will leave the theater wondering why these people mattered .

cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth .
the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold .
seems like someone going through the motions .
for a film about explosions and death and spies , " ballistic : ecks vs . sever " seems as safe as a children's film . well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies .
wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste .
impostor does not do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast .
wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it is not as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited .
choppy , overlong documentary about 'the lifestyle . '
one sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot .
a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised .
it's a fanboy 'what if ? ' brought to life on the big screen .
the story itself is actually quite vapid .
it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does not offer any insights that have not been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'numbers .
wait for pay per view or rental but do not dismiss barbershop out of hand .
a few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady's direction is prosaic .
each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top .
would have been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film's predictable denouement . then nadia's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all .

nair just does not have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .
enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , walt becker's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons .
it's the funniest american comedy since graffiti bridge .

a really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film .
aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .

for its number minutes running time , you will wait in vain for a movie to happen .
a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse .

for a film about action , ultimate x is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype .
. . . a low rate annie featuring some kid who ca not act , only echoes of jordan , and weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school .
it might not be numbers animation , but everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons  a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .
the picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain .
tends to plod .
a nearly number/number hours , the film is way too indulgent .
gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid . . . a curiously constricted epic .
it looks much more like a cartoon in the end than the simpsons ever has .
with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral .

everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized .

a muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations . it makes me say the obvious : abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here .
mildly entertaining .
it's not original enough .
a listless sci-fi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect .
terrible .
little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its summer x games .
degenerates into hogwash .
a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is not merely offensive .
julie davis is the kathie lee gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does not always go hand in hand with talent .
an unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled 'hip' , 'innovative' and  arealistic' .
the story's pathetic and the gags are puerile .
. curiously , super troopers suffers because it does not have enough vices to merit its number-minute length .
so bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled generic jennifer lopez romantic comedy .
i was sent a copyof this film to review on dvd . for free . i still want my money back .
it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its " dead wife communicating from beyond the grave " framework is even remotely new or interesting .
it's hard to believe that a relationship like holly and marina's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive .
all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces' appeared in number .
passable enough for a shoot-out in the o . k . court house of life type of flick . strictly middle of the road .
although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .
after the first number minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés , depression and bad alternative music .
no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive .
a very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel .
with little visible talent and no energy , colin hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee .
" feardotcom " has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker .
a meatballs for the bare-midriff generation .
well-meaning to a fault , antwone fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man's triumph of will into everyman's romance comedy .
seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product's unshapely look , director fisher stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in waking life water colors .
formula number promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip .
everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel .
a few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot has not the stamina for the number-minute running time , and the protagonists' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun .
the film was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) .
disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel .
coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock .
anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .
how much you are moved by the emotional tumult of françois and michèle's relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them .
they presume their audience wo not sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes .
collapses after number minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence .
the following things are not at all entertaining : the bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching seinfeld ( who is also one of the film's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy .
attal's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it's a wonder that he could not have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident .
obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .
the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters .
michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously .
ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies . enigma lacks it .
potty-mouthed enough for pg-number , yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults .
. . . has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon does not quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites .
a distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour .
most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement .
in the end , tuck everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in .
rather less than the sum of its underventilated père-fils confrontations .
mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .
plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line .
new yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell . . .
amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way .
yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it's also a failure of storytelling .
a characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie .
a somewhat disappointing and meandering saga .
whenever you think you have seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end . but , no , we get another scene , and then another . you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain .
an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility .
the screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .
the milieu is wholly unconvincing . . . and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch .
unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters .
each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .
except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion .
will no doubt delight plympton's legion of fans ; others may find number minutes of these shenanigans exhausting .
the laughs are as rare as snake foo yung .
for a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , what to do in case of fire ? lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking .
knockaround guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be quentin tarantino when they grow up . but they lack their idol's energy and passion for detail .
mattei so completely loses himself to the film's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , love in the time of money .
it briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - audience sadism -- is evaded completely .
holland lets things peter out midway , but it's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .
for every articulate player , such as skateboarder tony hawk or bmx rider mat hoffman , are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words " radical " or " suck " into a sentence .
there's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale .
an impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle .
it's unfortunate that wallace , who wrote gibson's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue .
i liked the movie , but i know i would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further . i am left slightly disappointed that it did not .
dreary tale of middle-class angst
for a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either .
jackson and bledel seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd .
lillard and cardellini earn their scooby snacks , but not anyone else .
like schindler's list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way .
an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .
screenwriter pimental took the farrelly brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation .
it's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey .
friday after next is a lot more bluster than bite .
its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up .
a decidedly mixed bag .
meandering and confusing .
there are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels .
ice cube is not quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin .
not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending .
the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality .
everything else about high crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented .
just dreadful . i do not blame eddie murphy but should not owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ?
sweet home alabama certainly wo not be remembered as one of witherspoon's better films .
hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film .
this is just lazy writing . even kids deserve better .
the pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie . and diesel is not the actor to save it .
bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda .
. . . a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet .
frank capra played this story straight . but the number film does not really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate 'comedy' scenes .
how about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ?
the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull .
handled correctly , wilde's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice . here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked soufflé .
" sorority boys " was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad .
a bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder
paul bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number number .
it's a gag that's worn a bit thin over the years , though do not ask still finds a few chuckles .
an uplifting drama . . . what antwone fisher is not , however , is original .
often likable , but just as often it's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy .
certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , eight crazy nights is a total misfire .
elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side .
showtime is not particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again .
all the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams .
this tuxedo . . . should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations .
i have no problem with " difficult " movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out . but first , you have to give the audience a reason to <b>want</b> to put for that effort , and " i
been there , done that . . . a thousand times already , and better .
what's most offensive is not the waste of a good cast , but the film's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .
sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness .
fans of plympton's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers .
barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality .
none of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any 'comedy' to ever spill from a projector's lens .
the kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics .

the trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of showgirls .

what 'blade runner' would have looked like as a low-budget series on a uhf channel .
does not add up to much .
has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release .
with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the numbers .
it never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time .
loud , silly , stupid and pointless .
mandel holland's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by phifer and black are ultimately winning . you will find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie .
a yawn-provoking little farm melodrama .
did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ?
crummy
seriously , rent the disney version .
as david letterman and the onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them .

meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off kahlo's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant .

i am not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on johnny knoxville's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche .
while serving sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest austin powers extravaganza , there's nothing here to match that movie's intermittent moments of inspiration .
i am not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r . nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen .
the only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow .
whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors .
as with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .
the irwins' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts .

feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form .
while you have to admit it's semi-amusing to watch robert deniro belt out " when you are a jet , you are a jet all the way , " it's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to " tonight . "

a bad movie that happened to good actors .
wishy-washy .
boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome .
screenwriter dan schneider and director shawn levy substitute volume and primary colors for humor and bite .

if you saw benigni's pinocchio at a public park , you would grab your kids and run and then probably call the police .
the animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but jonah . . . never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment .
the pace of the film is very slow ( for obvious reasons ) and that too becomes off-putting .

what happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ?
despite some comic sparks , welcome to collinwood never catches fire .
director george hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place .

even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency .

the entire movie is in need of a scented bath .
i am sorry to say that this should seal the deal - arnold is not , nor will he be , back .

a movie to forget

exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair .

this is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives .
marinated in clichés and mawkish dialogue .
whether it's the worst movie of number , i ca not say for sure : memories of rollerball have faded , and i skipped country bears . but this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .
a boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain .
not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of 'eh . '
rollerball is as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine .
the first question to ask about bad company is why anthony hopkins is in it . we assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low .
not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .

a small independent film suffering from a severe case of hollywood-itis .
where the film falters is in its tone .
the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head .
ultimately , sarah's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness .

the result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel .
it appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichés the filmmakers could dredge up .
nothing but an episode of smackdown ! in period costume and with a bigger budget .
it takes you somewhere you are not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface ( and exotic dancing ) it's surprisingly old-fashioned .
while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .

a good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance .
a tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid .

aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production does not work for me .
a preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in brooklyn circa number .
has none of the crackle of " fatal attraction " , " number ½ weeks " , or even " indecent proposal " , and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of " lolita " .

an extraordinarily silly thriller .
a rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade .
gaping plot holes sink this 'sub'-standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth .
talkiness is not necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark .
the beautiful images and solemn words cannot disguise the slack complacency of godard's vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice .

final verdict : you have seen it all before .
throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material .
